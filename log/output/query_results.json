The Lorentz boosts\nimply non-associative addition of ternary relative velocities. Within\nEinstein's special relativity theory, each preferred observer (fixed stars,\naether, etc), determine the unique relative velocity among each pair of massive\nbodies. Therefore, the special relativity founded on Minkowski's axiom, that\neach pair of reference systems must be related by Lorentz isometry, needs a\npreferred reference system in order to have the unique Einstein's relative\nvelocity among each pair of massive bodies. This choice-dependence of relative\nvelocity violate the Relativity Principle that all reference systems must be\nequivalent. This astonishing conflict of the Lorentz relativity group, with the\nRelativity Principle, can be resolved in two alternative ways. Either, abandon\nthe Relativity Principle in favor of a preferred reference system [de Abreu\n2004; de Abreu and Guerra 2005, 2006]. Or, within the Relativity Principle,\nreplace the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid, with the\nchoice-free binary relative velocities introduced by Minkowski in 1908. Binary\n- means that the relative velocity is a function of a pair of reference\nsystems.
