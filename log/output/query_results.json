The system under development incorporates a number of Machine Learning\ntechniques, mostly using Bayesian approaches, due to the sparse nature,\nheterogeneity, and variable incompleteness of the available data. The\nclassifications are improved iteratively as the new measurements are obtained.\nOne novel feature is the development of an automated follow-up recommendation\nengine, that suggest those measurements that would be the most advantageous in\nterms of resolving classification ambiguities and/or characterization of the\nastrophysically most interesting objects, given a set of available follow-up\nassets and their cost functions.

To provide an answer, we study the problem of learning user\nratings for items under local or `user-end' differential privacy, a powerful,\nformal notion of data privacy.\n  We develop a systematic approach for lower bounds on the complexity of\nlearning item structure from privatized user inputs, based on mutual\ninformation. Our results identify a sample complexity separation between\nlearning in the scarce information regime and the rich information regime,\nthereby highlighting the role of the amount of ratings (information) available\nto each user.\n  In the information-rich regime (where each user rates at least a constant\nfraction of items), a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve optimal\nsample complexity. However, the information-scarce regime (where each user\nrates only a vanishing fraction of the total item set) is found to require a\nfundamentally different approach. We propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and\nshow that it achieves optimal sample complexity in this setting.\n  The techniques we develop for bounding mutual information may be of broader\ninterest. To illustrate this, we show their applicability to (i) learning based\non 1-bit sketches (in contrast to differentially private sketches), and (ii)\nadaptive learning, where queries can be adapted based on answers to past\nqueries.", "published": "2012-07-13T14:56:38Z", "title": "The Price of Privacy in Untrusted Recommendation Engines"}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4487v2": {"links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4487v2", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4487v2", "type": "application/pdf", "rel": "related", "title": "pdf"}], "author": "Frank Meyer", "authors": [{"name": "Frank Meyer"}], "summary": "This thesis consists of four parts: - An analysis of the core functions and\nthe prerequisites for recommender systems in an industrial context: we identify\nfour core functions for recommendation systems: Help do Decide, Help to\nCompare, Help to Explore, Help to Discover.
