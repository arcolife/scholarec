                                       'summary': u'Recently there has been much interest in data that, in statistical language,\nmay be described as having a large crossed and severely unbalanced random\neffects structure. Such data sets arise for recommender engines and information\nretrieval problems. Many large bipartite weighted graphs have this structure\ntoo. We would like to assess the stability of algorithms fit to such data. Even\nfor linear statistics, a naive form of bootstrap sampling can be seriously\nmisleading and McCullagh [Bernoulli 6 (2000) 285--301] has shown that no\nbootstrap method is exact. We show that an alternative bootstrap separately\nresampling rows and columns of the data matrix satisfies a mean consistency\nproperty even in heteroscedastic crossed unbalanced random effects models. This\nalternative does not require the user to fit a crossed random effects model to\nthe data.',
