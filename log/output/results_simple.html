                                       'summary': u'Recently there has been much interest in data that, in statistical language,\nmay be described as having a large crossed and severely unbalanced random\neffects structure. Such data sets arise for recommender engines and information\nretrieval problems. Many large bipartite weighted graphs have this structure\ntoo. We would like to assess the stability of algorithms fit to such data. Even\nfor linear statistics, a naive form of bootstrap sampling can be seriously\nmisleading and McCullagh [Bernoulli 6 (2000) 285--301] has shown that no\nbootstrap method is exact. We show that an alternative bootstrap separately\nresampling rows and columns of the data matrix satisfies a mean consistency\nproperty even in heteroscedastic crossed unbalanced random effects models. This\nalternative does not require the user to fit a crossed random effects model to\nthe data.',

The system under development incorporates a number of Machine Learning\ntechniques, mostly using Bayesian approaches, due to the sparse nature,\nheterogeneity, and variable incompleteness of the available data. The\nclassifications are improved iteratively as the new measurements are obtained.\nOne novel feature is the development of an automated follow-up recommendation\nengine, that suggest those measurements that would be the most advantageous in\nterms of resolving classification ambiguities and/or characterization of the\nastrophysically most interesting objects, given a set of available follow-up\nassets and their cost functions. This illustrates the symbiotic relationship of\nastronomy and applied computer science through the emerging discipline of\nAstroInformatics.',

The state of the art presents also purely content-based\nmethods, hybridization techniques, and the classical performance metrics used\nto evaluate the recommender systems. This state of the art then gives an\noverview of several systems, both from academia and industry (Amazon, Google\n...). - An analysis of the performances and implications of a recommendation\nsystem developed during this thesis: this system, Reperio, is a hybrid\nrecommender engine using KNN methods. We study the performance of the KNN\nmethods, including the impact of similarity functions used.

To provide an answer, we study the problem of learning user\nratings for items under local or `user-end' differential privacy, a powerful,\nformal notion of data privacy.\n  We develop a systematic approach for lower bounds on the complexity of\nlearning item structure from privatized user inputs, based on mutual\ninformation. Our results identify a sample complexity separation between\nlearning in the scarce information regime and the rich information regime,\nthereby highlighting the role of the amount of ratings (information) available\nto each user.\n  In the information-rich regime (where each user rates at least a constant\nfraction of items), a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve optimal\nsample complexity. However, the information-scarce regime (where each user\nrates only a vanishing fraction of the total item set) is found to require a\nfundamentally different approach. We propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and\nshow that it achieves optimal sample complexity in this setting.\n  The techniques we develop for bounding mutual information may be of broader\ninterest. To illustrate this, we show their applicability to (i) learning based\non 1-bit sketches (in contrast to differentially private sketches), and (ii)\nadaptive learning, where queries can be adapted based on answers to past\nqueries.",

As an introduction to the Special Issue on Smart, Social and Converged\nTelevision, this extended editorial intends to review the current IP television\nlandscape in its many realizations: operator-based, over-the-top, and user\ngenerated. We will address new services like social TV and recommendation\nengines, dissemination including new paradigms built on peer to peer and\ncontent centric networks, as well as the all important quality of experience\nthat challenges services and networks alike. But we intend to go further than\njust review the existing work by proposing areas for the future of television\nresearch. These include strategies to provide services that are more efficient\nin network and energy usage while being socially engaging, novel services that\nwill provide consumers with a broader choice of content and devices, and\nmetrics that will enable operators and users alike to define the level of\nservice they require or that they are ready to provide. These topics are\naddressed in this survey paper that attempts to create a unifying framework to\nlink them all together. Not only is television not dead, it is well alive,\nthriving and fostering innovation and this paper will hopefully prove it.',

                                       'summary': u"Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for\npotential romantic partners. It is important to understand users' dating\npreferences in order to make better recommendations on potential dates. The\nmessage sending and replying actions of a user are strong indicators for what\nhe/she is looking for in a potential date and reflect the user's actual dating\npreferences. We study how users' online dating behaviors correlate with various\nuser attributes using a large real-world dateset from a major online dating\nsite in China. Many of our results on user messaging behavior align with\nnotions in social and evolutionary psychology: males tend to look for younger\nfemales while females put more emphasis on the socioeconomic status (e.g.,\nincome, education level) of a potential date. In addition, we observe that the\ngeographic distance between two users and the photo count of users play an\nimportant role in their dating behaviors. Our results show that it is important\nto differentiate between users' true preferences and random selection. Some\nuser behaviors in choosing attributes in a potential date may largely be a\nresult of random selection. We also find that both males and females are more\nlikely to reply to users whose attributes come closest to the stated\npreferences of the receivers, and there is significant discrepancy between a\nuser's stated dating preference and his/her actual online dating behavior.\nThese results can provide valuable guidelines to the design of a recommendation\nengine for potential dates.",
