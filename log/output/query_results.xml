    <title>The pigeonhole bootstrap</title>
    <summary>  Recently there has been much interest in data that, in statistical language,
may be described as having a large crossed and severely unbalanced random
effects structure. Such data sets arise for recommender engines and information
retrieval problems. Many large bipartite weighted graphs have this structure
too. We would like to assess the stability of algorithms fit to such data. Even
for linear statistics, a naive form of bootstrap sampling can be seriously
misleading and McCullagh [Bernoulli 6 (2000) 285--301] has shown that no
bootstrap method is exact. We show that an alternative bootstrap separately
resampling rows and columns of the data matrix satisfies a mean consistency
property even in heteroscedastic crossed unbalanced random effects models. This
alternative does not require the user to fit a crossed random effects model to
the data.

    <title>Towards an Automated Classification of Transient Events in Synoptic Sky
  Surveys</title>
    <summary>  We describe the development of a system for an automated, iterative,
real-time classification of transient events discovered in synoptic sky
surveys. The system under development incorporates a number of Machine Learning
techniques, mostly using Bayesian approaches, due to the sparse nature,
heterogeneity, and variable incompleteness of the available data. The
classifications are improved iteratively as the new measurements are obtained.
One novel feature is the development of an automated follow-up recommendation
engine, that suggest those measurements that would be the most advantageous in
terms of resolving classification ambiguities and/or characterization of the
astrophysically most interesting objects, given a set of available follow-up
assets and their cost functions. This illustrates the symbiotic relationship of
astronomy and applied computer science through the emerging discipline of
AstroInformatics.

    <title>Recommender systems in industrial contexts</title>
    <summary>  This thesis consists of four parts: - An analysis of the core functions and
the prerequisites for recommender systems in an industrial context: we identify
four core functions for recommendation systems: Help do Decide, Help to
Compare, Help to Explore, Help to Discover. The implementation of these
functions has implications for the choices at the heart of algorithmic
recommender systems. - A state of the art, which deals with the main techniques
used in automated recommendation system: the two most commonly used algorithmic
methods, the K-Nearest-Neighbor methods (KNN) and the fast factorization
methods are detailed. The state of the art presents also purely content-based
methods, hybridization techniques, and the classical performance metrics used
to evaluate the recommender systems. This state of the art then gives an
overview of several systems, both from academia and industry (Amazon, Google
...). - An analysis of the performances and implications of a recommendation
system developed during this thesis: this system, Reperio, is a hybrid
recommender engine using KNN methods. We study the performance of the KNN
methods, including the impact of similarity functions used. Then we study the
performance of the KNN method in critical uses cases in cold start situation. -
A methodology for analyzing the performance of recommender systems in
industrial context: this methodology assesses the added value of algorithmic
strategies and recommendation systems according to its core functions.

    <title>The Price of Privacy in Untrusted Recommendation Engines</title>
    <summary>  Recent increase in online privacy concerns prompts the following question:
can a recommendation engine be accurate if end-users do not entrust it with
their private data? To provide an answer, we study the problem of learning user
ratings for items under local or `user-end' differential privacy, a powerful,
formal notion of data privacy.
  We develop a systematic approach for lower bounds on the complexity of
learning item structure from privatized user inputs, based on mutual
information. Our results identify a sample complexity separation between
learning in the scarce information regime and the rich information regime,
thereby highlighting the role of the amount of ratings (information) available
to each user.
  In the information-rich regime (where each user rates at least a constant
fraction of items), a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve optimal
sample complexity. However, the information-scarce regime (where each user
rates only a vanishing fraction of the total item set) is found to require a
fundamentally different approach. We propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and
show that it achieves optimal sample complexity in this setting.
  The techniques we develop for bounding mutual information may be of broader
interest. To illustrate this, we show their applicability to (i) learning based
on 1-bit sketches (in contrast to differentially private sketches), and (ii)
adaptive learning, where queries can be adapted based on answers to past
queries.

    <title>Surveying the Social, Smart and Converged TV Landscape: Where is
  Television Research Headed?</title>
    <summary>  The TV is dead motto of just a few years ago has been replaced by the
prospect of Internet Protocol (IP) television experiences over converged
networks to become one of the great technology opportunities in the next few
years. As an introduction to the Special Issue on Smart, Social and Converged
Television, this extended editorial intends to review the current IP television
landscape in its many realizations: operator-based, over-the-top, and user
generated. We will address new services like social TV and recommendation
engines, dissemination including new paradigms built on peer to peer and
content centric networks, as well as the all important quality of experience
that challenges services and networks alike. But we intend to go further than
just review the existing work by proposing areas for the future of television
research. These include strategies to provide services that are more efficient
in network and energy usage while being socially engaging, novel services that
will provide consumers with a broader choice of content and devices, and
metrics that will enable operators and users alike to define the level of
service they require or that they are ready to provide. These topics are
addressed in this survey paper that attempts to create a unifying framework to
link them all together. Not only is television not dead, it is well alive,
thriving and fostering innovation and this paper will hopefully prove it.

    <title>Idea of a new Personality-Type based Recommendation Engine</title>
    <summary>  Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types depict the psychological preferences
by which a person perceives the world and make decisions. There are 4 principal
functions through which the people see the world: sensation, intuition,
feeling, and thinking. These functions along with the Introverted\Extroverted
nature of the person, there are 16 personalities types, the humans are divided
into. Here an idea is presented where a user can get recommendations for books,
web media content, music and movies on the basis of the users' MBTI type. Only
things like books and other media content has been chosen because the
preferences in such things are mostly subjective. Apart from the recommended
content that is generally generated on the basis of the previous purchases,
searches can be enhanced by using the MBTI. A minimalist survey was designed
for collecting the data. This has a more than 100 features that show the
preference of a personality type. Those include preferences in book genres,
music genres, movie genres and even video games genres. After analyzing the
data that is collected from the survey, some inferences were drawn from it
which can be used to design a new recommendation engine for recommending the
content that coincides with the personality of the user.

    <title>Who is Dating Whom: Characterizing User Behaviors of a Large Online
  Dating Site</title>
    <summary>  Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for
potential romantic partners. It is important to understand users' dating
preferences in order to make better recommendations on potential dates. The
message sending and replying actions of a user are strong indicators for what
he/she is looking for in a potential date and reflect the user's actual dating
preferences. We study how users' online dating behaviors correlate with various
user attributes using a large real-world dateset from a major online dating
site in China. Many of our results on user messaging behavior align with
notions in social and evolutionary psychology: males tend to look for younger
females while females put more emphasis on the socioeconomic status (e.g.,
income, education level) of a potential date. In addition, we observe that the
geographic distance between two users and the photo count of users play an
important role in their dating behaviors. Our results show that it is important
to differentiate between users' true preferences and random selection. Some
user behaviors in choosing attributes in a potential date may largely be a
result of random selection. We also find that both males and females are more
likely to reply to users whose attributes come closest to the stated
preferences of the receivers, and there is significant discrepancy between a
user's stated dating preference and his/her actual online dating behavior.
These results can provide valuable guidelines to the design of a recommendation
engine for potential dates.
