        **ScholaRec** is a Python library that makes scholarly recommendations,
        currently based on documents from ArXiv.
        
	This software has been built due to a need felt for a proper
	recommendation system for publicly available scholarly/research works.
	It classifies documents and uses personalization features to
	suggest/recommend similar ones, possibly of interest to the user.
	
	Note: This package comes along with a web interface made in Django. [`Github 
	Link <https://github.com/arcolife/django-scholarec>`__, arcolife/django-scholarec]
	

	A simple arXiv API call can be achieved by executing the following code:
        .. code:: python

          >>> import scholarec
          >>> from scholarec.base.arxiv import DocumentArXiv
	  >>> url = "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:%22higgs%22&start=0&max_results=2"
	  >>> from urllib2 import urlopen
	  >>> query_xml = urlopen(url)
	  >>> doc = DocumentArXiv(query_xml)
	  >>> data_dict = doc.extract_tags()
	  >>> for entry_id in data_dict.keys():
	  ...     print "ID: %s" % (entry_id)
	  ...     print(data_dict[entry_id]), "\n"
