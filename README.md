==============
Recommendation of Scholarly Works 
---------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/scholarec.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/scholarec)

This software has been built due to a need felt for a proper recommendation system for publicly available scholarly/research works. It classifies documents and uses personalization features to suggest/recommend similar ones, possibly of interest to the user.
