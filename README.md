scholarec v0.1
==============
Recommendation of Scholarly Works 
---------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/scholarec.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/scholarec)

This software has been built due to a need felt for a proper recommendation system for publicly available scholarly/research works. It classifies documents and uses personalization features to suggest/recommend similar ones, possibly of interest to the user.

**Installation**

> It is under heavy development currently, so instead of 'install', 
> use 'develop' with setup.py for now. Keep doing 'git pull' on the repo clone. 

$ sudo python setup.py develop

**Usage**

To use the module in a Python script, simply import:

import scholarec


To see if the scripts runs without error

$ ./tests/run-tests.sh
$ ./tests/test.py


To go for a sample run (Later, have a look at the following script to see how the module works.)

$ ./tests/query_parse

Note: For developing a small database from arXiv, you need to run the query_parse script and accept "Extract PDF" option for extracting related pdf's, converting them to plain text and extracting interesting words that would later be used for recommendations and suggestions.
