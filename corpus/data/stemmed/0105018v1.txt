abstract
the mass and the decay width of a higg boson in the minim standard
model are evalu by a variat method in the limit of strong selfcoupl
interact the nonperturb techniqu provid an interpol scheme
between strongcoupl regim and weakcoupl limit where the standard
perturb result are recov in the strongcoupl limit the physic
mass and the decay width of the higg boson are found to be veri small as
a consequ of mass renorm thu it is argu that the eventu
detect of a light higg boson would not rule out the exist of a strongli
interact higg sector

the impress success of the standard model sm ha enforc the common believ
that the higg boson will be soon detect by the new gener of acceler 1 in fact
there are two unknown paramet in the sm that wait for their experiment determin
the mass m of the higg boson and the strength of it selfcoupl interact thi last
one determin the bare higg mass m20 v 2 3 where v is the vacuum expect valu for
the scalar field which is fix by the known strength of weak interact thu at tree level
perturb theori predict a light higg mass m m0 if the coupl is small enough
convers in the strong coupl limit perturb theori break down and there is no
simpl relat between m and a light weakli interact higg boson ha been strongli
desir mainli becaus perturb theori would be reliabl and the higg boson would
be detect at a reason energi threshold howev if natur had chosen for a strongli
interact boson the physic would be richer and more interest actual the physic
of such a strongli interact higg boson ha been explor in the last twenti year and
interest propos have been discuss rang from the exist of bound state 28
to unconvent descript of the symmetri break mechan 9
dure the last year the possibl of a strongli interact higg boson ha been
reject for two main reason i a larg is believ to impli a larg mass in contrast
with the recent phenomenolog evid 1 for a light m 100 200 gev ii for a
strongli interact higg boson the decay width ha been predict to be veri larg
1011 compar to the mass and such veri larg reson could hardli be regard as
a true particl in thi letter we point out that both the statement i and ii have a
perturb natur and cannot be trust in the strong coupl limit at tree level m and
are small if the coupl is small which is consist in the framework of perturb
theori howev if is veri larg ani perturb argument break down and fail to
predict what m and are in fact by use of a variat method we show that both m and
are small in the strong coupl limit
the exist of a satur of m at strong coupl ha been shown by sever nonperturb techniqu as 1n expans 11 variat method 12 and bethesalpet
2
equat 13 we have shown that a further increas of the coupl strength yield a decreas of the mass 12 and thi ha also been confirm by recent bethesalpet calcul
13 the physic reason is veri simpl at tree level m is proport to howev the
interact renorm the mass sinc the attract selfcoupl reduc the energi of a
free boson at some stage thi reduct overcom the tree level increas and the renorm mass decreas for some veri larg self coupl as a result a light higg boson
could be a veri strongli interact particl whose ground state could even be a higgshigg
bound state
a light selfinteract higg boson would not make ani sens as a free particl if it decay
width would be so larg and increas with as found by 1n expans calcul
11 howev in the real world the goldston boson of the on model do not play ani
physic role while the higg sector is coupl with the gaug boson through a quit weak
interact which doe not increas with as could be expect we show that for veri larg
coupl and a reason choic of the cutoff a light higg boson would be character
by a veri small decay width thu the experimant knowledg of m and would not say
the last word on the strength of the selfinteract the eventu detect of a light higg
with a narrow decay width would be consist with both a perturb weakli interact
and a nonperturb strongli interact theori
in order to deal with the nonperturb limit we use a variat method in the
hamiltonian formal 141668 the method ha the advantag of yield the known
perturb result in the weakcoupl limit 168 eg mass decay width and bind
energi while it can be safe extend to the nonperturb strong coupl regim
the result achiev by such method have not been appreci in the past sinc the variat equat have been usual approxim by perturb method 17 thu spoil
their most import advantag in the framework of a studi on bound state we have recent shown 12 that the variat equat can be decoupl exactli give import
consequ on mass renorm in thi letter we show that the same method can
be use for decoupl the variat equat aris from a more complet trial state

thi is the lagrangian of a u1 higg model scalar electrodynam which is equival
to the full sm lagrangian as far as we onli consid the trial state 1 the variat
principl 6 yield four coupl integr equat eigenvalu equat for the coeffici

we may take c p c p moreov up to a vacuum renorm we may

publish elsewher here we discuss the result in the two special case c 0 and g 0
for c 0 there is no decay and the trial state 1 is an improv over the hh hhh
variat ansatz of ref 12 here we have one extra equat aris from the variat
with respect to a in eq6 howev the extra coeffici a is a constant which can be
easili elimin yield two coupl integr equat we regular the logarithm

thu in the perturb limit the present variat calcul and standard covari
perturb theori are in perfect agreement in the opposit strongcoupl regim we
alreadi know that accord to fig1 the physic higg mass m can be consider less
than the bare mass m0 the selfcoupl enter the scatter wave in eq12 onli through
the bare mass m0 in the factor e even in the veri strong coupl limit e doe not
chang too much and is of order uniti for m e m0 it take the limit valu e 49
the nonperturb decay width follow 8 as n p mbw 49bw thu apart
from the prefactor the decay width is obtain by insert the renorm higg mass
m in the standard perturb result 17 as a consequ whatev is the strength of
the selfcoupl if the physic higg mass is small the decay width remain small in the
z 0 z 0 reson we do not see how thi scenario could be chang by the inclus of
other process
our find are not in disagr with the so call equival theorem 211822
which state that at high energi the scatter amplitud of longitudin boson are
equival to the scatter amplitud of their correspond wouldb goldston boson
7
in fact the higg boson and the goldston boson are coupl by the same interact
strength which is assum to be larg in the strongcoupl limit howev in the higg
mechan the goldston boson are not physic sinc the correspond degre of freedom
are taken by the longitudin polar of the massiv vector boson it is onli at high
energi that the scatter amplitud of the longitudin gaug boson are well describ by
the unphys amplitud of the goldston boson in the strongcoupl limit the higg
mass is kept small by the renorm effect and the higg reson at e m is a low
energi process which cannot be describ by use of the equival theorem
we must mention that by 1n expans in the strongcoupl limit ghinculov and
binoth 11 find a larg decay width that increas with even beyond the satur of
m these author do not explor the veri strong coupl regim where the higg mass is
small besid their expans start from a on symmetr sigma model which contain
the unphys goldston boson and their calcul contain a tachyon pole which is
regular by a perturb method thu it is not clear if their method can be regard
as a genuin nonperturb approxim and if their find can be compar to our
low energi calcul for the decay width
the exist of a quit extend strongcoupl rang where the physic higg mass
m is small increas the chanc of detect the higg boson below the tev scale howev a strongli interact light higg would differ from a weakli coupl one for sever
detect aspect for instanc the exist of bound state would be the signatur of a
strongli interact higg sector while parturb theori would be enough for a weakli
interact boson the role of nonperturb calcul would be determin if the
higg field turn out to be strongli selfcoupl
in summari by a nonperturb variat method we have shown that in the strongcoupl limit the mass of the higg boson would be small as a consequ of mass renorm moreov the decay process at e m would be a low energi process character by a small decay width thu in order to establish if the higg sector is weakli or
strongli interact the eventu detect of a light higg boson will not be enough and
8
the more gener phenomenolog ha to be consid and compar with the predict
of nonperturb calcul
