introduct
as it is well known the dna macromolecul is constitut by two linear chain of nucleotid in
a doubl helix shape there are four differ nucleotid character by their base adenin
a and guanin g deriv from purin and cytosin c and thymin t come from
pyrimidin t be replac by uracil u in rna the genet inform is transmit
via the messeng ribonucl acid or mrna dure thi oper call transcript the
a g c t base in the dna are associ respect to the u c g a base through a
complic biochem process a tripl of nucleotid or codon will be relat to an aminoacid more precis a codon is defin as an order sequenc of three nucleotid therefor
there are 43 64 differ codon onli 20 differ aminoacid appear in the peptid chain
which form the protein we list them with the standard abbrevi alanin ala arginin
arg asparagin asn aspart acid asp cystein cy glutamin glnglutam acid
glu glycin gli histidin hi isoleucin ile leucin leu lysin ly methionin
met phenylalanin phe prolin pro serin ser threonin thr tryptophan trp
tyrosin tyr valin val it follow that the genet code ie the associ between
codon and aminoacid is degener in the vertebr mitochondri code vmc see tabl
1 60 of such tripl are connect to 20 the aminoacid the remain 4 codon call nonsens or stopcodon and denot by the symbol ter play the role to stop the biosynthesi
sinc the discoveri of the genet code 1 a coupl of veri puzzl question have arisen whi
onli twenti amino acid aa are use in natur to build up protein whi the genet code
ha a peculiar structur in multiplet rang from sextet to singlet in particular for vmc
2 sextet 7 quartet and 12 doublet for the eukaryot or standard genet code 3 sextet 5
quartet 2 triplet 9 doublet and 2 singlet an attempt to explain the exist of onli 20
amino acid is given by the hypothesi that origin the quantum of code inform wa
transmit by a pair of nucleotid instead that by the present tripl of nucleotid codon
and 4x4 16 is a number close to 20 howev thi explan is in contradict with other
hypothesi on the structur of the primordi code quadrupl of nucleotid or a subset of the
present 64 tripl other explan are base on correspond between the properti of
the amino acid and the structur of the correspond codon although it seem now clear
that a correspond of thi kind exist and it can explain whi some amino acid are encod
by more codon than other it is not evid how the interplay between aa and codon lead
to the exist multiplet structur a strong and probabl correct argument make appeal to
stabil consider ie to state that the the genet code ha remain unchang over
a vast time period becaus it ha adopt the most appropri organis to oppos the
most frequent and lethal chang howev no consist model at my knowledg ha been
propos to explain the actual multiplet structur in the light of the abov statement it is
known that the translat error are the main sourc of devast effect in the construct
of the polypetid chain error in read the nucleotid in 3rd posit are more frequent
than error in read the nucleotid in 1st posit and the latter are more frequent than those

the literatur on the genet code is extrem larg for a recent review with a wide select of refer
to the origin paper see 1

in 2nd or central posit clearli a protect against the translat error repres by
transit ie the replac by a pyrimidin purin by the other pyrimidin purin
which are the most common mutat is obtain by encod the same aa by codon of
the form xzi or xzr in the follow the standard notat is use
x z n c u g a

codon encod the same aa ie belong to the same multiplet are call synonym
similarli aa encod by codon of the form xzn are in some way protect by the effect
of the translat error repres by tranvers pyrimidin into purin or viceversa but
whi there are onli six or five quartet whi do onli two or three sextet appear whi
the quartet and sextet have the structur they have for the first two nucleotid xz the
complet stabil against read error is in obvio conflict with the advantag to encod
mani aa so to allow a veri larg varieti of byosynthesi product it is the aim of thi paper
to propos a mathemat model which may explain both the number of the natur amino
acid and the structur in multiplet the framework in which the model is propos is the
crystal basi model of the genet code 2 in which the 4 nucleotid are assign to the 4dim irreduc fundament represent irrep 12 12 of uq0 sl2 sl2 with the
follow assign for the valu of the third compon of j for the two sl2 which in the
follow will be denot as slh 2 and slv 2

and the codon tripl of nucleotid to the 3fold tensor product of 12 12 we report
in tabl 1 the assign of the codon to the differ irrep and the correspond with
the encod aa in the vertebr mitochondri vmc and in the standard univers genet
code suc let us emphas that the assign of the codon to the differ irrep is
a straightforward consequ of the assum behaviour of the nucleotid eq2 and of the
theorem on the tensor product of irrep in the crystal basi 3 the idea of thi work is to
mathemat repres the effect of translat error by suitabl crystal tensor oper
4 impos stabil of the genet code with respect to these error ie that codon which
are most sensit to be read in a wrong way correspond to synonym codon in the encod
process we find the main featur of the multiplet structur of the vmc which is believ to
repres a primordi form of the code and of suc the paper is organis as it follow in
sec 2 the gener idea of modelis of misread of codon are introduc in sec 3 a
detail discuss of the consequ of the mathemat modelis is given inde in
order to studi the depend of the result from the assumpt of the oper mimick
the translat error two mathemat scheme are analys discuss which result are
model depend in sec 4 a critic discuss of the obtain result as well as some direct
for further develop are present

modelis of misread of codon
we assum on phenomenog ground that there is a hierarchi in the occurr of translat error and in order of decreas intens we consid
1 the transit in particular c u or g a concern nucleotid in the 3rd posit
2 the tranvers in particular c g u a and c a in the nucleotid in 3rd
posit
3 the transit resp tranvers concern nucleotid in 1st posit
4 the transit resp tranvers concern nucleotid in 2nd posit
5 the mutat induc by the transit resp tranvers on the first two nucleotid
transit tranvers of the nucleotid in the middl posit will be consid far weaker
than transit tranvers in other posit both on phenomenog ground and on
the argument that in the spirit of the hierarch structur of the intens of mutat
the chang of the other nucleotid is prefer inde there are phenomenog argument
confirm also by our model that these chang can be neglect howev we prefer to discuss
the translat error in the abov order as it allow the most natur introduct of the
mathemat structur of the oper modelis the error the hierarchi in the translat
error mechan mean that a multiplet form in a level is frozen in the subsequ level
the merg of two whole multiplet in a larger structur is possibl if it is induc by the
relev tensor oper if the transit is allow onli for some member of a multiplet
there is conflict between the choic of merg the multiplet in a larger one so decreas the
varieti of encod aa but increas the protect or preserv the multiplet decreas
the level of protect in thi case the format of larger structur will gener take place
or not accord to the rule to protect the weakest codon ie the codon more inclin to
be misread we assum that misread of nucleotid c or a is the most common howev
in the follow we shall discuss in some detail each of these case let us emphas that we
want to build the most simpl model in which the codon which are most subject to read
error are synonym in thi spirit the explicitli analys transit c u g a
or transvers c g u a c a have not to be consid as the onli possibl
chang but as the repres which allow the most simpl modelis in other word
transit and transvers in the revers direct happen but the protect against their
effect is assur onc the concern codon belong to the same multiplet we consid onli
the transvers decreas or leav unchang the valu of jh3 the tranvers u g
impli the increas of one uniti of jh3 therefor it is not explicitli consid thi is an
essenti irrelev simplif becaus it is possibl to show that a suitabl modelis
of thi transvers leav the obtain result unmodifi
in the follow we recal briefli the main properti of the q 0tensor oper or
crystal tensor oper 4 for a gener uq0 sl2 they transform as
j
j
j m
m1
j
j
j3 m
mm
3

j
clearli if m j then m
ha to be consid vanish the state j1 m1 will be connect
j
by the q 0tensor oper m
to the state jm by the q 0wignereckart theorem if
jm j1 m1 jm
4
a peculiar featur of the wignereckart theorem in the limit q 0 is that the select
rule do depend not onli on the rank of the tensor oper and on the initi state but in a
crucial way from the specif compon of the tensor in consider the state jm can
be explicitli comput up to irrelev numer factor by perform the tensor product
accord to the rule given in 3 of irrep j1 and j the tensor product of two irreduc
represent in the crystal basi is not commut therefor one ha to specifi which
is the first represent in the product a final import remark it is clear from the
tabl 1 that there are gener more than one irrep label by the same valu of jh jv
whose content in the constitu nucleotid is differ the transform properti of
a crystal tensor oper determin which state is relat to an initi one onli accord
to the irrep to which the initi state belong therefor the mathemat modelis by
mean of an uniqu tensor oper is expect to be too simpl and inadequ inde the
nucleotid are molecul with veri differ physicalchem properti while in the crystal
basi model they all are handl on the same basi as vector of an irreduc modul moreov
it can be expect that some read error of a nucleotid depend also from the natur of the
neighbour nucleotid in the follow we shall take in some way into account thi fact by
a suitabl choic of the natur of the tensor oper notwithstand these simplif of
the mathemat modelis it is quit amaz how mani featur of the organis of
the genet code can be obtain note that in order not to overload the notat we do not
explicitli specifi the action of the oper on the nucleotid but onli their transform
properti under uq0 slh 2 slv 2 hope it will be clear from the context which kind
of process we are consid

we model the transit and the transvers by the follow crystal tensor oper the

where the valu of a b c and d depend on the posit insid the codon of the misread
nucleotid and on the irrep to which the codon belong see below the abov choic for
the horizont resp vertic part of the crystal vector oper in eq5 rep eq6 is
inde the most simpl choic accord to the chang in the label of the state of codon
for transit resp transvers the choic of the rank of the vertic resp horizont
part of the crystal oper in eq5 resp eq6 as well as the tensor oper modelis
4
the tranvsers c a is someway arbitrari it is inde a way of take into account in
mathemat languag the chemic differ between the nucleotid and the differ in
the mechan respons for misread nucleotid in differ posit insid the codon
the valu of the rank of the oper modelis the translat error in 2nd posit will
be gener assum larger than the one describ error in 1st posit and the latter one
will be gener assum larger than the one describ error in 3rd posit so to model
the less frequent misread in particular in the scheme we shall discuu more in detail for
a
the transit the rank a of the vertic tensor oper v0
will be assum to be 0 1 2
respect for transit in 3rd 1st and 2nd posit in the tensor product with the state
the crystal oper h v will be consid in the second posit a codon eg
xzn will be consid subject to a translat error eg to be read as xzn if the crystal
oper modelis the relev translat error will connect in the sens abov explain
the state xzn with the state xzn where xzn is the state in the irrep of
uq0 slh 2 slv 2 see tabl 1 specifi the codon xzn
31
substitut of 3rd nucleotid
to studi the transit in 3rd posit in the codon xzc and xzg where x and z are
ani nucleotid we consid the action of the oper given by eq5 with a 0 on the
correspond state in the follow the equat have to be read by the western rule from
left to right

we impos the codon xzc resp xzg and xzu resp xza to be synonym if the

accord to the q 0wignereckart theorem we
get the split of the 64 codon in 32 doublet of the form xzr and xzi remark that the

final pattern is unchang if in eq8 we replac v0
by v0
to studi the tranvers in 3rd

where in eqs101112 b 2 if the dinucleotid xz ie the state form by the first
two nucleotid in the initi codon belong to an irrep with jv 0 or is a state with
lowest weight for slv 2 or for slh 2 if jh 0 2 see tabl 2 ie when the first two
nucleotid are ca ga cg ug ua uu au aa gg ag and b 1 otherwis we
have previous given argument to motiv the introduct of differ tensor oper to
describ the misread of the same nucleotid in differ codon it is just a simpl way of
mathemat mimick the depend of the translat error or misread from the
5
neighbour nucleotid for the transit which impli error in the translat betwen
member of the same chemic famili the tensor oper depend onli from the posit in
the codon of the misread nucleotid let us comment more on the mathemat mean of
our assumpt due to the peculiar properti of the crystal basi the tensor oper can
be assum to consist of a part let us say with definit transform properti with
respect to the gener of uq0 sl2 sl2 act on the first two nucleotid and of
a part let us say with definit transform properti with respect to the gener of
uq0 sl2 sl2 act on the whole codon under the action of the state of initi codon
chang into a virtual state transform by into a final state if the label of the final
state correspond to the label of the state describ the codon the transvers is induc
otherwis it is not allow ie there is no misread thi kind of reason is appli in the
b
case of substitut of two nucleotid see subsect 34 the choic of a differ rank of h0
in eq 10 11 12 is a simpl way to take into account thi complex mechan one may
reformul the abov condit as it follow in eqs1011 b 2 if the codon and the one
obtain by transvers belong to the same irrep or if the initi codon belong to an irrep
with jh 23 and b 1 otherwis in eq12 b 2 if the codon xzc and xzu belong to the
same irrepand b 1 otherwis these condit are simpler but the depend of the rank
of the oper also from the irrep of the final codon may sound unsatisfactori it turn out
that
eq10 forbid transvers uuc uug auc aug aac aag uac uag
gac gag and cac cag
eq11 forbid transvers uuu uua auu aua aau aaa uau uaa
agu aga gau gaa ugu uga and cau caa
eq12 forbid transvers uuc uua auc aua aac aaa uac uaa
agc aga gac gaa ugc uga and cac caa
therefor we obtain the merg of 16 doublet in 8 quartet the quartet be the codon
whose the first two nucleotid are cc cu cg uc gg gc gu and ac let us note
that the transit agc agg and ugc ugg are allow a way of insur protect
without decreas the number of amino acid encod is to make an appropri choic for
the codon agg and ugg in the encod process ind in vmc the first is a stop codon
while the second encod for a a veri rare amino acid trp at thi stage the assign of the
codon differ for the 3rd nucleotid to differ multiplet is decid the next step can
produc the join of doublet and quartet in quartet or sextet or in a priori octet
let us studi what it is obtain if we chang the mathemat modelis of the direct
transvers c g u a in 3rd posit use the follow oper

act on it in the sens that the label of the state

in the spirit of the hierarch strength of misread error a quartet will be form sure
if both the codon xzr are transform in xzi it turn out the merg of 16 doublet
in 8 quartet the quartet be the codon whose the first two nucleotid are cc cu cg
uc gg gc gu and ac it turn out also that
in agc urc cac and gac the nucleotid c in 3rd posit can be transform in g
while in agu and ugu the nucleotid u in 3rd posit cannot be transform in a
in uuu and auu the u in the end posit can be transform in a while in uuc and
auc the c cannot be transform in u
let us analys more in detail the function and physicalchem properti of the doublet
in which onli one state is subjetc to misread we remark that uay and agi encod
in vmc the stop codon moreov the the physicalchem properti of hi encod vy
cay asp gay cy ugi and asn aay are respect close to the properti pf gln
car glu gar trp ugr and ly aar 2 moreov in suc there is a break
of the doublet auy aua merg with the doublet auy in a triplet encod for ile it is
tempt to draw the conclus that when the push to form a larger multiplet act onli on
some codon the natur seem to choos to have a larger varieti of aa choos the codon
subject to misread or as stop or to encod affin aa as a final remark modelis the

accord to the strategi of protect of the weakest codon abov outlin a fusion of a
doublet with a quartet in a sextet or with anoth doublet in a quartet resp of two quartet
into an octet happen if at least the transit of the codon with c or a in 3rd posit resp
of the codon with c and a in 3rd posit is allow in the light of the abov criterion onli
the merg of the doublet uur and the quartet cun in a sextet is expect and inde we
obtain the sextet encod leu then let us analys the tranvers in first posit

as a consequ the doublet agr merg into the quartet cgn form anoth sextet encod for arg remark that the establish pattern remain unchang if the rank of h in
both eqs1718 is fix 1 or 2 so at thi stage the multiplet structur of the 64 codon is
2 sextet 6 quartet and 14 doublet 2 of which are split in singlet we get almost the

one comput that the follow transit happen

accord to the strategi abov outlin we expect
1 the fusion of the doublet car and uar and gar and aar respect in two quartet
8
2 the fusion of the doublet uur resp ugr aur agr and the quartet cun resp
cgn gun ggn in sextet
a way to satisfi the stabil condit without decreas the number of aa synthet is to
make an appropri choic for the stop codon as alreadi remark in fact the decreas of
an encod aa is avoid choos uar as stop codon moreov the doublet uur merg
with the quartet cun in the sextet encod leu while in vmc ugr encod a rare aa
trp and in suc the doublet is split in two singlet ugg encod trp and uga state
subject to mutat encod ter the fusion of agr with ggn doe not happen but in
vmc thi doublet encod for stop codon and in suc merg in anoth sextet as we shall
see below while the quartet gar and aar is not found howev it is worth to note that
some physicalchem properti of the two encod aa glu and ly are veri close see 5
and that the two codon are form onli by purin with prevail nucleotid a may be also
that the requir of the merg of two doublet into a quartet when onli the codon with
a a nucleotid in the final posit is subject to error is a too strong condit so we have
found further argument in favour of uay and agi be stop codon then let us analys
the tranvers c a which can be read as the result of c g a due to the tensor
oper

it turn out that onli the transvers cxa axa is allow as a consequ we expect
the merg of the doublet agr with the quartet cgn of the doublet aur with the quartet
cun and eventu of the two doublet aar and car onli the first sextet is observ
but the doublet aur encod the start codon in vmc and is split out in suc
33
substitut of central nucleotid
the translat error in the 2nd nucleotid occur veri rare so we consid it as weak intens
effect assum that it cannot modifi the alreadi establish pattern in doublet and quartet
but onli to possibl caus the merg of whole multiplet we modelis the transit as

22
from the result of previou subsect we know that the codon with c or g in first posit
and c or u in the central posit are organis in quartet therefor onli an octet is the
possibl larger multiplet accord to the gener strategi follow the fusion of two quartet
is possibl if at least the follow transit vck vuk v c g k c a are allow
for the codon with u or a in first posit and c in second posit the fusion of a quartet
wck w u a and a doublet wur resp wuy in a sextet is possibl if at least the

vgn v c g with a doublet var resp vay is possibl if at least the transit vga
vaa resp vgc vac final the fusion of two doublet wgr and war w u a
resp wgi and way should take place if at least the transit wga waa resp wgc

wac is allow it turn out that all the abov list transit are forbidden inde
onli the transit ccc cuc and gcc guc are allow
let us analys the tranvers in second posit

turn out
eq23 allow the transvers mcc mgc m c
eq24 doe not allow ani transvers
eq25 allow onli the tranvers ccc cac ucu uau and acu aau
it turn out that one should expect the fusion in a sextet of the quartet ucn and of the doublet
ugi as the transit ucc ugc is allowedthi sextet doe not appear in the genet code
but as we shall see in the follow subsect inde the quartet ucn merg with the doublet
agr one should also expect the fusion in a sextet of the quartet ccn and the doublet cay
which inde doe not happen both these result suggest that the misread of the central
nucleotid is a veri weak effect if not enhanc by the simultan misread of the first
2
nucleotid see the follow subsect remark that in eq23 we might write h0
which
leav the final result unchang with thi choic also the transit ccc cgc is allow
34
substitut of two nucleotid
the read error in a coupl of nucleotid is an event occur less frequent than the
translat error of one nucleotid in last or initi posit therefor we gener expect a
weaker effect than the previous consid one nucleotid chang consequ we assum
that they cannot modifi the alreadi establish pattern in doublet and quartet so we
consid onli the possibl action on the two initi nucleotid the transit and tranvers
of the first second nucleotid is modelis by the same oper use for the translat or
transvers on the first nucleotid see eqs16171819 see eqs222324 25 in
the follow we denot with a lower label the posit of the nucleotid where the oper
act the action of the twonucleotid oper ha to be comput in the follow way as
first step one ha to comput the action of the oper label by i give rise to a virtual
state with the label assign by the action of the relev oper on the initi state of the
codon then one consid the action of the oper label by ii on the virtual state and
get the label of the final state if these label are the one denot in tabl 1 the state
correspond to the codon the transit is allow for exampl to analys the transit

conclus
befor discuss what we have obtain let us summar what we have done the start
point is the observ pattern in multiplet of the genet code from it invari in time
and from it almost univers charact we infer that such a pattern ha to ensur an effici
and stabl translat in the build of polypeptid chain ie it is error proof against the
most frequent read error to give a quantit and precis mean to thi statement
we need to build a mathemat model both for the genet code and for the misread
mechan in the crystal basi model each codon is repres as a state jh jv jh3jv3 in
the modul space of uq0 sl2 sl2 the 64 state are separ in nine differ invari
subspac label by a coupl of halfinteg jh jv the mechan impli translat
error are modelis by suitabl tensor oper with definit transform properti under
uq0 sl2 sl2 which may or may not relat two state of such state if the state are
connect we infer that they can be mistaken in the translat process and therefor in
order to ensur in case of misread the synthesi of the same aa the correspond codon
have to be synonim by studi the action of the oper we obtain the split of
the 64 state in a set of multiplet repres almost faith the degeneraci of the genet
code the simpl propos mathemat modelis is abl in an amaz way to account
12
almost for the exist af onli 20 aa and almost for the structur of the vmc and suc
whi the natur use the 20 particular aa enumer in the begin of thi paper in the
practic unlimit varieti of these molecul is still to be understood and of cours is far
beyond the aim of thi work the structur of the mathemat oper use to model
transit and tranvers is simpl but arbitrari therefor it is worth to discuss in a more
quantit way the extent of the obtain result let us use as start point the pattern of
the 64 codon group in 32 doublet even if thi result is less obviou that one can naiv
think of inde from tabl 1 one realiz that 8 of the 16 doublet of the form xzi resp
xzr belong to differ irrep therefor the vector oper given in eqs8 9 oper
in half the case as a gener and in half case as an intertwin oper the transvers
oper induc the merg of 16 doublet in 8 quartet in full agreement with the observ
pattern of the genet code the format of onli 8 quartet with the correct content in the
first two nucleotid induc by the action of oper eqs10 11 12 is a good result
especi consid that the number of differ choic of 8 quartet in 16 doublet is 12870
onc form the quartet the oper eq16 induc the format of 2 sextet which are the
correct one between the 420 possibl final the oper eq34 induc the format
of the correct 3rd sextet betwwen 24 possibl in conclus it is extremeki surpris that
such an arbitrari choic explain whi and in which pattern of multiplet with a probabl
to find the correct pattern of about 7 7 109 the remain 60 codon encod onli 20 amino
acid we have invenstig the depend of the pattern obtain from the structur of the
tensor oper use to modelis the misread process differ do appear in the differ
modelis studi but most of the pattern of the genet code is obtain show that
there is a bulk of it organis littl sensit to the detail of the oper modelis
the misread process thi featur appear also in other modelis not discuss in the
paper eg modelis the transit and transvers as a two step process delet of a
nucleotid and subsequ creation of a differ one a veri few differ depend also
from the choosen scheme exist between the theoret pattern of organis in multiplet
and the observ one in particular some minor chang in the eukaryot code do not find an
explan in the model even if for some of them the model give hint in the correct direct
further refin or more probabl the presenc of some other mechan whose action
is not modelis by crystal tensor oper may account for these chang and for the not
appear of an expect 4th sextet in the second mathemat scheme howev it should
remark that thi sextet is form by ccn and cay where cc resp ca is the highest
weight resp the lowest weight in the dinucleotid set
in our model the strategi follow by the genet code seem to be adress to keep the
most varieti of encod amino acid consist with a reason level of protect of the
codon against the most common translat error a fundament problem not all face
in thi paper is the reason for the observ correspond between multiplet and amino
acid in other word onc obtain the organis in differ multiplet of the genet code
there is a mechan impos which particular amino acid have to be encod by sextet
quartet and so on or it is just a random event stereochem hypothesi 6 7 suggest
that the physicalchem properti of the amino acid play a crucial role to determin the
13
correspondennc between multiplet and amino acid a clear shortcom of the model is
the fact that the analysi of the format of the differ multiplet is peform in a static
manner while it is believ although no unambig model doe exist that an evolut of the
genet code and of the correspond encod amino acid ha happen it is inde in the
evolut that rule and properti of the system which are necessari to the exist of live
organ are fix and select the select which domin biolog ha not at all taken
into account in the present oversimplifi model howev hope thi kind of reason can
be appli to model describ the evolut process one may argu that in a more refin
model differ oper should be use to modelis differ mutagen effect whose role
and intens depend on the in time chang environ we point out also that the one
may conjectur to modelis spontan and induc mutat of the genet code by suitabl
tensor oper a first analysi of thi type ha been given in 8 in conclus the model
present in thi paper state that the genet code is what it is becaus it is optim at
least for the environ in which it wa form and not for a freez random event of
cours the word optim should be taken in a loos sens as we have not quantit
describ the gain of the differ choic we believ that in thi context method of game
theori can be appropri use to a better descript
