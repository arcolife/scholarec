the aim of thi work is the mathemat analysi of the physic timerevers oper and
it definit as a geometr structur in such a way that it could be gener to the pure
mathemat realm rigor onli have such a timerevers structur it can be decid
whether a dynam system is timesymmetr or not the timerevers structur of sever
import physic and mathemat exampl are present show that there are some mathemat categori whose object are the classic or abstract timerevers system and whose
morphism gener the wigner transform
i introduct
the dynam and the thermodynam of both classic and quantum physic system are model by the
mathemat theori of classic and abstract dynam system it is obviou that the physic notion of timesymmetr or asymmetr dynam system requir the definit of a timerevers oper k 17 in fact
everi known model of a physic dynam system ha some k oper eg the dynam of classic physic
system is describ in the cotang fiber bundl t n of it configur manifold n and therefor the action of
k t n t n is defin as
pq pq
1
for ani linear function p on q n or in coordin languag
q i pi q i pi
2
in a particular q i pi coordin system
in quantum mechan there is the well known wigner antiunitari oper k defin through the complex
conjug in the posit wave function represent
x t x t
3
in the last few year it wa demonstr that ordinari quantum mechan with no superselect sector can be
natur includ in the hamiltonian formal of it real kahlerian differenti manifold of quantum state 6 7
8 the latter one is the real but infinit dimension manifold of the associ project space ph of it hilbert
state space h 1 from thi point of view k ph ph act as the cannon project to the quotient of 3
x t x t
4
moreov thi result ha been gener to more gener quantum system through it characterist calgebra a
and it pure quantum state space ka turn out to be a project kahler bundl over the spectrum a whose fiber
over the class of a state is isomorph to ph be h it gn gelfandnaimarksegal represent space
9 more recent these author have relax the kahlerian structur show minim mathemat structur
involv in the quantum principl of superposit and uncertainti with the aim of consid non linear extens
of quantum mechan 10
1
we should rememb the fact that ordinari pure quantum state are not vector normal or not of a hilbert space h
but ray or project equival class of vector ph
1
but what happen in more gener dynam system some of them such as the bernouilli system and certain
kolmogorovsystem 2 are pure mathemat nevertheless the notion of timesymmetri seem to make sens
also for them so it would be interest to know what kind of mathemat structur are involv in these system
our aim is to show that
1the mere exist of the time revers oper is a mathemat structur consist of a non trivial involut
k of the state space of a gener system with holonom constraint m which split into a kinvari submanifold
coordinat by q i and whose complementari set the field of the effect action of k coordinat by pi is a
manifold with the same dimens of m thi structur is logic independ of the symplect one 1 which
doesnt requir such a split at all in fact the essenc of symplect geometri as it own etymolog show is
the common envelop of q and p loos ani privileg between them actual thi kstructur is defin
by the action of that part of the complet galilei group includ the timerevers which is allow to act on the
phase space manifold m by the constraint in fact onli on the homogen euclidean phase space m r6n it is
possibl to have the transit action 14 of the complet galilei group
2it is possibl to defin gener and pure mathemat timerevers allow a gener of the
notion of timesymmetri for a wider class of dynam system includ all bernouilli system in fact there
are mathemat categori whose object are the timerevers classic or abstract system m k and whose
morphism gener the wigner transform 25
3when the state space ha addit structur there is a possibl of get a richer timerevers compat
with these structur for exampl in classic mechan the canon k is a symplectomorph of phase space
and the wigner quantum oper is compat with the kahlerian structur of ph at first sight 2 is quit
similar to 3 and it seem to be some kind of complex conjug and the even dimension of phase space
reinforc thi idea we will prove thi fact name the exist of an almost complex structur j with respect to
which k is an almost complex timerevers thi increas the analog with quantum mechan where the strong
version of the heisemberg uncertainti principl 7 8 is equival to the exist of a complex structur j by
mean of which the wigner timerevers is defin
4it is possibl to make a definit of timerevers system so gener that it includ among it exampl the
real line the minkowski spacetim the cotang fiber bundl the quantum system the classic densiti function
space the quantum densiti oper space the bernouilli system etc
the paper is organ as follow in section 2 the gener theori of revers and timerevers system is
develop in section 3 the theori of abstract revers and abstract timerevers system is given in section
4 mani import exampl of timerevers system are given in section 5 we give the abstract timerevers of
bernouilli system and we show explicitli the geometr mean of our definit for the baker transform
ii revers and timerevers system
definit let m be a real paracompact connect finit or infinitedimension differenti manifold and let
k m m be a diffeomorph we will say that k is a revers on m and that m k is a revers system if
the follow condit are satisfi
r1 k is an involut ie k 2 im
r2 the set n of all fix point of k is an immers submanifold of m such that m n is a connect or
disconnect submanifold of the same dimens of m in particular thi impli that m is a non trivial involut
ie k im the ident function on m
we will say that n is the invari submanifold of the revers system
definit let m k be a revers system we will say that m is korient if m n is compos of two
diffeomorph connect compon m y m and if
km m and km m
5
m is korient when convent or arbitrarili one of these compon is select as posit orient in that case k chang the korient of m
if there is a complex or almost complex structur j on m and therefor j j is anoth one and if in
addit k satisfi
cr k is complex or almost complex as a map from m j to m j m j ie
k j j k
we will say that k is a complex or almost complex revers or a conjug
2
6
similarli if a symplect or almost symplect 2form is given on m 2 and therefor is anoth one
and if in addit to r1 y r2 k satisfi
sr k is a symplectomorph from m to m m ie
k
7
we will say that k is a symplect or almost symplect revers if we have a symplect or almost symplect
revers system m k then for everi
m m k tm m tm m
is a toplinear isomorph and if
i n m is the immers iq m
and i xq xiq is the induc isomorph we can defin an almost complex structur j
j xiq ym xiq ym 1
j ym xiq
8
that is to say by defin the pair of conjug vector and extend by linear then
k xiq xiq k ym ym
when m j g is a k
ahler or almost k
ahler manifold and k satisfi the properti r1 r2 cr and
sr we will say that k is a k
ahlerian or almost k
ahlerian revers in that case k is also an isometri
k g g
9
gx y x jy for all vector field x and y
10
with respect to the k
ahler metric g defin by
definit let m k be a revers system such that there is a class f of flow st tr or and cascad
st s t tz on m such that for ani m m and ani t in r or in z satisfi
k st km st m
11
then we will say that k is a timerevers for f on m in physic we can take f as a class of physic interest
for exampl in classic mechan we can take the class of all hamiltonian flow over a fix phase space and in
quantum mechan the class of solut of the schroding equat in a fix state space etc
onli have a timerevers on m timesymmetr or asymmetr dynam system st flow st tr
or cascad st s t tz can be defin in fact st will be consid as symmetr with respect to the
timerevers k if it fulfil m m the condit 11 or asymmetr if it doesnt
when m is orient orient with respect to a timerevers k we will say that it is timeorient orient
definit by a morphism of the revers system m k into m k we mean a differenti map f of m
into m such that
f k k f
12
as the composit of two morphism is a morphism and the ident im is a morphism we get a categori
of revers system whose object are the revers system and whose morphism are the morphism of revers
system also we have the subcategori of symplect almost complex kahlerian etc revers system
2
in the infinitedimension case we requir to be strongli nondegener 10 in the sens that the map x x is a
toplinear isomorph
3
iii abstract revers and abstract timerevers system
definit let m be a measur space and let k m m be an isomorph mod 0 2 we will say that
k is an abstract revers on m and that m k is an abstract revers system if the follow condit
are satisfi
ar1 k is an involut ie k 2 im mod 0
ar2 the set n of all fix point of k is a measur subset of null measur of m and so m n m
in particular thi impli that m is a non trivial involut ie k im the ident function on m
we will say that n is the invari subset of the abstract revers system
definit let m k be an abstract revers system such that there is a class f of measur preserv flow
st tr or and cascad st s t tz on m such that for all m m and all t in r or in z it satisfi 11 then
we will say that k is a time revers for f on m
onli have an abstract timerevers on m timesymmetr or asymmetr abstract dynam system st
flow st tr or cascad st s t tz can be defin in fact st will be regard as symmetr with respect
to the timerevers k if it fulfil m m the condit 11 or asymmetr if it doesnt
definit by a morphism of the abstract revers system m k into m k we mean a measur
map f of m into m such that a m measur
f 1 a a mod 0
13
f k k f
14
and
as the composit of two morphism is a morphism and the ident im is a morphism we get a categori of
abstract revers system whose object are the abstract revers system and whose morphism are the morphism
of abstract revers system
iv exampl of timerevers system
we will see how the mathemat structur just describ can be implement in all the classic and quantum
physic system and also gener to more abstract pure mathemat dynam system as the bernouilli
system
a the real line
let us consid in the real line r the map k r r defin by
kt t
15
clearli r is korient becaus if n 0 then r 0 r r and k is a canon timerevers for
the famili of translat for a r fix and t r
sta x x ta
16
b the minkowski spacetim
let r4 be the minkowski spacetim with diag 1 1 1 1 the invari submanifold is the spacelik
hyperplan
n 0 x y z x y z r
clearli fix m as the halfspac contain the forward light cone
ct x y z c2 t2 x2 y 2 z 2 0 and t 0
4
and m as the halfspac contain the backward light cone
ct x y z c2 t2 x2 y 2 z 2 0 and t 0
and defin k r4 r4 by
kct x y z ct x y z
17
we get a canon korient equival to the ussual timeorient k is a timerevers with respect to the
tempor translat
sta x x ta x0 ta0 x1 x2 x3
18
for a a0 0 0 0 r4 a0 0 fix and t r
remark as an effect of curvatur not everi gener 4dimension lorentzian manifold m g will be timeorient 18 nevertheless a timeorient gener spacetim is necessari if we are search for a model of a
univers with an arrow of time 3 4 in fact if our univers were repres by a nontimeorient manifold
it would be imposs to defin past and futur in a global sens in contradict with all our present cosmolog
observ precis we know that there are no part of the univers where the local arrow of time point differ
from our own arrow
c the cotang fiber bundl classic mechan
a gener cotang fiber bundl need not to be korient nevertheless we have the follow result
theorem the cotang fiber bundl of a finit dimension differenti manifold t n n 1 ha a
canon almost k
ahlerian timerevers for the hamiltonian flow on it
proof let m be the cotang fiber bundl t n of a real ndimension manifold n in thi case n is an
embed submanifold of m be the embed i n t n such that
iq 0q the null function at q
let defin
k t n t n
pq tq n kpq pq
19
becaus of it definit thi map is obvious an involut and by it linear is differenti and it differenti
or tangent map
k t t n t t n
verifi
k xpq
xpq if xpq i tq n
xpq if xpq tpq 1 q
20
xpq tpq 1 q mean that it is vertic or tangent to the point pq of the fibr in q it must be taken into
account that by join a vertic base with the imag of a base in n by the isomorph i we get a base of
tpq t n
let be the canon symplect 2form of the cotang fiber bundl as is antisymmetr in order to evalu
k it is suffici to consid onli three possibl
1 xpq ypq
xpq ypq i tq n
2 xpq ypq
xpq ypq tpq 1 q
3 xpq ypq
xpq i tq n but ypq tpq 1 q
in case 1
k xpq k ypq xpq ypq 0
5
21
in case 2
k xpq k ypq xpq ypq xpq ypq 0
22
in case 3
k xpq k ypq xpq ypq
xpq ypq
23
thu in ani case
k xpq ypq k xpq k ypq xpq ypq
24
which prove that k the sr properti
now let us defin
j t t n t t n
jxpq ypq xpq ypq 1
25
that is to say jxpq is the canon conjug of xpq
then by the antisymmetri of clearli j 2 i in addit
k j xpq k jxpq j xpq
j k xpq
j k xpq
26
if xpq i tq n and
k j xpq k jxpq jxpq
j k xpq
j k xpq
27
if xpq tpq 1 q so k preserv both and j and therefor is almost kahlerian
as it is well known the phase space m of a classic system with a finit number n of degre of freedom and
holonom constraint ha the particular form t n where n denot the configur space of the system thi
impli the exist of a privileg submanifold n of m we may enquir whi is thi so the answer is becaus
everi law of classic mechan is invari with respect to the galilei group which contain all the spatial translat
and it is itself a contract of the inhomogen lorentz group 13 thi forc the configur space to be a
submanifold of some homogeneuo rd space now in thi submanifold we also have a privileg system of coordin
the spatial posit coordin q1 x1 qd xd with respect to which the action of the galilei group ha it
simplest affin express nevertheless in gener thi action will take us away from the configur manifold n
becaus it doesnt fit with the constraint think for exampl in the configur space of a doubl pendulum with
two unit thread which is a 2toru contain in r3
d classic statist mechan

t n
let us consid the phase space of a classic system t n and take the real banach space v lr
contain the probabl densiti over the phase space where n time is the liouvil measur
v is a real infinit dimension differenti manifold model by itself then the abov defin almost kahlerian
timerevers k on t n induc k v v by
k k m km
28
clearli k is a toplinear involut now let us consid the set p of all almost everywher equival class
of keven integr function
6
p v km m
29
and the set i of all almost everywher equival class of the kodd integr function
i v km m
30
trivial v p i and there are two toplinear projector map ani v into it keven and kodd
part p is the invari subspac of k it complement is the infinit dimension open submanifold of almost
everywher equival class of integr function whose kodd project doesnt vanish
now everi dynam system st in particular those of the class f of k on t n induc anoth dynam
system ut on v
ut m st m
31
consid the class f induc by f we conclud that k is a timerevers
so we have anoth exampl lack time orient but have a timerevers structur
e complex banach space
a complex structur on a real finit or infinit banach space v is a linear toplinear transform j of v
such that j 2 i where i stand for the ident transform of v 14
in the case of a complex banach space vc we can consid the associ real vector space it realif
v vr compos of the same set of vector but with r instead of c as the field of it scalar then j ii is the
canon complex structur of vr
if j is a complex structur on a finit dimension real vector space it dimens must be even in ani case there
exist element x1 x2 xn of v such that
x1 xn jx1 jxn
is a basi for v 14
let us defin k v v as the conjug ie extend by linear the assign
i 1 2 kxi xi kjxi jxi
32
then the real subspac gener by x1 x2 is the subspac of fix point of k n so v j k is a complex
timerevers system for the class of non real translat sta tr a be a linear combin of jx1 jxn
sta x x ta t r
33
in fact
k sta k x k kx ta x ta

34
f ordinari quantum mechan system
as a particular case of the previou exampl let us consid a classic system whose phase space is r6n and
take v h l2 r3n actual it realif thi choic is motiv by the fact that we want to have a
galileiinvari quantum mechan and so we must quantifi the spatial posit coordin there is no cannon
or symplect symmetri here onli act on the wave function of the posit coordin the wigner timerevers
oper will be express as the complex conjug so we get a complex timerevers structur
now follow 7 let us consid the real but infinit dimension kahlerian manifold ph j g of the
associ project space ph of the hilbert state space h of an ordinari quantum mechan system j is the
complex structur of h and it is the local expres of
7
j t ph t ph
ph j g ha a canon k
ahlerian timerevers structur in fact we defin k h h as in the previou
exampl and take
k ph ph by k k
then all the desir properti follow easili
g quantum statist mechan
let v l1 h denot the complex banach space gener by all nuclear oper on h with the trace norm thi
set contain the densiti oper of quantum statist mechan v is a real infinit dimension differenti
manifold model by itself then the abov defin complex timerevers k on h induc k v v by
k k k
35
clearli k is a toplinear involut now let us consid the set r of all kreal densiti
r v k
36
and the set i of all the kimaginari densiti
i v k
37
trivial v r i and there are two toplinear projector map ani v into it kreal and kimaginari part r is the invari subspac of k it complement is the infinit dimension open submanifold of
almost everywher equival class of integr function whose kimaginari project is not null
now everi dynam system st in particular those of the class f of k on h induc anoth dynam system
ut on v by set
ut st
38
consid the class f induc by f we conclud that k is a complex timerevers so we have anoth exampl
lack time orient but have a timerevers structur
in both classic and quantum statist mechan we have use the same criterium to choos n and h respect the densiti of the two theori are relat by the wigner integr w which is an essenti ingredi in the
theori of the classic limit 5 in the one dimension case it is the map w given by

where q is the spatial posit coordin 3 p it conjug momentum q p a classic densiti function and

we want to emphas the necess of have an homogen configur space r in the one dimension case in order
to have the translat q q in w integr

and therefor w is a morphism between l1 h k

and l1r t n k
h koopman treatment of kolmogorovsystem
with the definit of timerevers in the physic exampl abov we now face the same definit in pure
mathemat dynam system
let m st be a kolmogorov system cascad or flow as it is well known thi impli that the induc unitari
evolut ut in h 1 the orthogon complement of the one dimension subspac of the class a e of the
constant function in the hilbert space l2 m ha uniform lebesgu spectrum of numer constant multipl
thi in turn impli the exist of a system of imprimit es sg base on g for the group ut tg where g

then

44
t is selfadjoint in the discret case and essenti selfadjoint in the continu case and there are eigenvector

b the baker transform
we will show the geometr mean of the last two timerevers for the baker transform
the measur space is the toru
m 0 1 0 1 x y mod 1 x y x y 0 1
that is to say is the equival relat that identifi the follow boundari point
0 x 1 x and x 0 x 1
with it lebesgu measur the automorph s act as follow
sx y
if 0 x 12 0 y 1
2x 12 y

2x 1 2 y 2 if 12 x 1 0 y 1
58
it clear that s is a noncontinu but measur preserv transform which involv a contract in the y
direct and a dilat in the x direct the contract and dilat direct at everi point m m that is
the vertic and the horizont line through each m
the toru is a compact connect lie group and we can defin an involut automorph k on m by put
10
kx y y x x y i 0 1
59
the fix point of k constitut a submanifold of the toru the project of the diagon of the unit squar
i i
n x x x i
then
k s t k s t t z
60
in fact the first applic of k to the gener partit of s rotat the unit squar interchang the x
fiber with the y one then by applic s t that is t time s we get a stripe pattern of horizont line which is
rotat and yield a stripe pattern of vertic line when k is applic again the same pattern would be obtain
if s t wa use

61
is an isomorph mod 0 moreov it is an isomorph of abstract timerevers system becaus it send the
timerevers of 59 in the timerevers of 55 in particular thi impli that the baker map is a kolmogorov
system and therefor have the correspond timerevers for it koopman treatment these three revers are
relat
let a b be the partit of the unit squar into it left and right halv as it is well known thi partit is
both independ and gener for the baker map let defin

62
where a is the characterist function of the set a as well as
n u n 0 0 s n
1 in s n a

63
and for ani finit set f n1 nf z put
f n1 nf ordinari product of function
64
then all the eigenvector of the age oper t of u are of the form 20
t f n m f
65
where nm max f geometr speak 0 that we can identifi with a b is an eigenvector of age 0 and
if u act n time on it we get an eigenvector of age n n which can be identifi with a set of horizont fring
on the other hand if u 1 act n time on it we get an eigenvector of age n n which can be identifi with a set
of vertic fring as expect the induc action of k send the futur horizont eigenst of t to the past
vertic one and reciproc
