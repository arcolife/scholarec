introduct
the goal of combinatori chemistri is to find composit of matter that maxim a specif
materi properti when combinatori chemistri is appli to materi discoveri the desir
properti may be superconduct magnetoresist luminesc ligand specif sensor respons or catalyt activ when combinatori chemistri is appli to protein the desir
properti may be enzymat activ fluoresc antibiot resist or substrat bind specif in either case the properti to be optim the figur of merit is gener an unknown
function of the variabl and can be measur onli experiment
combinatori chemistri is then a search over a multidimension space of composit and
noncomposit variabl for region of high figur of merit a tradit synthet chemist would
carri out thi search by use chemic intuit to synthes a few initi molecul of these
molecul those that have a favor figur of merit would be identifi a homolog seri
of compound similar to those best start point would then be synthes final of the
compound in these homolog seri that with the best figur of merit would be identifi as the
optim materi
if the space of composit and noncomposit variabl is suffici larg novel or unfamiliar the tradit synthet approach may lead to the identif of materi that are not
truli the best it is in thi case that combinatori chemistri becom use in combinatori
chemistri trial librari of molecul are synthes instead of trial molecul by synthes
and screen for figur of merit an entir librari of 102 105 molecul instead of a singl molecul
the variabl space can be search much more thoroughli in thi sens combinatori chemistri
is a natur extens of tradit chemic synthesi intuit determin of the individu
molecul to synthes is replac by method for design of the molecular librari likewis
synthesi of homolog compound is replac by redesign of the librari for multipl round of
parallel screen experi
while the combinatori approach attempt to search composit space broadli an exhaust
search is usual not possibl it would take for exampl a librari of 9 106 compound to search
a fivecompon system at a mole fraction resolut of 1 similarli it would take a librari
of 20100 10130 protein to search exhaust the space of all 100 aminoacid protein domain
clearli a signific aspect to the design of a combinatori chemistri experi is the design
of the librari the librari member should be chosen so as to search the space of variabl as
effect as possibl given the experiment constraint on the librari size
the task of search composit space in combinatori chemistri for region of high figur
of merit is veri similar to the task of search configur space by mont carlo comput
simul for region of low free energi the space search by mont carlo comput simul
is often extrem larg with 104 or more continu dimens yet with recent advanc in the
design of mont carlo algorithm one is abl to locat reliabl the region of low free energi even
for fairli complic molecular system
thi chapter pursu the analog between combinatori chemistri and mont carlo comput
simul exampl of how to design librari for both materi discoveri and protein molecular evolut will be given for materi discoveri the concept of librari redesign or the use
previou experi to guid the design of new experi will be introduc for molecular
evolut exampl of how to use bias mont carlo to search the protein sequenc space will
be given chemic inform whether intuit theoret calcul or databas statist
can be natur incorpor as an a priori bia in the mont carlo approach to librari design in
combinatori chemistri in thi sens combinatori chemistri can be view as an extens of
tradit chemic synthesi

materi discoveri
a varieti of materi have been optim or develop to date by combinatori method
perhap the first experi to gather great attent wa the demonstr that inorgan oxid
hightc superconductor could be identifi by combinatori method xiang et al 1995 by
search sever 128member librari of differ inorgan oxid system the known composit
of superconduct bisrcacuo and ybacuo were identifi sinc then mani demonstr of
find known materi and discoveri of new materi have appear known composit of
giant magnetoresist materi have been identifi in librari of variou cobalt oxid brice
no
et al 1995 blue and red phosphor have been identifi from larg librari of 25000 differ
inorgan oxid danielson et al 1997 danielson et al 1988 wang et al 1998 polymerbas
sensor for variou organ vapor have been identifi by combinatori method dickinson and
walt 1997 catalyst for the oxid of co to co2 have been identifi by search ternari
compound of pd pt and rh or rh pd and cu weinberg et al 1998 cong et al 1999
phase diagram of zeolit materi have been map out by a combinatori multiautoclav
akporiay et al 1998 novel enantioselect catalyst have been found by search librari of
transit metalpeptid complex cole et al 1996 novel phosphatas catalyst were found by
search librari of carboxyl acidfunction polyallylamin polym menger et al 1995
new catalyst and condit for ch insert have been found by screen of ligandtransit
metal system burgess et al 1996 a new catalyst for the convers of methanol in a direct
methanol fuel cell wa identifi by search the quaternari composit space of pt ir os and
ru reddington et al 1998 final a novel thinfilm highdielectr compound that may be use
in futur gener of dram chip wa identifi by search through over 30 multicompon
ternari oxid system van dover et al 1998
the task of identifi the optim compound in a materi discoveri experi can be
reformul as one of search a multidimension space with the materi composit impur
level and synthesi condit as variabl present approach to combinatori librari design
and screen invari perform a grid search in composit space follow by a steepestasc
maxim of the figur of merit thi procedur becom ineffici in highdimension space
or when the figur of merit is not a smooth function of the variabl inde the use of a grid
search is what ha limit essenti all current combinatori chemistri experi to quaternari
compound ie to search a space with three variabl what is need is an autom yet more
effici procedur for search composit space
an analog with the comput simul techniqu of mont carlo allow us to design just
such an effici protocol for search the variabl space falcioni and deem 2000 in materi
discoveri a search is made through the composit and noncomposit variabl to find good
figureofmerit valu in mont carlo a search is made through configur space to find region
of low free energi by use insight gain from the design of mont carlo method the search in
materi discoveri can be improv
a
the space of variabl
sever variabl can be manipul in order to seek the materi with the optim figur of
merit materi composit is certainli a variabl but also film thick van dover et al 1998
and deposit method novet et al 1995 are variabl for materi made in thin film form the
process histori such as temperatur pressur ph and atmospher composit is a variabl
the guest composit or impur level can greatli affect the figur of merit cong et al 1999
in addit the crystallin of the materi can affect the observ figur of merit van dover
4
et al 1998 final the method of nucleat or synthesi may affect the phase or morpholog of
the materi and so affect the figur of merit helmkamp and davi 1995 zone et al 1998
there are import point to note about these variabl first a small impur composit
can caus a big chang in the figur of merit as seen by the rapid variat of catalyt activ in
the curh oxid catalyst cong et al 1999 second the phase in thin film are not necessarili
the same as those in bulk as seen in the case of the thinfilm dielectr where the optim materi
wa found outsid the region where the bulk phase form van dover et al 1998 final the
crystallin of the materi can affect the observ figur of merit again as seen in the thinfilm
dielectr exampl van dover et al 1998
b
librari design and redesign
the experiment challeng in combinatori chemistri appear to lie mainli in the screen
method and in the technolog for the creation of the librari the theoret challeng on the
other hand appear to lie mainli in the librari design and redesign strategi it is thi second
question that is address by the analog with mont carlo comput simul
combinatori chemistri differ from usual mont carlo simul in that sever simultan search of the variabl space are carri out that is in a typic combinatori chemistri
experi sever sampl eg 10000 are synthes and screen for figur of merit at one time
with the result of thi first round a new set of sampl can be synthes and screen thi
procedur can be repeat for sever round although current materi discoveri experi
have not systemat exploit thi featur
pursu the analog with mont carlo each round of combinatori chemistri correspond to
a move in a mont carlo simul instead of track one system with mani configur
degre of freedom howev mani sampl are track each with sever composit and noncomposit degre of freedom modern experiment technolog is what allow for the costeffect synthesi and screen of multipl sampl composit
the technolog for materi discoveri is still in the development stage and futur progress
can still be influenc by theoret consider in thi spirit i assum that the composit and
noncomposit variabl of each sampl can be chang independ as in spatial address
librari akporiay et al 1998 pirrung 1997 thi is signific becaus it allow great flexibl
in how the space can be search with a limit number of experiment sampl
current experi uniformli tend to perform a grid search on the composit and noncomposit variabl it is prefer howev to choos the variabl statist from the
allow valu it is also possibl to consid choos the variabl in a fashion that attempt to
maxim the amount of inform gain from the limit number of sampl screen via a
quasirandom lowdiscrep sequenc niederreit 1992 bratley et al 1994 such sequenc
attempt to elimin the redund that natur occur when a space is search statist
and they have sever favor theoret properti an illustr of these three approach to
materi discoveri librari design is shown in figur 1
inform about the figureofmerit landscap in the composit and noncomposit variabl can be incorpor by multipl round of screen one conveni way to incorpor thi
feedback as the experi proce is by treat the combinatori chemistri experi as a
mont carlo in the laboratori thi approach lead to sampl the experiment figur of merit
e proport to exp if is larg then the mont carlo procedur will seek out valu of
the composit and noncomposit variabl that maxim the figur of merit if is too larg
howev the mont carlo procedur will get stuck in rel lowli local maxima the first
round is initi by choos the composit and noncomposit variabl statist from the

figur 1 shown are the grid random and lowdiscrep sequenc approach to design the
first librari in a materi discoveri experi with three composit variabl the random
approach break the regular pattern of the grid search and the lowdiscrep sequenc approach
avoid overlap point that may aris in the random approach
allow valu the variabl are chang in succeed round as dictat by the mont carlo
procedur
sever gener featur of the method for chang the variabl can be enumer the statist method of chang the variabl can be bias by concern such as materi cost theoret
or experiment a priori insight into how the figur of merit is like to chang and patent
both the composit and noncomposit variabl will be chang in each round like it
would be desir to have a rang of move size for both type of variabl the characterist
move size would like best be determin by fix the accept ratio of the move as is customari in mont carlo simul frenkel and smit 1996 in addit there would like be a
smallest variabl chang that would be signific due to experiment resolut limit in the
screen step final a steepestasc optim to find the best local optima of the figur
of merit would like be benefici at the end of a materi discoveri experi driven by such a
mont carlo strategi
c
search the variabl space by mont carlo
two way of chang the variabl are consid a small random chang of the variabl of
a randomli chosen sampl and a swap of a subset of the variabl between two randomli chosen
sampl swap is use when there is a hierarch structur to the variabl the swap
event allow for the combin of benefici subset of variabl between differ sampl for
exampl a good set of composit variabl might be combin with a particularli good impur
composit or a good set of composit variabl might be combin with a good set of
process variabl these move are repeat until all the sampl in a round have been modifi
the valu of the figur of merit for the propos new sampl are then measur whether to
accept the newli propos sampl or to keep the current sampl for the next round is decid

signific of sampl
sampl the figur of merit by mont carlo rather than global optim by some other
method is favor for sever reason first mont carlo is an effect stochast optim
method second simpl global optim may be mislead sinc concern such as patent
cost of materi and eas of synthesi are not usual includ in the experiment figur of merit
moreov the screen that is most easili perform in the laboratori the primari screen is
usual onli roughli correl with the true figur of merit inde after find materi that
look promis base upon the primari screen experiment secondari and tertiari screen are
usual perform to identifi that materi which is truli optim third it might be advantag
to screen for sever figur of merit at onc for exampl it might be profit to search for
reactant and condit that lead to the synthesi of sever zeolit with a particularli favor
properti such as the presenc of a larg pore as anoth exampl it might be use to search for
sever electrocatalyst that all possess a use properti such as be abl to serv as the anod
or cathod materi in a particular fuel cell
for all of these reason sampl by mont carlo to produc sever candid materi is
prefer over global optim

the random phase volum model
the ultim test of new theoreticallymotiv protocol for materi discoveri is of cours
experiment in order to motiv such experiment the effect of these protocol is
demonstr by combinatori chemistri experi where the experiment screen step is
replac by figur of merit return by the random phase volum model the random phase
volum model is not fundament to the protocol it is introduc as a simpl way to test parameter and valid the variou search method
the random phase volum model relat the figur of merit to the composit and noncomposit variabl in a statist way the model is fast enough to allow for valid of the
propos search method on an enorm number of sampl yet possess the correct statist
for the figureofmerit landscap
the composit mole fraction are nonneg and sum to uniti and so the allow composit are constrain to lie within a simplex in d 1 dimens for the familiar ternari system
thi simplex is an equilater triangl as shown in figur 3b typic sever phase will exist
for differ composit of the materi the figur of merit will be dramat differ between each of these distinct phase to mimic thi expect behavior the composit variabl are

effect of the mont carlo strategi
the figur of merit found by the protocol are shown in figur 5 the singleround protocol
random and lowdiscrep sequenc find better solut than doe grid in one round of experi interestingli the lowdiscrep sequenc approach fare no better than doe random
despit the desir theoret properti of lowdiscrep sequenc

thi feedback mechan prove to be effect even for the rel small total sampl size of
100000 consid here it is expect that the advantag of the mont carlo method will becom
even greater for larger sampl size note that in case such as catalyt activ sensor respons or
ligand specif the experiment figur of merit would like be exponenti in the valu shown
in figur 5 so that the success of the mont carlo method would be even more dramat a

protein molecular evolut
the space to be search in protein combinatori chemistri experi is extrem larg
consid for exampl that a rel short 100 amino acid protein domain were to be evolv
the number of possibl amino acid sequenc of thi length is 20100 10130 sinc there are 20
natur occur amino acid residu clearli all of these sequenc cannot be synthes and
then screen for figur of merit in the laboratori some mean must be found for search thi
space with the 104 or so protein than can be screen per day experiment
a hierarch decomposit of the protein space can provid an effect search procedur
it is known from protein structur biolog that protein are encod by dna sequenc dna
sequenc code for amino acid amino acid arrang into secondari structur secondari structur
arrang into domain domain group to form protein monom and protein monom aggreg
to form multiprotein complex by sampl on each level of thi hierarchi one is abl to search
the sequenc space much more effect in thi chapter search strategi make use of the dna
14
amino acid and secondari structur hierarchi will be describ with thi approach function
protein space ha a larg yet manag number of dimens that is in a 100 amino acid
protein domain there are approxim 10 secondari structur of 5 type helic loop strand
turn and other roughli yield the potenti for 107 basic protein fold organ into
secondari structur class repres a dramat reduct in the complex of sequenc space
sinc there are 10170 differ dna sequenc and 10130 differ amino acid sequenc in thi
space
sampl on the differ level of protein structur is analog to combin of differ
move type in a mont carlo simul a varieti of move from small local move to larg
global move are often incorpor in the most success mont carlo simul while protein
molecular evolut is carri out in the laboratori and mont carlo simul are carri out
in silico the parallel are strike one of the most power new concept in mont carlo is the
idea that move should be bias frenkel and smit 1996 that is small move such as the
metropoli method sampl configur space rather slowli larger move are prefer sinc
they sampl the space more rapidli larg move are usual reject howev sinc they often
lead the system into a region of high energi so that the larg move will be more success a
bia toward region that look promis is includ such bias mont carlo simul have
been a factor of 105 to 1010 time more effici than previou method and they have allow the
examin of system previous uncharacteriz by molecular simul techniqu frenkel
et al 1992 frenkel and smit 1992 de pablo et al 1992 smit and maesen 1995
in thi section the possibl of evolv protein molecul by strategi similar to bias mont
carlo will be explor the larg move of mont carlo are implement by chang an evolv
protein at the secondari structur level these evolutionari event will be bias in that the
amino acid sequenc insert will be chosen so that they code for viabl secondari structur
the concept of bia also appli at the amino acid level where differ dna sequenc code for
the same amino acid can lead to differ propens for futur evolut
a
what is protein molecular evolut
protein molecular evolut can be view as combinatori chemistri of protein sinc protein
sequenc space is so larg most experi to date have sought to search onli small region a
typic experi seek to optim the figur of merit of an exist protein for exampl an
improv in the select or activ of an enzym might be sought altern an expans
in the oper rang of an enzym might be sought to higher temperatur or pressur thi
improv would be achiev by chang or evolv the amino acid sequenc of the enzym
a more ambiti goal would be the ab initio evolut of a protein with a specif function
that is noth would be known about the desir molecul except that it should be a protein
and that an experiment screen for the desir figur of merit is avail one might want
for exampl an enzym that catalyz an unusu reaction or one might want a protein that
bind a specif substrat or one might want a protein with an unusu fluoresc spectrum
the ab initio evolut of a protein ha never been accomplish befor such a feat would be
remark natur biolog divers ha evolv despit the essenti infinit complex of
protein sequenc replic of thi feat in the laboratori would repres substanti progress
and mimick thi feat of natur is a current goal in the molecular evolut field inde the
protocol describ in thi section are craft with just thi task in mind
a still more ambiti goal would be the evolut of a multiprotein complex thi is a rather
challeng task due to the increas complex of the space to be search the task can be made
manag by ask a rather gener evolutionari question one can seek to evolv for exampl
15
a multiprotein complex that can serv as the coat protein complex for a viru sinc there are
mani protein that may accomplish thi task thi evolutionari task may not be as specif and
difficult as it might seem at first
the most ambiti goal for laboratori evolut that ha been imagin is the evolut of
new life form evolut on thi scale requir chang not onli at the secondari structur scale
but also at the domain protein and protein pathway scale due to their simplic virus or
phage would be the most like target of such largescal evolut attempt it is unclear how
new life form would be distribut in term of pathogen and so such experi should be
approach with caution
the hierarch decomposit of sequenc space will allow effect molecular evolut if
there are mani protein with a high valu of ani particular figur of merit that is if onli one
out of 10130 small protein domain exhibit a high score on a particular figur of merit thi protein
is unlik to be identifi on the other hand if mani protein score highli on the figur of
merit onli a subset of these molecul need be sampl thi same issu aris in convent
mont carlo simul sampl all of configur space is never possibl in a simul
yet ensembl averag and experiment behavior can be reproduc by sampl repres
configur that life on our planet ha evolv suggest that there is a great redund in
protein space kauffman 1993 and so one may hope to search thi space experiment with
suffici power move
b
background on experiment molecular evolut
there are some constraint on molecular evolut as it is carri out in the laboratori there
are constraint aris from limit of molecular biolog ie onli certain type of move are
possibl on the dna that code for the protein there are also constraint aris from technic
limit ie onli a certain number of protein can be screen for figur of merit in a day
exist approach to the evolut of gener protein are essenti limit to chang at the
singl base level somewhat more sophist method are avail for evolut of antibodi
but thi is a special case that will not be consid here the first type of evolutionari chang that
is possibl in the laboratori is a base substitut base substitut are natur made as dna
is copi or amplifi by pcr the rate at which base substitut or mistak in the copi
of the templat dna are made can be adjust by vari experiment condit such as the
manganes and magnesium ion concentr it is import to note that these base substitut
are made without knowledg of the dna sequenc of the evolv protein equal import is
that these base substitut are made without the use of a chemic synthes these chang
are made natur within the context of effici molecular biolog method anoth mean of
modifi an exist protein is to use random or direct mutagenesi to chang specif dna
base so that they code for random or specifi amino acid the approach requir both that
the dna sequenc be known and that it subsequ be synthes by chemic mean such a
labori approach is not practic in highthroughput evolut experi where typic 104
protein are simultan modifi and evolv per day
sinc the averag length of a human gene is roughli 1800 base basebybas point mutat
will achiev signific evolut onli veri slowli more significantli the figureofmerit landscap
for protein function is typic quit rug base mutat therefor invari ceas evolut
at a local optima of the figur of merit base mutat can be view as an experiment method
for local optim of protein figur of merit
much of the current enthusiasm for protein molecular evolut is due to the discoveri of dna
shuffl by pim stemmer in 1994 stemmer 1994 dna shuffl is a method for evolv an

wa a case of famili shuffl crameri et al 1998 so most of these chang were between
homolog amino acid
exist protein to achiev a higher figur of merit the great geniu of stemmer wa to develop
a method for combin benefici base mutat that is natur accomplish with the tool of
molecular biolog and that doe not requir dna sequenc or chemic synthesi the method is
success becaus combin of base mutat that were individu benefici is like to lead
to an even higher figur of merit than is achiev by either mutat alon of cours thi will not
alway be true but the extent to which it is true is the extent to which dna shuffl will be an
effect techniqu dna shuffl combin with base mutat is the current state of the art
experiment techniqu for protein molecular evolut
tabl 2 list a few of the protein system that have been evolv by the stemmer group
evid dna shuffl is highli effect at improv the function of an exist protein much
more effect than is simpl base mutat the specif of an enzym can even be alter as in
the convers of a galactosidas into a fucosidas a rough median of the improv factor
is about 100 most import howev is that all of these improv were achiev with a
rel small number of amino acid chang on averag onli 6 amino acid were alter out
of roughli 400 total residu in the protein as with base mutat then dna shuffl is abl
to search sequenc space onli local after a small number of amino acid chang dna shuffl
produc a protein with a local rather than global optim figur of merit
the current state of the art experiment techniqu for protein molecular evolut can be
view as local optim procedur in protein sequenc space altern they can be
17
view as experiment implement of simpl or metropoli mont carlo procedur by use
our intuit regard the design of power bias mont carlo algorithm we can develop more
power experiment protocol for molecular evolut
interestingli theoret treatment of evolut whether in natur or in the laboratori tend to
consid onli the effect of point mutat kauffman 1993 volkenstein 1994 inde interest
theori regard the evolutionari potenti of point mutat have been develop as shown
experiment howev point mutat is incap of significantli evolv protein at substanti
rate even the more power techniqu of dna shuffl search protein space mere local
onli with the inclus of more dramat move such as chang at the level of secondari structur
can protein space be search more thoroughli
c
the gener nk model
in order to valid the molecular evolut protocol to be present a model that relat amino
acid sequenc to protein function is need of cours the real test of these protocol should be
experiment and i hope that these experi will be forthcom in order to stimul interest
in the propos protocol their effect will be simul on a model of protein function
such a model would seem to be difficult to construct it is extrem difficult to determin the
threedimension structur of a protein given the amino acid sequenc moreov it is extrem
difficult to calcul ani of the typic figur of merit given the threedimension structur of a
protein
it is fortun that a model that relat figur of merit to amino acid sequenc for a specif
protein is not need the requir is simpli a model that produc figureofmerit landscap
in sequenc space that are analog to those that would be measur in the laboratori on an
ensembl of protein thi type of model is easier to construct and a random energi model can
be use to accomplish the task
the gener nk model is just such a random energi model the nk model wa first
introduc in order to model combinatori chemistri experi on peptid kauffman and
levin 1987 kauffman 1993 kauffman and macreadi 1995 it wa subsequ gener
to account for secondari structur in real protein perelson and macken 1995 the model wa
further gener to account for interact between the secondari structur and for the presenc
of a bind pocket bogarad and deem 1999
thi gener nk model assign a uniqu figur of merit to each evolv protein sequenc
thi model while a simplifi descript of real protein captur much of the thermodynam
of protein fold and ligand bind the model take into account the format of secondari
structur via the interact of amino acid side chain as well as the interact between secondari
structur within protein in addit for specif the figur of merit is assum to be a
bind constant and so the model includ a contribut repres bind to a substrat
the combin abil to fold and bind substrat is what will be optim or evolv that is the
direct of the protein evolut will be base upon the figur of merit return by thi gener
nk model thi gener nk model contain sever paramet and a reason determin
of these paramet is what allow the model to compar success with experi

a typic protein evolut experi start with an initi protein sequenc thi sequenc is
then copi to a larg number of ident sequenc all of these sequenc are evolv or mutat
in parallel after one round of mutat event the protein are screen for figur of merit thi
screen step is typic the rate limit step and so the effici of thi step determin how
mani protein can be evolv in parallel for typic figur of merit 10000 protein can be screen
in a day if select that is use of a screen base upon whether an organ live or die were
19
perform instead 109 1015 protein could be screen in a day select is a special case
howev and so the more conserv case of screen 10000 protein per day is consid
after the screen the protein are rank accord to their measur valu of the figur of
merit typic the top x percent of the sequenc are kept for the next round of mutat the
paramet x is to be adjust experiment in the simul evolut the valu of x 10
wa alway found to be optim other method for select the protein to keep for the next
round have been consid for exampl keep protein proport to expu ha been
consid thi strategi seem to work less well than the top x percent method the main reason
seem to be that in the top x percent method the criterion for select which sequenc to keep
adjust natur with the rang of figur of merit found in the evolv sequenc after the top
x percent sequenc are select they are copi back up to a total of 10000 sequenc these
sequenc are the input for the next round of mutat and select
in the simul molecular evolut the experi is continu for 100 round thi is a
rel larg number of round to carri out experiment with the most power protocol

hope that the search of larg region of protein space appar possibl with these method will

defin which is the probabl per replic that a base chang lead to a nonconserv
mutat the conserv and nonconserv mutat probabl can be view as defin
the evolutionari potenti of each codon codon with high conserv and nonconserv
mutat rate can be said to exhibit a high evolutionari potenti these mutat tendenc
are shown in figur 9 in gener amino acid that exhibit a dramat function properti such
as the charg residu the ring residu cystein and tryptophan tend to mutat at higher
nonconserv rate that allow for the possibl delet of the properti amino acid that are
more gener such as the polar neutral residu and the nonpolar nonring residu tend to
mutat at higher conserv rate that allow sequenc space to be search for similar favor

there is a connect between condon usag and dna shuffl in the most success dna
shuffl experi by the stemmer group codon assign of the initi code sequenc are
optim for express thi assign typic increas the nonsynonym mutat rate

the creation of the primari antibodi repertoir in vertebr is anoth exampl of dna swap

conclud remark on molecular evolut
dna base substitut in the context of the genet code is ideal suit for the gener
diversif and optim of local protein space miller and orgel 1974 maeshiro and
kimura 1998 howev the difficulti of make the transit from one product tertiari
fold to anoth limit evolut via base substitut and homolog recombin alon nonhomolog dna recombin rearrang and insert allow for the combinatori creation
of product tertiari fold via the novel combin of suitabl structur inde effici search
of the highdimension fold space requir a hierarch rang of mutat event
thi section ha address from a theoret point of view the question of how protein space can
be search effici and thoroughli either in the laboratori or in natur it wa shown that point
mutat alon is incap of evolv system with substanti new protein fold it wa further
demonstr that even the dna shuffl approach is incap of evolv substanti new
protein fold the mont carlo simul demonstr that nonhomolog dna swap
of low energi structur is a key step in search protein space
more gener the simul demonstr that the effici search of larg region of protein
space requir a hierarchi of genet event each encod higher order structur substitut it
wa shown how the complex protein function landscap can be navig with these move it wa
conclud that analog move have driven the evolut of protein divers found in natur the
propos move which appear to be experiment feasibl would make an interest addit to

a wide varieti of pest organ and parasit includ fungi weed insect protozoan
macroparasit and bacteria have use evolutionari process to evad chemic control the
rang of evolutionari event exhibit by these organ is similar in spirit to the hierarchi of
move present in the molecular evolut protocol see figur 6 bacteria provid one of the most
press exampl of the problem pose by an evolv diseas a move target although
there undoubtedli have been mani select pressur upon bacteria the novel pressur with the
largest impact in the last half centuri ha been the worldwid use of antibiot thi background
presenc of antibiot ha lead to the develop of antibiot resist in mani speci of
bacteria inde multidrug resist is now a major health care issu with some strain resist
to all but one or even all known antibiot
interestingli there is anoth strong pressur on evolv bacteria that of the vertebr immun system thi pressur is thought to be respons for mosaic or modular as a result of
swappingtyp event gene found in speci of bacteria not natur genet compet such
as e coli and s pyogen dowson et al 1997 in these case the longstand strong select
