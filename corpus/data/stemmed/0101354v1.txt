abstract we discuss singl charg higg boson product from e e annihil
at next gener linear collid they can be import to studi the phenomenolog of charg higg boson especi when charg higg boson are too heavi to
be produc by the pair product mechan cross section for variou singl product process are evalu at the lead order our analysi show that in some
paramet region the phenomenolog of charg higg boson can be explor even
beyond the kinemat limit for pair product by use singl product process
introduct
electroweak symmetri break sector which are compos of two scalar isospindoublet predict charg higg boson h their discoveri at futur collid will
directli indic such a nonminim structur of the higg sector and it detail
inform will give strong hint for the structr of physic beyond the standard
model sm therefor their phenomenolog ha been evalu especi over
the past few year as their discoveri potenti ha becom more clear
at cern larg hadron collid charg higg boson below the top quark mass
will be produc in the top quark decay process for heavier charg higg boson
they will be produc mainli through the subprocess gb th gg tbh and
their charg conjug and they may be probe for exampl use the decay
mode h and it charg conjug especi for larg tan valu in
spite of huge qcd background

on the other hand at futur electronpositron linear collid lc the domin product process should be the pair product 1 e e h h it
cross section depend onli on the charg higg mass and thi process provid
a hallmark channel through which we can studi h phenomenolog 2 as long
as the chargedhigg boson mass mh is suffici
smaller than it kinemat threshold s2 when mh is near or abov s2 the pair product is
not avail in such a case the phenomenolog of charg higg boson may be
explor through the kinematicallyallow singl product process
in thi talk we discuss variou singl h product channel to complement
the pair product channel we consid the follow process 3

the associ product mode 1 ha been studi in the literatur 4 the
process 2 6 7 and 8 as well as 5 with z bb lead to the same final
state bbw h 5 the oneloop induc process e e h w have also been
studi in ref 67 the oneloop induc hw z and hw vertic which enter
into 4 have been calcul in ref 8

in ref 3
the associ product process 1 shown in fig 1 are

the pair product as long as it is kinemat allow mh s2 abov
thi threshold the cross section still exceed 105 pb at larg tan valu if h is
heavi enough to decay into tb domin background contribut come from topquark pair product by peform w and t mass reconstruct the background

can be reduc naiv by oew
so that the signal would be visibl although
detail simul are need depend on each machin
the tb or tb associ product process 2 ha a similar structur to h
mode but the tan depend is opposit the rate is larger for smaller tan
valu the cross section is suppress abov the pair product threshold in
comparison with that of h mode becaus of the differ in the phase space
figur 2 show the cross section of the oneloop induc process e e
w h 3 for small tan valu the h tb coupl includ in each quarkloop diagram is larg so that the cross section becom substanti the tan
depend of the cross section is mt4 cot2 at small tan and m4b tan2 at
veri larg tan the cross section remain larg beyond the pair product kinemat limit when the domin h decay mode is tb we can deal with the top
pair background by reconstruct the final state and elimin event with two
top quark thi is expect to reduc the top pair background by about ew
which should enabl the observ of the peak at the charg higg mass in some
region of the paramet space
for the rest of the process 414 there is a varieti of structur observ in
the cross section their rate howev turn out to be veri small for larger mh
than the pair product threshold thi is owe to the reason such as coupl
suppress cancel between feynman diagram andor smaller phase space
detail of the numer result are shown in ref 3 as mention the process
2 5 6 7 and 8 lead
to the final state bbh w some channel have
larg cross section for mh s2 3 the varieti of reson structur impli
littl interfer among these process the e e bbh w mode therefor
complement the pair product in the charg higg studi at lc especi below
the threshold of the pair product 5 the procedur for the tag of the final
state bbh w is outlin in ref 3
in either process inform of the tau 9 and the top 10 polar can be
use to help identifi the charg higg boson
conclus
we found that the h channel and the loop induc h w channel are
the most promis channel for studi charg higg phenomenolog beyond
the kinemat limit for pair product the h w channel is enhanc at low
tan wherea the h channel is enhanc at larg tan for the charg
higg boson whose mass is below the pair product threshold some of the singl product channel which lead to the bbh w final state complement the
pair product some of their cross section becom larg but they are rapidli
suppress abov the kinemat limit of the pair product our result motiv
further studi of the decay mode the hadron final state and the background
relev to these charg higg boson singl product process
