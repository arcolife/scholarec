introduct
comput research reli heavili on the rapid dissemin of result as a result the formal
process of submit paper to journal ha been augment by other more rapid dissemin method origin these involv print document such as technic report and
confer paper with the advent of the internet research develop and began to use
a varieti of electron mean for rapid dissemin individu and organiz web site
made it possibl to provid cheap and almost instantan access to research result but
these resourc were fragment there wa no singl repositori to which research from the
whole field of comput could submit report no singl place to search for research result
and no guarante that inform would be archiv at the end of a research project
thi chang in septemb 1998 through a partnership of acm httpwwwacmorg
the lanl lo alamo nation lab eprint archiv httpxxxlanlgov and ncstrl
network comput scienc technic refer librari httpwwwncstrlorg an onlin
comput research repositori corr wa establish the repositori is avail to all
member of the commun at no charg they can submit paper brows and search paper
current on the repositori and subscrib to get notif of new submiss
in the rest of thi articl i briefli describ how corr wa set up and discuss some polici
issu

set up corr issu and decis
acm wa and continu to be interest in experi with differ approach to dissemin research in may 1997 a committe wa form under the auspic of the acm
thi articl is base on and borrow liber from two earlier articl a comput research repositori
dlib magazin novemb 1998 httpwwwdliborgdlibnovember9811halpernhtml and the comput
research repositori promot the rapid dissemin of comput scienc research proceed of acm
digit librari 99 1999 pp 311 the latter articl is joint with carl lagoz i thank him for all hi
contribut thi work wa support in part by the nsf under grant iri9625901

public board to consid one such chang set up an onlin repositori for comput
research1 initi the main focu of the committe discuss revolv around the design
of the architectur three main option emerg
the first option wa to becom part of the lanl repositori lanl start as a repositori
for highenergi physic eprint in 1991 sever year befor the introduct of the web it
pioneer the concept of an openaccess repositori for fast public of scientif research by
elimin the time consum and expens process of peer review it ha transform the
dissemin of research in sever disciplin it now cover most of physic and ha expand
to includ repositori for nonlinear scienc mathemat and comput and languag the
lanl archiv are sometim call a preprint servic and inde mani of the eprint are
subsequ publish in convent journal but they are intend as longterm archiv
with much greater perman than typic web site
as a base for a comput repositori lanl ha mani attract featur perhap the
most import is that it clearli work and work well it now ha over 100000 eprint is
grow at the rate of about 25000year handl over 100000 transactionsday and ha over
35000 user thank to fund from the depart of energi and the nation scienc
foundat it also ha a fulltim staff it is mirror in 15 countri ha reason search
facil and offer servic such as email notif of new submiss of interest
the acm committe decid against thi option primarili becaus the lanl interfac wa
not open in the sens that it did not provid an interfac to which other repositori could link
and wa not easili amen to extens and enhanc
the second option consid wa to becom a node in ncstrl ncstrl is essenti a
common interfac to the technic report collect of it current over 100 member institut it ha been fund by darpa and the nation scienc foundat with most of the
technic work recent be carri out at cornel univers the most import featur
of ncstrl from our point of view were that it wa explicitli design with an open interfac
and it wa a comput scienc effort on the other hand ncstrl did not have all the softwar
necessari for run a repositori
the third option wa to build a new system from scratch thi had the obviou advantag that we could design our own system which hope would have exactli the attribut
we requir but had the equal obviou disadvantag that it would take time money and
expertis
the committe settl on a hybrid approach that combin the best featur of lanl and
ncstrl and secur the cooper of the two group thi allow us to use the welltest
lanl softwar for submiss notif and search while still take advantag of the
ncstrl architectur the ncstrl architectur make it easi to build new gateway from
which to access the file with a more userfriendli interfac and new featur from the point
of view of the ncstrl interfac lanl is now just a node on ncstrl
we anticip then that our use of an open protocol would encourag other scholarli
archiv to join in thi framework result in a global multidisciplinari research collect that
could have substanti impact on the natur of scholarli publish some recent develop
have made that hope more like to becom realiti see section 3 and 4

with the major decis out of the way there were still a number of other import
decis that had to be made regard how corr would oper
how should corr be organ the physic and mathemat archiv at lanl are
organ into a rel small number of subject areas38 in the case of physic and
31 in the case of mathemat these subject area play a number of role from the
perspect of document submiss they form the basi for moder that is for each
subject area there is a moder who check submit paper for related to the
subject although not qualiti or novelti at the userinterfac level the subject class
are use as aid for search brows and subscrib
the committe had to decid how to partit the comput field into subject area one
choic wa to use the acm classif system see httpwwwacmorgclass1998overviewhtml
the acm classif scheme ha the advantag of be a rel stabl scheme that
cover all research in comput which ha been care craft over the year unfortun it doe not map too well to the current major area of academ comput scienc
in particular it seem difficult to find moder for subject area that correspond
to major topic under the acm classif system
in the end the committe chose to use both approach author are ask to classifi paper both by by choos a subject area from a list of subject area of which there are current 33 see httpxxxlanlgovarchivecssubjhtml for a descript of the area and
by choos a primari classif from among the roughli 100 thirdlevel head in the
1998 acm comput classif system see httpwwwacmorgclass1998overviewhtml
while the subject area are not mutual exclus nor do they yet provid complet
coverag of the field they seem to better reflect the activ area of research in cs each
subject area ha a moder while document are partit by subject area reader
can search and get notifi of new paper both by acm classif and subject area
we expect to add more subject area subdivid current subject area and perhap delet
subject area depend on demand over time interestingli the committe that form
the mathemat archiv at lanl chose not to use the am classif scheme at all instead opt for their own subject classif see httpxxxlanlgovnewmathhtml
notic it is author who choos subject area by use the lanl softwar we were
effect commit to the lanl approach for paper submiss the lanl philosophi is to have author do the submiss with as much autom as possibl author
send their document to the lanl repositori by email by ftp or by use web interfac
provid by lanl they are expect to provid their paper in specifi format provid
an abstract and to classifi their paper by subject area and acm class
what about copyright publish typic requir author to transfer copyright when
they publish a paper sinc it give them more freedom of action and more control of the
disposit of the paper the committe decid not to requir ani transfer of copyright
or public right author continu to retain copyright when they submit although
they may have to transfer right if they wish to publish in certain journal
how long should paper stay on corr the committe view corr as archiv the
expect is that paper submit will stay there perman thi doe not prevent
3
author from updat their paper updat version of a paper can be post at ani
time but version not remov or chang within 24 hour of submiss will remain on
the repositori as well all version are timestamp to avoid confus the most recent
version of a paper is the one access by default but there are pointer to the earlier
version thi prevent a situat where for exampl author a improv on the result
of an earli version of bs paper but find that these improv seem foolish when the
onli version of bs paper that is avail ha better result
what submiss format should be accept for mani year physicist have use tex
as the standard format for research paper becaus of the control that it provid for
repres mathemat therefor the lanl archiv provid excel support for
sever version of tex theoret comput scientist also use tex while postscript
ha been a favorit format for comput technic report current author can submit document to corr use texlatexamstex htmlgif pdf or postscript
howev if tex or one of it variant is avail it is strongli prefer to postscript
or pdf see httpxxxlanlgovhelpfaqwhytex for the reason if an author ha gener postscript or pdf from some variant of tex it will be reject in favor of the tex
sourc thi polici ha gener some controversi see section 3
what about preserv longterm preserv of document in corr is clearli a
seriou concern there are two orthogon aspect to thi issu one is the concern
that disk crash and other softwar and hardwar failur will caus the loss of mani
document the other involv chang platform the committe felt that lanl size
would prove to be a signific advantag in deal with both concern sinc lanl
ha 15 mirror site and perform frequent backup there should be more than enough
redund to deal with softwar and hardwar problem no one ha a definit answer
to the problem of platform chang but with so mani paper on lanl alreadi our hope
is that there will be enough pressur that whenev platform chang softwar will be
written to automat convert the file in corr to whatev platform is current just
as there is now softwar to convert postscript to pdf
who should particip in corr anyon can brows corr search for paper and
download paper the lanl softwar permit anyon from a univers govern
research lab or industri research lab to submit paper it assum that anyon come
from a edu domain is from a univers the softwar recogn the domain name of the
major govern and industri research lab other may also submit upon request
with some minim argument that they are engag in research thi filter wa put in
place to make it easier to reject crackpot physic paper it made sens when the
lanl archiv consist onli of physic paper especi becaus it is rel easi to
character the place where research in physic is carri out thi is not quit as easi
for comput scienc corr is certainli not intend to be exclus and we may have to
revisit thi issu at some point but so far it seem not to have been a problem there have
been veri few request to submit paper to corr that have come from nonrecogn
domain and no one who ha want to submit to corr ha been prevent from do
so

issu rais through experi
corr ha been in oper sinc sept 15 1998 after an initi flurri of over submiss the
recent rate ha been slightli under one submiss a day current there are about 1800 paper
on corr with about 900 come from a previouslyexist archiv at lanl on comput
and languag which ha now been fold into corr these are combin through the ncstrl
interfac with over 27000 other paper it is too earli to tell whether corr will realli catch
on howev a number of group have tent plan to migrat archiv to corr and to use
corr as a repositori for journal and confer activ the prognosi seem good
a number of issu have arisen in the first year of oper which i briefli discuss here
insist on sourc file there have been bitter complaint from user about the
insist on tex sourc there seem to be two orthogon reason for these complaint
the first involv eas of submiss there is no question that it much easier to submit a
singl postscript file than it is to submit a tex file and a number of auxiliari file such as
figur in postscript a bibliographi file and macro file note that lanl automat
reject tex file that do not includ all the necessari auxiliari file point out which
file are miss a script ha recent been post on corr that automat collect
all the relev file spare author the burden of do so thu mitig thi concern
the second reason is that author are concern with the fact that sourc file are avail
for download although in fact they are rare downloadedread far prefer postscript
or pdf author are concern that the avail of the sourc will make plagiar
easier and also give reader access to comment that were intend to be privat there
is a script avail at corr that will strip comment from file author also now have
the option of make their sourc unavail to reader although corr will still retain
the sourc so as to be abl to use it to convert to new format as they aris the advisori
committe encourag author to make the sourc freeli avail one never know what
other use for the sourc will be found in the futur in ani case it is certainli possibl to
plagiar even from postscript given the avail of postscript to ascii convert
it is interest to note that the physic commun which presum ha much the
same concern as the comput commun ha been submit tex sourc file to
lanl for year thi suggest that there may be cultur differ between the commun perhap in time the comput commun will also becom more comfort
with submit sourc file
user interfac there have been mani legitim complaint about the user interfac
at corr and more gener at lanl anecdot evid suggest that submit
a paper for the first time can easili take over 45 minut and be a veri frustrat
experi thing certainli go much faster and more smoothli with experi and the
new tool introduc for tex submiss should help but there is no question that the
user interfac could stand improv howev design a good user interfac take
time and energi and corr is a volunt effort i hope and expect that over time a better
interfac will be develop or interfacesth open architectur make it straightforward
to access corr through variou gateway each of which could have their own interfac

fund current corr is ride on the coattail of nsf and darpa fund provid
to lanl and ncstrl and thi should suffic for the forese futur the longrun
fund situat is not yet clear in ani case provid the basic repositori servic doe
not seem to be an expens proposit of cours new develop can be expens
but we should be abl to take advantag of work done by other project so it may not be
not be necessari to do too much develop inhous clearli when a resourc becom
as import to a commun as the lanl archiv are to physicist and i hope that
corr will be to comput scientist that commun will collect work to ensur
fund howev the econom model for electron scholarli publish and for the
internet as a whole are still the subject of consider investig it is not clear how
the fund issu will be resolv in the long run
journal public there are field such as medicin and chemistri for which publish
will not publish paper that have appear on the web even on an author person web
site thi seem to be easier to do in case where one or two journal domin a
field it is harder in field where there are mani smaller journal without one domin
one in particular it ha not been the case in comput scienc and is unlik to
becom so research have come to expect that they will be abl to make their paper
avail rapidli at onlin site such as corr while still submit their paper to
convent journal publish may insist as part of their copyright polici that a
paper be withdrawn as a precondit to journal public in thi case at the author
request the paper will inde be withdrawn howev thi doe not seem like to be a
problem in comput scienc all the major publish i have check with so far acm
ieee siam elsevi academ press and springer allow author to post post final
version of their paper on the person web page and preprint on public repositori
such as corr and do not requir preprint to be withdrawn societi publish acm
ieee and siam also allow author to post final journal version of their paper on
corr with proper copyright notice2 in the case of acm thi is a twoyear experi
acm is examin the impact that thi will have on journal sale i hope and expect that
the polici will be continu after the twoyear experiment period as a result of
negoti with the editori board of artifici intellig elsevi is allow final
version of paper that appear in that journal to appear on corr elsevi appar
doe not allow thi for other journal even in the biolog and medic scienc
there are indic that thing may chang with the advent of pubm central see
httpwwwnihgovwelcomedirectorpubmedcentralpubmedcentralhtm
4
where do we go from here
thi is a period of chang in scholarli publish and nobodi can predict the chang that
will happen over the next few year the impact of corr and similar effort on convent
journal is no doubt a question that mani journal publish are ask there are a number of possibl in one scenario eprint repositori such as corr could coexist with the
2
corr allow author to indic where paper have been publish and add link to publish digit
librari
6
convent journal model recogn that that model will undoubtedli move to electron
dissemin for exampl lanl ha been provid eprint archiv in physic sinc 1991
without appar impact on convent journal in anoth scenario effort such as corr
could be the primari repositori for journal paper while provid the foundat for a new
and enhanc role for convent publish
a barebon journal could be built that would simpli be a collect of pointer to document in corr and other feder repositori the journal would have an editori board
just as journal do now paper would be peer review in the usual way rather than or
in addit to come out in print onc a paper wa accept the final version would be
deposit in corr and there would be a pointer to it from the journal web site there
current is one such overlay journal in physic advanc in theoret and mathemat
physic httpwwwintlpresscomjournalsamtp in comput scienc the journal of artifici intellig research httpwwwcswashingtoneduresearchjair is also plan a
similar move publish could provid valu ad servic to author and reader such as
summar servic advanc search tool awar and filter servic that build
on the content in corrlik repositori clearli if effort such as corr develop into the primari vehicl for dissemin of research result they could significantli chang the busi
model for scholarli public
the structur of corr make it possibl to experi with other way of filter paper
besid tradit peer review one approach that ha often been suggest is that of have
a comment facil certainli a comment facil could be ad either in corr itself or in an
overlay site such comment facil have met with mix success in the past for exampl
there ha been littl usag of the comment facil provid by the journal of artifici intellig research the comment facil at the electron transact on artifici intellig
httpwwwidaliuseextetai ha seen more usag it remain to be seen whether they will
realli catch on
yet other form of filter such as recommend from respect member of the commun are also possibl inde one such experi the acm sigmod digit review is
be plan now and will be an overlay over corr
there is clearli a need for valuead servic besid filter as it stand the onli
attempt to organ the paper in corr is by mean of subject classif and acm classif these classif are provid by author without the involv of librarian get librarian activ involv in catalog and index would certainli be nice
but seem far too expens to contempl for the forese futur and will perhap prove
unnecessari it may well be possibl to either autom the classif task or at least
provid author assist with thi in the futur use machinelearn techniqu see
httpwwwcorajustresearchcom for a search engin that also classifi paper for an exampl of one program that doe thi in addit i hope and expect that there will be other
overlay servic that provid differ organ of the materi it is easi to imagin servic
that defin differ special subcollectionsfor exampl a collect tailor to a specif
univers cours or curriculum that possibl cross standard disciplinari boundari and includ document in a number of repositori critic to all such work are good mechan
for citat and crosslink thi is current an activ research area
i have mention a few facil that could be ad to corr directli or provid by
7
overlay it is easi to imagin other facil that could be ad or improv such as an
automat recommend servic i suspect that some of the most use one are the one we
cannot yet imagin we are optimist that given corr open interfac these enhanc
and other will be investig and implement by the effort of mani research in the
commun i expect that as well corr will at some point grow to becom not just a
repositori for eprint but for other artifact such as data set and tool
of cours corr is not the onli repositori in exist or be contempl there are
a number of effort in other disciplin to develop onlin scholarli publish archiv significantli there ha been a recent initi to build an open architectur for onlin repositori so
that all repositori can be link togeth the architectur will in fact be base on ncstrl
dienst protocol just as corr is thi open architectur will permit the feder of onlin
repositori and could be an import step to creat an onlin digit librari
