enrich of nuclear spin isom of molecul by infrar radiat reson to
molecular rovibr transit is consid special attent is given to the
enrich by lightinduc cross of far separ ortho and para state
introduct
nuclear spin isom were discov in the late 1920 when ortho and para h2 were
separ by deep cool of hydrogen ga 1 thi techniqu wa success becaus of
extrem larg gap between the ortho and para state in h2 investig of heavier
isom were not possibl to perform until recent becaus of the lack of appropri
enrich method first separ of heavi molecul ch3 f wa achiev use
the lightinduc drift effect 2 later the isom of h2 o 3 h2 co 4 li2 5 and
c2 h4 6 were enrich a few practic applic of spin isom are alreadi known
for exampl isom can affect chemic reaction 7 8 can significantli enhanc nmr
signal 9 10 or can be use as spin label in nmr base techniqu
further investig of nuclear spin isom and progress in their applic need
new enrich method thi is rather difficult and challeng task becaus physic
and chemic properti of spin isom are almost ident recent new approach
to the isom enrich base on molecular excit by strong electromagnet field
wa propos 11 12 13 14 in thi paper we discuss the isom enrich base on
the coher control by strong infrar radiat we make emphasi on the condit
necessari for the experiment observ of the phenomenon

level scheme
the level scheme is shown in fig 1 we assum that test molecul have onli two
nuclear spin state ortho and para thi is veri often the case eg in ch3 f 15 16 each
of the two vibrat state ground and excit ha one orthopara level pair mix
by intramolecular perturb molecul are embed into a nonmagnet gaseou
environ character by zero crosssect for collision orthopara transit the
infrar radiat is reson to the rovibr transit m n of the ortho molecul

intramolecular perturb that mix the ortho and para state in excit and ground
vibrat state respect these perturb origin from the nuclear spinspin
and spinrot interact 17 18 19 20
suppos that a test molecul is place initi in the ortho subspac of the ground
vibrat state due to collis the molecul will undergo fast rotat and veloc
relax insid the ortho subspac thi will proceed until the molecul jump to the
state m which is mix with the para state k by the intramolecular perturb v see
fig 1 or to the state n which is mix with the para state k by the combin action of
the extern field and intramolecular perturb v admixtur of a para state impli
that the next collis can move the molecul to anoth para state and thu local it
insid the para subspac the spin convers occur
the molecular centerofmass motion affect the process becaus of the doppler effect
vibrat degre of freedom play an import role too after orthopara transit in

upper vibrat state the molecul relax to the ground vibrat state consequ
back convers can onli occur through the unperturb m k channel it is essenti
that convers through the mk channel can be substanti affect by electromagnet

theori 21 the zerothord theori neglect the intramolecular orthopara state mix
by v and v and thu contain no orthopara convers in thi approxim an
extern field doe not affect the popul of para state the popul of ortho

one can see from eq 8 9 and 10 that the convers rate ha two peak the
peak at the absorpt line center 0 appear becaus the excit probabl
p and p v have maximum at 0 the homogen width of thi peak is equal
to b that can be veri larg in molecular system due to the slow rotat veloc
and vibrat relax the peak at 1 is due to the lightinduc cross
of m and k state see ref 13 14 21 and appear formal becaus of the reson
denomin in the integrand in eq 9 and 10 the homogen width of the peak
at 1 is equal to 1
coher control allow to achiev substanti enrich if the mix in ground
and vibrat excit state ha the same order of magnitud 21 on the other
hand close coincid between ortho and para state in molecul are rather rare
consequ such close level pair in excit vibrat state may be absent or they
cannot be access by the avail radiat below we estim the enrich in the
case of larg orthopara gap in excit state kv0 where kv0 is the doppler

discuss
condit necessari for the experiment observ of the lightinduc enrich
are not easi to fulfil first of all the field free convers rate f ree of the molecul
7
under consider should be low in order to enhanc the role of lightinduc chang
in the total rate note that the rate f ree should combin all signific contribut
eg caus by the molecular collis with the wall of the ga contain at present
onli in a few rare case see the introduct the rate f ree are known
next task is to determin the target orthopara level pair in the excit vibrat
state for thi one ha to know rather accur the rel posit of ortho and para
state and the intramolecular orthopara mix effici as well
perhap the most difficult problem is to find power radiat have right frequenc
the most promis sourc of such radiat are the power free electron laser
