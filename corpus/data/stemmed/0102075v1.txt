rieffel deform quantiz and
isospectr deform
andrzej sitarz
abstract we demonstr the relat between the isospectr
deform and rieffel deform quantiz by the action
of rd
1 introduct
the isospectr deform ha been recent introduc by conn
and landi 3 with the exampl of the noncommut 3 and 4
sphere provid new exampl of noncommut spectral tripl
2 howev the construct of similar exampl though in differ
context can be found in earlier work by kulish and mudrov 5 as well
as more recent in paschk phd thesi 6
the properti of isospectr deform ha been recent a subject of much interest 4 in particular the symmetri of isospectr
geometri seen as hopf algebra act on the deform algebra
appear to be a twist by a cartan subalgebra of the univers envelop algebra of lie algebra which were symmetri of the undeform
algebras12 and the construct spectral tripl are symmetr in the
sens of 7
the analysi of symmetri and the gener construct of the
deform as well as the similar of the construct with the wellknown noncommut toru ha led to the connect between the
isospectr deform and rieffel 8 deform quantiz by
the action of rn in fact both the gener construct as well as the
correspond symmetri were alreadi defin in a gener setup by
rieffel see also 9 10 11
in thi letter we show that the isospectr deform as defin
in 3 are the special case of the rieffel construct 8
2 the isospectr deform
in the origin articl 3 one start with the algebra a of smooth
function on a manifold with an isometri group of rank r 2 thi is
support by mari curi fellowship

equival to the statement that the toru t 2 is the isometri subgroup
of the algebra now take the element t which are of c class with
respect to the action of the toru group t s t one can obtain their
decomposit as a norm converg sum of homogen element of
a given bidegre then for ani homogen element one may defin
a deform product by a left or right twist by linear thi extend
to the linear combin of homogen element which are dens
in the algebra we have start with
to make correspond with the rieffel deform quantiz
we shall use the dual pictur of isometri as use in 12
remark 1 let a be an algebra and the toru t 2 be a subgroup of
automorph of a then for everi oper t which is of class c
rel to the isometri s the addit group r2 act as follow
1
x1 x2 t e2ix1 e2ix2 t
use the gener of toru symmetri p1 p2 for instanc
p1 t

d
x1 x2 t
dx1
x0
the relat 1 could be rewritten as
x1 x2 t e2ix1 p1 x2 p2 t
remark 2 with respect to the action of p1 p2 the oper which
are homogen of degre n1 n2 behav like
2
p1 t n1 t p2 t n2 t
remark 3 the product in the algebra a can be deform first on
element of given degre and then extend the deform by linear

a b
a b abn1 n2
where is a complex number such that 1 thi give the right
twist of 3 for futur refer we shall denot the deform algebra
by a
thi deform can be extend in the case of a differenti manifold and a lie algebra act on the differenti function to all c
function 3
it would be use to introduc a quantiz map
a a a a
rieffel deform quantiz and isospectr deform
3
so that the eq3 could be rewritten as
a b
a b abn1 n2
4
it will be use to rewrit the abov quantiz form in a more
abstract form use the action of the gener pi 1
remark 4 the quantiz map 3 could be written as a
5
m a b m 1 a b
where m is the multipl map
m a a a b ab a
and m is similarli the multipl in deform algebra wherea
is
c p1p2

3 rieffel deform by the action of rn
31 gener construct suppos we have an algebra a and the
action of v rn on thi algebra and a linear map j from v the
dual of v to v such that it is skewsymmetr j t j again
one take a subalgebra of element which are c vector in a for the
action of rn
to make a direct correspond with the abov case of isospectr
deform we restrict ourselv to n 2 in analog with poisson bracket on the function on a manifold we might defin a poisson
bracket

p a b
jri api b
i
where pi is the basi of r2 and ri of it dual clearli thi is independ of the choic of the basi see 8 9 and make the algebra a a
strict poisson algebra
then use the oscillatori integr one can defin a deform product

which could be recogn as a deform quantiz in the direct of the poisson structur as defin in 7

we use here a particular form of a more gener formula deriv in 12

32 equival with isospectr deform to obtain the
deform as defin in 3 we have to modifi the express 8 by
allow arbitrari not necessarili antisymmetr oper j
let us calcul explicitli for homogen element a and b we
parameter v coordin x basi pi and v coordin y basi

then

which agre with the definit for the right twist as defin in 3
with e2i
have shown the relat one might use the result valid for the
deform quantiz to thi particular case for instanc to the
noncommut fourspher on the other hand use similar argument as in 3 one will obtain a vast famili of noncommut
spectral tripl and their symmetri by construct the deform
quantiz as describ in 8 of for instanc spin manifold
acknowledg while finish thi paper we have learn

also present in a forthcom work 4
