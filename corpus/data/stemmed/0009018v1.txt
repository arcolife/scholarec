abstract thi paper appli resolut theorem prove to natur languag semant the aim is to circumv the comput complex trigger by natur languag ambigu like pronoun bind by interleav pronoun bind
with resolut deduct to thi end disambigu is onli appli to express that actual occur dure deriv given a set of premis and a conclus our resolut method onli deliv pronoun bind that are need to
deriv the conclus
1 introduct
natur languag process nlp ha a long tradit in artifici intellig but it
still remain to be one of the hardest problem in the area research area such as semant represent and theorem prove with natur languag have to deal with a
problem that is characterist of natur languag name ambigu there are sever
kind of ambigu see for instanc rn95 for an overview in the present paper we
focu on pronoun bind 1 a certain instanc of ambigu as exemplifi by 1 below
1 a man see a boy he whistl
often there are lot of possibl to bind a pronoun and it is not clear which one to
choos the pronoun he in the short discours in 1 can be bound in two way as given
in 2 where coindex indic referenti ident
2 a a mani see a boy hei whistl
b a man see a boyi hei whistl
for some case heurist are applic which prefer certain bind to other but at
present there is no approach make use of heurist which is gener enough to cover
all problem
dynam semant kam81gs91 allow to give a perspicu solut to some
problem involv pronoun bind sinc we are interest in bind occurr of
pronoun to express mention earlier in a discours we take a slight modif
of dynam predic logic dpl gs91 where it is not presuppos that pronoun
1
throughout thi paper we use the term bind to express the referenti identif of a pronoun and anoth referenti express occur in the discours common term are also coindex or pronoun resolut we especi did not use pronoun resolut to avoid confus with resolut as a deduct principl
are alreadi coindex actual pronoun bind fall into the realm of construct
semant represent of natur languag discours and one of the main purpos
of construct these represent is to reason with them now the question aris
which form the input of the theorem prover should have should a theorem prover work
onli on total disambigu express total disambigu result in an explos
of read becaus of the multipl behavior of ambigu on the other hand to
prove a conclus from a set of premis it may be enough to use onli premis from
a small subset of and it may be suffici and much more effici to disambigu
onli instead of the whole set of premis in gener we do not know in advanc
which subset of premis might be enough to deriv a certain conclus but dure
a deriv often certain safe strategi may be appli that prevent some premis
from be use sinc they cannot lead to the conclus anyway common strategi
to constrain the search space in resolut deduct are eg the setofsupport strategi
and order resolut our goal is to constrain the set of premis that have to be disambigu by interleav deduct and disambigu roughli speak premis
are onli disambigu if they are use by a deduct rule
the rest of the paper is structur as follow section 2 provid some rudimentari
background in dynam semant and explain what kind of structur inform is
necessari to restrict pronoun bind in addit the basic of resolut deduct
are introduc section 3 discuss some of the problem of the standard resolut
method when appli to natur languag the method of label unif and resolut is present to overcom these problem section 4 briefli relat our work to
some other approach to pronoun bind section 5 provid some conclus and
prospect for further work
2 background
befor we turn to our method of label resolut deduct and it applic to discours semant we briefli present the idea of dynam semant the second subsect shortli explain the classic resolut method for static firstord logic
21
dynam reason
dynam reason differ from classic reason to the extent that sequenc of formula are consid instead of set of formula to model discours relat like pronoun bind it is import to take the order of sentenc into account becaus two sequenc which have the same member but differ in order may have a differ mean compar a man walk in the park he whistl and he whistl a man walk
in the park
dpl is a semant framework which work on sequenc of formula and it allow
to repres pronoun bind where the anteced of the pronoun and the pronoun itself may occur in differ formula thi is accomplish by assign the existenti
quantifi flexibl bind in 3b a dpl represent of the short discours in 3a
is given
3 a
a mani see a boy hei whistl
b x man x y boy y see x y whistl x
the pronoun he is repres by the variabl x which is the same as the one bound by
the existenti quantifi but it occur outsid of it scope to bind x in whistl x it is
necessari to give the existenti quantifi flexibl scope
one of the advantag of dynam approach like dpl is that they allow for a formal definit of possibl anteced for a pronoun without give too mani detail
we just note that negat function as barrier for flexibl bind therefor an existenti quantifi occur in the scope of a negat cannot bind a pronoun that occur
outsid of the negat as shown by 4
4 john doesnt own a cari iti is in front of hi hous
the three properti a existenti quantifi can bind variabl occur to the
righthand side of their tradit scope b conjunct preserv the flexibl scope
and c negat are barrier for dynam bind allow us to defin the properti of
the other logic connect and is a function that assign to each formula
it semant valu
5
x x
given these definit we see that disjunct is a barrier both intern and extern implic is a barrier extern but intern it allow for flexibl bind and
univers quantif doe not allow for extern bind
we differ in two respect from dpl first we do not allow two or more occurr
of x within a singl text the problem is that the second occurr of x reset the
valu of x and therebi previou restrict on x are lost we assum for simplic that
all bound variabl are disjoint thi is not a sever restrict and an algorithm for construct semant represent for natur languag sentenc can easili accomplish
thi the second differ with dpl is that we do not assum coindex of quantifi and the pronoun which they bind in 3 the variabl for he is alreadi assum to be
x and in dpl the question of pronoun bind is push to some kind of preprocess
but find the right bind is far from be an easi task and it is veri complex from a
comput point of view the pronoun in 3 could also be repres by y indic that that he refer to a boy eg a discours contain twenti indefinit follow
by a sentenc with two pronoun ha 20 20 400 possibl bind disregard ani
linguist constraint which rule out some of the bind
to thi end we postpon pronoun bind and repres pronoun in the semant
represent by free variabl variabl for pronoun are display in boldfac and are
of a differ kind than regular variabl pronoun variabl are bound by the oper
it differ from and becaus it onli bind it argument but doe not quantifi over
it actual it is not necessari to have a special oper for pronoun and we onli introduc it here for the sake of conveni to identifi the posit where the pronoun
is introduc our represent of 1 repeat as 6a below is given in 6b as
mention befor coindex of pronoun and anteced is not carri out
6 a a man see a boy he whistl
b x man x y boy y see x y u whistl u
the task whether u ha to be substitut by x or by y is postpon to the deduct compon as motiv in section 1
unlik the existenti quantifi the oper doe not have the properti of flexibl
bind we get the follow equival
u u
to defin access we can now say that a variabl x is access from a pronoun
u if no barrier occur between the quantifi introduc x and u a formal definit
of access is given in the next section the equat in 5 show that and
introduc barrier becaus of the way they are defin in term of negat thi is
exemplifi by 7 below
7 everi farmer own a donkey i iti is grey
dispens with the presupposit that pronoun and anteced are alreadi coindex reintroduc the concept of ambigu to our framework thi make it necessari to give a definit of the semant of ambigu formula it is common to defin
their semant in term of their possibl disambigu see rey93 and here we follow the same approach a total disambigu is a map from ambigu dynam
formula to classic firstord formula disambigu encompass two step first
we have to find a proper anteced for a pronoun to defin proper anteced we
use the notion of access second we have to map unambigu dynam formula
to classic formula thi mean that we have to turn flexibl quantif into static
quantif and thi involv rebracket and quantifi movement gs91 give an
algorithm that comput for each dplformula a formula which is in normal bind form ie all pronoun are quantifi over in the classic sens and which is valid
in firstord logic iff is valid in dpl for instanc the normal bind form of 8b
is 9
8 a if a farmeri own a donkey j then hei beat it j
b x f x y d y o x y b x y
9 x y f x d y o x y b x y
to defin the valid of ambigu formula we say that an ambigu formula
is valid ie for all model m it hold that m a if there is a disambigu such
that m for all model m in word is valid iff there exist a disambigu
which is valid in firstord logic
unfortun we do not have enough space to give a more detail account of dynam semant but we refer the reader to kam81gs91
22
the resolut method
the resolut method rob65 ha becom quit popular in autom theorem prove becaus it is veri effici and it is easili augment by lot of strategi which
restrict the search space see eg lov78 on the other hand the resolut method ha
the disadvantag of presuppos that it input ha to be in claus form which is a set of
claus interpret as a conjunct a claus is a set of liter interpret as a disjunct probabl the most attract featur of resolut is that it ha onli one infer
rule the resolut rule
c p1 pn d q1 qm
c d
where
re
q1 qm are atom
is a substitut such that c p1 pn and
d q1 qm are variabl disjoint
is the most gener unifi of p1 pn q1 qm
to prove that hold we transform in claus form and tri to deriv a
contradict the empti claus from it by use the resolut rule
for a comprehens introduct to resolut see for instanc lov78
3 dynam resolut
appli the classic resolut method to a dynam semant caus problem below we will first discuss some of them and then see how we have to design our dynam
resolut method to overcom these problem
31
adapt the resolut method
there are two problem that we have to find a solut for first transform formula
to claus form caus a loss of structur inform therefor it is sometim imposs to distinguish between variabl that can serv as anteced for a pronoun and
variabl than can not the second problem concern the duplic of liter which
may occur dure claus from transform and the assumpt of the resolut method
that claus are variabl disjoint although the same pronoun may have two occurr
in differ claus we do not want them to be bound by differ anteced
turn to the first problem in 10 the pronoun u cannot be bound by the existenti
quantifi wherea the pronoun z can be bound by it
10a everi farmer who own a donkey beat it it suffer
b x f x y d y o x y z b x z u s u
11 f x d y o x y b x z s u
how can we tell which identif are allow by look at the correspond claus
form in 11 how do we know whether a term is access
we use label to carri the inform about access variabl each pronoun variabl is annot with a label that indic the set of access variabl besid the set
of firstord or proper variabl var firstord formula form and pronoun variabl pvar we are go to introduc the set of label pronoun variabl lpvar
and label formula lform label pronoun variabl are of the form v u where
v var and u is a pronoun variabl lform is the set of firstord formula plu
formula contain label pronoun variabl to be abl to recogn the anteced
later on each variabl is annot with it name xx yy and dure skolem
onli the variabl is chang but the label remain unchang
to see which variabl insid of a formula can serv as anteced for pronoun
gs91 introduc the function aqv which return the set of activ quantifi variabl when appli to
definit 1 let form be the set of classic firstord formula and var the set of
firstord variabl the function form pow var is defin recurs
r x1 xn
x
x
u
0
0
0
0
0
x
use the abov definit we defin the notion of access variabl
definit 2 annot with access variabl to annot u in u we drop
the bind oper u and substitut all occurr of the pronoun variabl in by
it annot counterpart the annot function var form lform is
defin recurs where v var
v r x1 xn
v
v
v
v
v x
v x
v u
r x1 xn
v
v v
v v
v v
x v x
x v x
v u v u
the actual annot take place in the last case where the pronoun is substitut the
other case thread the activ quantifi variabl through the formula to annot
a whole discours 1 n the variabl paramet of annot is initi with 0
0 1 n a term t x is access from a pronoun u iff x is element of the
set of the access variabl of u
reconsid the last exampl everi farmer who own a donkey beat it it suffer
appli annot yields2
0 x f x y d y o x y z b x z u s u
x f x y d y o x y b x x y z s 0 u
2
for simplic we neglect the fact that pronoun and their anteced have to agre in gender
number etc
appli claus form transform to the annot formula yield
12 f x d y o x y b x x y z s 0 u
we can also see that 10a is not wellform becaus there are no access pronoun
for the second pronoun it ie the label of u is the empti set
now we turn to the second problem how do we make sure that the same pronoun
occur in differ claus is bound to the same anteced as we said earlier we do
not want to assum pronoun to be bound in a set of premis when we appli resolut
the reason is that pronoun bind is highli ambigu and often it is not necessari to
bind all pronoun in a set of premis to deriv a certain conclus from it anoth
issu which we briefli hint at in section 2 is that pronoun should be treat as free
variabl of a special kind not to be dealt with in the same manner as univers quantifi variabl which also happen to be repres by free variabl thi is illustr
by the follow exampl which show an invalid entail
13a x y a x a y za z b c a b c
b a f x a gy a z b a z c b c
the transform in 13 caus a duplic of the liter a z and we have to make
sure that the pronoun is instanti the same way in both case
14 a f x a gy a z b a z c
b c
a gy b
b c
c
in 14 z is instanti with f x in the first resolut step and then with gy in the second
the resolut rule as it wa state in the preced section assum that claus to be
resolv are variabl disjoint we have to modifi the resolut rule such that the same
pronoun variabl is allow to occur in both claus addit the instanti of a
pronoun variabl for construct the most gener unifi in a resolut step is appli
global ie to all claus
15 a f x a gy a z b a z c
a gy b
b c
a f x c
a gy
a f x
global instanti correctli prevent us from deriv a contradict in 15
32
label resolut
unif is a fundament techniqu in the resolut method sinc we are also deal with label variabl we have to think how the unif mechan ha to be
adapt in the cours of thi subsect it will turn out that pronoun bind can be
reduc to unif
label unif we use the unif algorithm of martelli and montanari mm82
as a basi and adapt it in such a way that it can deal with label pronoun variabl
what doe it mean to unifi a set of equat e s1 t1 sn tn where si or
ti can also be a label pronoun variabl we have to distinguish three possibl case
i neither si nor ti is a label pronoun variabl then label unif and normal
unif are the same thing ii one of them is a pronoun and the other is not and iii
both are pronoun case ii is the normal pronoun bind where one tri to identifi a
pronoun with a proper variabl case iii is not an instanc of pronoun bind but an
identif of two pronoun ie whatev is the anteced of the first pronoun it is
also the anteced of the other one
definit 3 label unifi we call a substitut a label unifi or unifi of
a set of equat e s1 t1 sn tn iff
1 s1 t1 sn tn
2 if v u t x then x v
3 if v u v v then v v
we use to express equal in our object languag wherea denot equal in the
meta languag
condit 1 is the normal condit of unifi name that the term of an equat have to be ident after substitut the second condit say that unifi have
to obey access for instanc x y u gz is not a unifi of x y u gz
becaus gz is not access from u as z
x y to ensur that identif of pronoun alway restrict the set of access anteced we need condit 3
definit 4 most gener label unifi a label unifi of a set of equat
e s1 t1 sn tn is the most gener label unifi or mgu of e if
1 if is a unifi of e then there is substitut such that
2 if v u v1 v v u v2 v v1 v2 v and v1 v2 0
then v2 v1
again the first condit is standard in regular unif condit 2 say that the most
gener unifi ha to restrict the set of access anteced as littl as possibl when
identifi pronoun to unifi v1 u and v2 v it suffic to take ani nonempti subset
of the intersect of v1 and v2 but thi fact may prohibit some anteced from be
access although they are in fact access for both pronoun
definit 5 the label unif algorithm first the unif function
is appli to a pair of atom and then it tri to unifi the set of correspond argument
pair the algorithm termin success if it did not termin with failur and no
further equat are applic
r s1 sn r t1 tn
1
s1 t1 sn tn
2 f s1 sn f t1 tn e
s1 t1 sn tn e
3 f s1 sn g t1 tm e f g or n m
termin with failur
4 x x e
e
5 t x e t var
x t e
6 x t e x t t lpvar x in t
termin with failur
7 x t e x t t lpvar x not in t x in e
x t e x t
8 v u t x e x v v u in e
v u t x e v u t x
v1 v2 v2
9 v1 u v2 v e v1 v2 0
v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v
e v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v
the first six equat of the algorithm are the same as in mm82 except for addit
side condit which make sure that t is not a label variabl the interest case are
8 and 9 in 8 a pronoun is bound to an anteced and in 9 two pronoun are identifi
ie they have the same possibl anteced name those which are access for both
of them thi is accomplish by identifi the pronoun variabl and substitut the
set of possibl anteced by the intersect of the possibl anteced of each pronoun
identif of pronoun underli differ constraint than bind a pronoun to a
proper anteced to identifi two pronoun u and v it is not requir that u is access
from v or the other way around but they can onli be identifi if they have at least one
proper access anteced in common
16 buk is a poet for everi man there is a woman who hate him
a there is a woman who hate him
17 p b x w x y w y u h y u
a z w z v h z v
for instanc in 16 the conclus is onli valid if the first and the second occurr
of him are identifi in section 2 it wa said that univers quantif is a barrier for
flexibl bind and therefor the second occurr of him cannot be bound to the first
one on the other hand both of them have a proper anteced in common name the
constant b repres the proper name buk in addit the first occurr of him ha
the variabl x as an access anteced introduc by the univers quantif everi man if one want to identifi them one ha to take the intersect of both set of access anteced and henc drop x as a possibl anteced observ that identif of pronoun still leav some space for underspecif becaus the intersect
of two pronoun doe not have to be a singleton of cours identifi two pronoun
where more than one anteced is access for both forc them to be bound to the
same element of the intersect both can be bound to ani element of the intersect
but it ha to be the same one for both pronoun
if the unif algorithm termin success for a pair of liter pq the solv
set determin a substitut that is the mgu of pq
s t s t p q
a set of equat s1 t1 sn tn is call solv if
1 si var lpvar and the si are pairwis disjoint
2 no si occur in a term t j 1 i j n
lemma 6 correct of the unif algorithm let e be a set of equat
and unifi e e then
i e is unifi iff e is unifi
ii is the mgu of e iff is the mgu of e
proof i we have to show that action 2 4 5 7 8 and 9 preserv unifi when
unifi is appli to a unifi set e for 2 4 and 5 thi is obviou to show it for 7
note that x t is a unifi of x and t if is a unifi of x t e then is
of the form becaus it hold that therefor unifi
x t e iff unifi x t e x t 8 is analog to 7 plu the addit side
condit that x v the last case is 9 if v1 u v2 v e is unifi then it is with
a unifi of the form with v1 u v1 v2 v v2 u v1 v2 v
again and then also unifi
v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v e v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v
ii the action 2 4 5 7 and 8 turn a set of equat into an equival one for
to be the mgu of v1 u v2 v e mean accord to our definit that ha to be
of the form where
v1 u v1 v2 v v2 u v1 v2 v
but then is also the mgu of
v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v e v1 u v1 v2 v v2 v v1 v2 v
lemma 7 termin of the unif algorithm the unif algorithm termin for each finit set of equat
proof if rule 3 and 6 are appli we are done otherwis rule 7 can be appli onli
onc becaus after applic the side condit is no longer fulfil in 9 it is presuppos that v1 v2 is a proper subset of v2 thi ensur that an applic of 9 realli
reduc the set of possibl anteced becaus 9 can be appli onli a finit number
of time it can reintroduc a term v u onli finit often therefor rule 8 can also be
appli onli finit mani time rule 1 5 and 6 are onli appli onc and the number of possibl applic of rule 2 is finit as well becaus term contain onli finit
mani symbol therefor all rule can be appli onli finit mani time and termi
nation follow
proposit 8 total correct of the unif algorithm
the unif algorithm comput for each finit set of equat e a solv set that
ha the same mgu as e in finit mani step iff e is unifi
proof the fact that the unif algorithm preserv unifi and that it termin ha been proven in lemma 1 and 2 respect it remain to be shown that the
set of equat comput by the algorithm is a solv set in 7 8 and 9 the left side of
the equat is alway substitut in e by the right side of the equat if the left side
is ident to the right side the equat is eras by rule 4 therefor no left side of
an equat occur somewher els
the resolut method have defin label unif it is straightforward to
adapt the resolut principl the onli thing we have to chang is to make sure that
variabl disjoint appli onli to proper variabl element of var the function
var return the set of proper variabl when appli to a set of claus var
x var x occur in the resolut rule accomplish pronoun bind re p is
defin as follow
c p1 pn d q1 qm
c d
where
re p
q1 qm are atom
is a substitut such that
var c p1 pn var d q1 qm 0
is the mgu of p1 pn q1 qm
definit 9 the proof algorithm our proof algorithm prf consist of three step
1 annot the conjunct of the premis and the negat of the conclus
2 appli claus form transform and
3 appli the resolut rule until a contradict can be deriv or no new resolv
can be gener
an exampl we will onli give a veri short and therefor veri simpl exampl of a
label resolut deriv we hope that it illustr some of the aspect of label
resolut mention befor
consid exampl 16 again here repeat as 18 where 19 is the correspond
semant represent
18 buk is a poet for everi man there is a woman who hate him

m r xx s t h r f y t b t x u s

actual the onli remark step in the deriv is resolv
m x h f b x u and w z h z b v
with m x w f as the resolv here the two label pronoun variabl can be
identifi becaus the intersect of their access anteced is nonempti the correspond mgu of
m xx h f y b x u w zz h zz b v
x
z
is x z zz f y b x u b v
note also that although p b introduc the anteced b it is not use in the deriv becaus all inform that is necessari to deriv the contradict is captur by
the label thi is the advantag of use label it allow us to express nonloc depend relat in our framework which is essenti for deal with pronoun bind in
dynam semant where a pronoun and it anteced can occur in differ formula
evalu from a linguist point of view in gener it is not enough if one give
just the inform that there is a bind that allow to deriv a conclus but one
also want to know which bind it is easi to augment our method in a way such that
it accomplish thi simpli by memor the substitut of pronoun variabl that
occur dure a deriv
from a linguist point of view one is also interest in compar differ bind if we forc the proof procedur to backtrack everi time it ha found a bind which
allow to deriv a contradict we can gener all possibl bind probabl some
of the bind are prefer to other by take linguist heurist for pronoun resolut into account see for instanc gjw95 but thi is beyond the scope of the present
paper

result
befor we prove complet and sound of our method we have to explain what
these notion mean in our set
to show that the resolut principl is correct we have to find the right loop invari we will show that if the parent claus of a resolut step are strongli satisfi
then so is the resolv
definit 10 strong satisfi we say that a claus c is strongli satisfi if
there is a model m and for all substitut from pvar to var then there is a liter
l c such that m l
lemma 11 let c p1 pn and d q1 qm be variabl disjoint and strongli
satisfi if is the mgu of p1 pn q1 qm then c p1 d p1
is strongli satisfi
proof the set of possibl disambigu of the resolv is a subset of the possibl
disambigu of the parent claus becaus possibl anteced are unifi and in
case of pronoun unif onli the intersect of possibl anteced ha to be consid now two case have to be distinguish
i m pi becaus pi is an instanc of pi and d q1 qm is strongli satisfi it hold that m d p1 but d p1 is a subset of the resolv and
therefor m c p1 d p1
ii m pi again pi is an instanc of pi and c p1 pn is strongli satisfi henc it hold that m c p1 and therebi m c p1
d p1
corollari 12 sound if see definit 9 produc the empti claus on input
then is valid
proof if we can deriv from a set of claus c where c is the claus form of
then we can show by induct that c is not strongli satisfi ie there is no model
m such that m c for all possibl substitut henc for all model m there is a
disambigu such that m which is equival to m a the definit
of be valid
lemma 13 let be a total disambigu of and assum that is unsatisfi
then there is a classic resolut deduct of from
lemma 14 let be a total disambigu of if there is a resolut deduct of
from then gener the empti claus on input
proof the idea of the proof is to turn the classic resolut proof of from into
a label resolut proof of from the origin formula by repeat the resolut
step and insert the requir substitut ie partial disambigu just befor
ani step where they were use in the origin proof
although the idea of thi proof is simpl the detail are too numer to be includ
here
corollari 15 complet if is valid then gener the empti claus on input
4 relat work
most work in the area of ambigu and discours semant focus on represent
issu but see vej96mdr98 for calculi for quantif ambigu approach
that deal with pronoun bind are mostli tri to bind pronoun by appli some
heurist the work that is closest to our is the approach of kohlhas and konrad kk98
who deal with pronoun bind in the set of natur languag correct by use
higherord unif and a higherord tableaux method koh95 to reason about
possibl bind van eijck ve98 present a sequent calculu for dpl which deal
with some of the complic we avoid in thi paper for instanc multipl quantif of the same variabl some of the way in which dynam updat can restrict
possibl pronoun bind are consid in mon98
5 conclus
in thi paper we have present a resolut calculu for reason with ambigu trigger by pronoun and the differ way to bind them deduct step and pronoun
bind are interleav with the effect that onli pronoun that are use dure a deriv are bound to a possibl anteced label allow us to captur relev structur inform of the origin formula on a veri local level name by annot variabl
therefor structur manipul a prerequisit of ani effici proof method doe no
harm
our ongo work focus on two aspect first we have to see how our resolut
method behav when other strategi restrict the search space are ad eg setofsupport strategi order unif or subsumpt check second we are in the
process of implement the annot and unif algorithm and are tri to
integr them into a resolut theorem prover
