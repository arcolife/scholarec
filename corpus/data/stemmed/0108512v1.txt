abstract chemistri play a particular role in astrophys after atom
hydrogen helium and their ion the univers probabl contain more mass in
molecul than in ani other speci molecul format in the earli pregalact
univers may have had much to do with the format of galaxi themselv in
thi context the possibl interact between primordi molecul and photon
of the cosmic microwav background cmb is veri import through the
theoret perspect and constraint which could give some inform on
the theori of the larg scale structur format
in thi paper we recal the more recent progress on the chemistri of the earli
univers and describ the import of molecul in the format phase of
proto object a special attent is done concern the case of lih

introduct
molecul are found in a larg varieti of astronom environ they are
now wide use as diagnost probe of the physic condit in which they
occur the divers of molecular environ ha help to stimul interest
in a varieti of differ chemic process
according1 to the standard big bang cosmolog the space of the univers expand adiabat cool from an extrem initi temperatur and densiti
thu at about one second after the big bang the temperatur of the univers
remain hot and around 1010 k at thi stage the collis between neutron
and proton can form deuterium and open the way of the primordi nucleosynthesi through other fusion reaction see signor puy 1 and refer

the talk of signorepuy in thi proceed and signor puy 1

therein at about 100 sec the nucleosynthesi epoch is over thu most neutron are in 4 he nuclei and most proton remain free while smaller amount
of d 3 he and 7 li are synthet the low densiti the coulomb barrier
and stabil gap at mass 5 and 8 work against the format of heavier
element
after the nucleosynthesi period atom form by recombin of these primordi nucleu with free electron lead to the thermal decoupl between the
matter and the radiat see puysignor 2 the radi recombin
process were then not revers by photoion and electron impact ioniz as they had been earlier becaus the suppli of energet photon and
electron had diminish the univers wa transform into a neutral state
apart from the few relict ion and electron left behind in the expans
the chemistri of the earli univers is the chemistri of the element h it
isotop d helium and their isotop form the ongo physic reaction are
immens after the recombin of hydrogen the main process are collision
ioniz radi recombin attach and radi due to the
presenc of the cmb photoion photodetach dure the last
decad a larg litteratur ha been develop on the chemic network of the
primordi chemistri lepp shull 3 puy et al 4 stancil et al 5 galli
palla 6 puy signor 7 and 2 for histor descript thu primordi
molecul such as h2 hd and lih form
the exist of a signific abund of molecul can be crucial on the dynam evolut of collaps object becaus the cloud temperatur increas
with contract a cool mechan can be import for the structur format by lower pressur oppos graviti thi is particularli true for the
first gener of object
thu in the first part of thi commun we recal the main and recent
result of the molecular influenc on the format of the protoobject particularli that of h2 and hd molecul interact between primordi molecul
and cmb could be import in the second part we will recal the potenti
import of lih molecul on the cmb anisotropi in particular the scatter process of cmb photon on lih molecul could play an import role
and lead to produc secondari anisotropi on the spectrum of cmb we will
conclud thi commun on the possibl outlook

import of h2 and hd for cosmolog
as we have seen earli univers chemistri ha been previous investig by
mani author h2 and hd molecul are the most abund molecul and
could play a nonneglig role on the format of the first object of the
univers these molecul could contribut to cool function and lead to dynam influenc on the collaps mechan moreov although the abund
of h2 molecul is rather insensit to the choic of cosmolog model the
abund of hd molecul show larg variat

21
h2 molecul
eddington 8 then str
omgren 9 were the first to suggest that h2 might
exist in the interstellar space herzberg 10 describ the quantum mechan
of homonuclear molecul in some detail which open import theoret
work on h2 in astrophys although the medium is free of grain after the
cosmolog recombin the format of h2 come into play through the
ion h and h2 in the postrecombin medium the radiat is hotter
than the matter in thi context the radi excit of the rotat level
which is here more effici than the collision excit produc a heat
see puy et al 4
lepp shull 3 were the first to point out thi import characterist
which wa confirm by puy et al 4 with a better estim of the thermal
function in the gravit collaps the situat is veri differ 11 the
temperatur of cmb is below than the matter insid of the collaps thu the
thermal balanc between matter and radiat lead to produc a molecular
cool function h2 becom a good coolant agent of the collaps
the possibl to observ high redshift system is mainli associ with the
presenc of quasar ie strong background sourc most of our knowledg
of the univers between z 1 and 5 come from the studi of the lyman absorb in the optic rang in a minisurvey for molecular hydrogen in
eight highredshift damp lyman system petitjean et al 12 confirm
the presenc of h2 in a system toward pk 1232082 z 23377 they
show that there is no evid for ani correl between h2 abund 2 and
rel heavi element deplet into dust grain
22
hd molecul
the role of deuterium wa analyz by palla et al 13 then complet by
stancil et al 5 in the context of the chemic and thermal evolut of the ga
compon in the postrecombin univers and more recent by flower 14
puy signor 15 reveal that the hd molecul is the main cool agent
a result which wa confirm later by mani author such as okumurai 16
uehara inutsuka 17 and flower et al 18 thu hd molecul could have
import consequ on the problem of fragment of primordi cloud
in order to form first structur like massiv star search for a primordi
signatur of hd is crucial
one must point out that veri recent varshalovich et al 19 have analyz
the spectrum of the quasar pk 1232082 obtain by petitjean et al 12
hd molecular line have been identifi in an absorpt system at the redshift
z 23377 thi is the first detect of hd molecul at high redshift
2 in
thi case the upper limit on the molecular fraction deriv in nine of the system are
in the rang 12 107 16 105

the case of lih
from an initi idea of zeldovich dubrovich 20 show that reson elast
scatter must be consid as the most effici process in coupl matter
and radiat at high redshift he note that the cross section for reson scatter between cosmic microwav background cmb photon and molecul is
sever order of magnitud larger than that between cmb and electron even a
modest abund of primordi molecul would produc signific thomson
scatter
dure an elast scatter between cmb photon and primordi molecul
a photon is absorb and reemit at the same frequenc but not in the
same direct thi process could have neglig effect becaus of low abund of primordi molecul dubrovich 21 maoli et al 22 signor et
al 23 show that thi effect could alter the primari spatial distribut
of the cmb anisotropi more precis reson scatter of cmb photon on lih molecul can be particularli effici for smooth the primari
anisotropi maoli et al 22 point out that primordi molecul such as
lih may play signific role in alter the amplitud and power spectrum of
cmb anisotropi the effect depend essenti on the li abund and the
lithium chemistri they found that primari cbr anisotropi may be eras
or attenu for angular scale below 10o and frequenc below 50 ghz if
lih primordi abund rel to h exceed 1010 in 1996 stancil lepp
and dalgarno 24 implement the first complet postrecombin lithium
chemistri and conclud that the final abund of primordi lih is below
1018 which rule out thi possibl of eras the primari anisotropi
differ studi focus on the chemic evolut in primordi cloud by solv a chemic reaction network within ideal collaps model see puy
signor 11 annino norman 25 abel et al 26 puy signor 15
examin the evolut of primordi molecul in a context of gravit
collaps and show that primordi molecul could coexist in a collaps
protocloud particularli dure the first phase of gravit collaps maoli
et al 27 emphas the role that elast reson scatter through lih
molecul can be produc in thi collaps structur if the scatter sourc
ha a nonzero compon of the peculiar veloc along the line of sight they
show that the elast scatter is no more isotrop in the observ frame
and molecular secondari anisotropi are produc in the cmb spectrum the
angular scale of these secondari anisotropi are therefor directli relat to
the size of the primordi cloud bougleux galli 28 then puy signor
29 studi the chemistri of primordi lih in a collaps protocloud from
the chemic network of stancil et al 24 and the fulli quantum mechan treatment of the radi associ of the excit li state develop
by gianturco gorigiorgi 30 we conclud that with thi chemic network the lih abund is close to 3 1018 lead to veri low secondari
anisotropi in the cmb
nevertheless a precis analysi of the chemic network show that most of reaction rate are quit uncertain for exampl the reaction rate of the main

reaction which dissoci the lih molecul
lih h li h2

is constant and independ of the temperatur and of the densiti

outlook
although astrochem observ start in the visibl they are domin
by the radio and abov all by millimitr and submillimetr observ tent of direct search of primordi molecul were develop thi last decad
but the result were not at the level of effort of team of observ see for
exampl de bernardi et al 31 signor et al 32 comb wiklind 33
recent papadopoulo et al 34 reveal the discoveri of larg amount of
lowexcit molecular ga at redshift z 391 shibai et al 35 investig the observ of hydrogen molecul in absorpt they argu that
the absorpt effici of the hydrogen molecul becom compar with or
larger than that of the dust grain in the metalpoor condit expect in the
earli univers thu the absorpt measur of the hydrogen molecul
could be an import techniqu to explor the primordi ga cloud that are
contract into firstgener object
the herschel satellit 36 could prove the origin of structur and the chemistri at the earli interprotostructur medium and furnish a spectral atla for
molecul see encrenaz et al 37 a submillimetr spectra of protocloud of
ga could offer import constraint on the critic chemistri on dynam on
the heat and the cool process that occur in the primordi ga befor
and dure gravit collaps of protostructur the research of primordi
line with herschel 36 could open an import new field of cosmolog
the cosmochemistri
theori is essenti for mani aspect of astrochemistri or cosmochemistri
chemic model requir chemic rate and these are not alway avail from
experimentalist the calcul of the minimum energi pathway and dynam calcul are crucial thi last point is particularli import for lithium
chemistri recent zaldarriaga loeb 38 explor the imprint of the reson 6708
alin opac of neutral lithium on the temperatur anisotropi of
the cmb at observ wavelength of 250350 m they show that the standard cmb anisotropi would be significantli modifi in thi wavelength band
the primordi chemistri and particularli lih could give same conclus and
import consequ on the temperatur and polar anisotropi
veri recent losecco et al 39 argu that extragalat cold molecular cloud
could lead to a signific absorpt on the cmb they specul that the use of
veri high resolut spectromet on larg apertur telescop might facilit
a 12 order of magnitud improv in the cmb temperatur measur
at high redshift such accur observ would enabl us to constrain the
anisotropi inhomeogen of the univers and the protochemistri
we have seen the possibl of fragment of protocloud by the cool due
5
to h2 and hd molecul thi process could lead to the format of primordi massiv star which could be a possibl sourc of contamin in heavier
element at earli epoch then the gravit collaps of follow object
galaxi could be strongli influenc by the exist of heavier element
such as co ci or hcn
chakrabarti chakrabarti 40 show that a signific amount of adenin
a dna base may be produc dure molecular collaps through the hcn
addit recent sorrel 41 outlin a theoret model for the chemic manufactur of interstellar amino acid and sugar thi chemistri model explain
the exist of both the amino acid glycin and the sugar glycolaldehyd thi
last compon wa recent detect in millimetrewav rotat transit
emiss from the starform cloud sagittariu b2 42 the format of dna
base could happen in the earli histori of the univers prebiot molecul
could have contamin the first object and planet from the begin 43
we are live in a golden age of astronomi new observ with instrument
such as ngst 44 planck45 and herschel 36 will push forward the
frontier of our ignor as herbst wrote astrochemistri may not tell us
much about the first three minut but ultim it should tell us our place in
the univers
