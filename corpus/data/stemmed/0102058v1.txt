abstract theoret overview on phenomenolog of higg boson and susi higg
boson at a futur linear collid experi is given as a higg and susi higg work
group summari report for lcw 2000
introduct
explor the higg sector is one of main motiv for construct an e e
linear collid lc at the futur lc with the center of mass energi of 300 500 gev we can expect to produc 104 105 higg boson with an integr
luminos of 100 1000 fb1 if the higg boson mass is 100 200 gev for such
a rel light higg boson lc can play a role of a higg factori and provid
qualit differ inform from hadron machin even when the higg
particl is discov at tevatron or lhc experi befor the start of the lc
experi
the purpos of the higg factori is to studi variou properti of the higg
particl from the product cross section in the e e z zh process
the higg coupl to two gaug boson can be deduc thi coupl constant
is close relat to the massgener mechan of the gaug boson becaus
both the higgstwogaugeboson coupl and the gaugeboson mass term origin
from the same term in the standard model sm lagrangian by measur thi
coupl constant we can test whether or not the discov scalar particl realli
play a role of the higg boson associ with the electroweak symmetri break
measur of the higg boson coupl to fermion is import to understand
the fermion mass gener mechan eventu we would like to reconstruct
the higg potenti itself by measur threepoint as well as fourpoint higg boson

selfcoupl constant these are fundament question of particl physic and
the e e lc is an ideal place to answer these question
in the higg and susi higg session of thi workshop most of contribut are
relat to the abov question firstli how well can variou coupl constant
be determin in the futur e e and collid with expect accuraci on
those coupl measur is it possibl to distinguish variou model such as the
minim sm the two higg doublet model 2hdm and the minim supersymmetr standard model mssm within a specif model for exampl in the mssm
how well would variou supersymmetr susi paramet be determin sinc
the first question wa mainli address by the experiment summari talk of thi
session 1 more theoret aspect are discuss here in the follow a short
introduct to theoret consider on the higg boson mass is given first
and then the mssm higg sector and the measur of anomal zzh and
zh coupl constant are discuss final the higg physic at a collid
is briefli mention
higg boson mass
the most fundament paramet of the higg sector is the mass of the higg
boson becaus the role of the higg field is to give mass to elementari particl
through electroweak symmetri break the mass of the higg boson itself reflect
the selfinteract of the higg field in the minim sm
with one higg doublet
field the higg boson mass mh is given by mh 2v where is the selfcoupl constant of the higg potenti v 2 h2 h4 and v 246
gev thi formula impli that the mass of the higg boson is close relat to
the strength of interact respons for the electroweak symmetri break and
it determin provid us an import clue on the possibl mechan of the
electroweak symmetri break
more precis we can deriv theoret upper and lower bound of the higg
boson mass if we take a particular model in the minim sm the allow rang is
mh 180 gev if we requir that the theori is valid up to the planck
135 gev
scale mpl 1019 gev the self coupl constant blow up below the planck
scale for a larger higg boson mass than the upperbound wherea turn to a
neg valu and the vacuum stabil is not guarante if the higg boson mass
is less than the lowerbound similar upper and lower bound can be obtain for
the 2hdm 2 and the zee model of neutrino mass gener 3 as a function of
the cutoff scale in these case the allow rang of the mass for the lightest cp mh 180 gev for 1019 gev in the decoupl
even higg boson is 100 gev
case where onli one smlike higg boson is light compar to other physic state
of the higg particl the mass bound of the lightest cpeven higg boson in
the 2hdm are shown in figur 1
in the mssm the upperbound on the the lightest cpeven higg boson mass
mh is determin without refer to the cutoff scale of the theori thi is
becaus the selfcoupl of the higg field is complet determin by the gaug
coupl constant at the tree level take into account the top and stop oneloop
correct mh is given by

where tan h20 h10 is the ratio of the vacuum expect valu of
two higg field 4 in the abov express we have assum that the left and
righthand stop squark have the same mass and there is no mix among two
state in the literatur more precis calcul is avail and it is conclud
that mh is bound by about 130 gev even if we take the stop mass to be a few
tev becaus the expect mass rang is somewhat lower than that deriv under
assumpt that the minim sm is valid up to the planck scale the discoveri of
the higg boson around 120 gev would be a strong indic of the mssm
in extend version of susi model the upperbound of the lightest cpeven
higg boson can be determin onli if we requir that ani of dimensionless coupl
constant of the model doe not blow up below some cutoff scale for the susi
model with an extra gaug singlet higg field the bound is about 150 gev which is
a slightli larger than the upperbound for the mssm case becaus there is a new
tree level contribut to the higg mass formula the maximum valu correspond
to a lower valu of tan which is quit differ from the mssm case where the

higg mass becom larger for larg tan in ref 5 the upperbound of the
lightest cpeven higg boson wa calcul for susi model with gaugesinglet
or gaugetriplet higg field and the maxim possibl valu wa studi in those
extens of the mssm it wa conclud that the mass bound can be as larg
as 210 gev for a specif type model with a triplethigg field for a stop mass of
1 tev the mass bound wa also studi for the susi model with extra matter
field in thi model the upperbound becom larger due to loop correct of

mass becom 180 gev for the case that the squark mass is 1 tev 6
detect of at least one higg boson at lc
becaus the abov upperbound of the lightest cpeven higg boson is at most
about 200 gev at least one of the higg
boson is kinemat access in ani
type of susi model for the e e lc with s 500 gev it is howev import
to know whether such a higg boson can be discov for reason integr
luminos becaus the product cross section and decay mode depend on detail of model in the mssm it wa shown that at least one of two cpeven
higg boson can be detect through e e zhi process with rel low
integr luminos 10fb1 in the model with a singlet higg field there are
three cpeven higg boson and if the lightest one becom singletdomin it
mass bound alon doe not guarante the discoveri of the higg boson becaus
it coupl to gaug boson is veri suppress even in such a case we can show
that at least one higg boson with a sizabl sm higg compon exist below
or around the upperbound of the lightest cpeven higg boson in fact we can
calcul a minim product cross section which mean that at least one of three
cpeven higg boson ha a larger product cross section than that valu in the
e e zhi process the minim cross section turn out to be one third of the
sm higg product cross section evalu at the
upperbound valu thi product cross section is typic 20 50 fb for s 300 500 gev and larg
enough to guarante the discoveri of at least one higg boson independ of it
decay mode 7 furthermor in more gener susi model with arbitrari number ofth higg field it wa shown that the higg signal is observ at e e lc
with s 500 gev and integr luminos of 500 fb1 8 thi is true even if
the higg boson decay to invis mode becaus we can measur a recoil mass
distribut at the lc experi
precis electroweak measur vs the higg boson mass
sinc present electroweak measur are precis enough to be sensit to
virtual loop effect a use constraint on the higg boson mass is obtain in the
minim sm take account of the direct measur of the w boson and top
quark mass in addit to variou electroweak data at lep and sld experi
the 95 upper bound on the sm higg boson mass is about 210 gev9 thi
valu mean that the higg boson is detect in the futur lc with s 500
gev becaus thi bound is obtain within the minim sm it is veri interest
whether or not thi kind of bound can be deriv in other model
in gener 2hdm unlik the mssm case we cannot deriv use mass bound if
we do not consid the condit on the valid of the theori up to some cutoff
scale the question whether we can conclud that at least one of higg boson will be
discov at lc base on present knowledg of the electroweak measur wa
consid in ref 10 and it wa shown that the follow four condit could be
satisfi simultan 1 the light higg boson cpeven h or cpodd a
ha no zzw w coupl
2 the heavi cpeven higg boson h is too heavi to
be produc at lc with s 500 800 gev 3 the product cross section for
e e tth or bbh tta or bba are not larg enough for discoveri in these mode
even with extrem larg integr luminos 2500 fb1 4 these paramet
are still reason consist with the present electroweak precis test although
no direct signal on the higg sector is expect in thi particular paramet space
we can distinguish thi model if we improv the electroweak measur includ
the w boson mass determin at the gigaz option of the lc experi 1011

that the lightest cpeven boson mass receiv a larg radi correct three

two stop mass trilinear coupl constant for stop sector at the higgsino mass

two region in thi figur name when ma is much larger than 150 gev h a and
h state becom approxim degener and the mass of h approach to it
upperbound valu for each tan thi limit is call the decoupl limit in thi
limit h ha properti similar to the sm higg boson and the coupl of the heavi
higg boson to two gaugeboson state is suppress on the other hand if ma is
less than 150 gev the lightest cpeven higg boson ha a sizabl compon of
the sm higg field and the other doublet field sinc lep experi have alreadi
exclud a signific portion of the paramet space it is quit possibl that the
higg boson will be found in the decoupl region if we discov onli one higg
boson at either tevatron or lhc experi in the mass region consist with
the mssm precis measur of the higg particl properti are import
to distinguish thi from the sm higg boson especi in the decoupl and
neardecoupl region the futur lc is the most suitabl place to perform such
precis measur in the follow subsect we discuss variou way to
distinguish the mssm from other model through measur with respect to
the higg sector
nonminim of the higg sector
in the product of the light higg boson the number of the higg signal
provid import inform on the model behind the higg sector becaus the
main decay mode of the light higg boson is h bb e e zhbh bb is a
quantiti expect to be measur precis in fig 3 the mssm paramet region
where e e zhbh bb differ from the sm predict by 6 is shown for
mt 175 gev and mstop 1 tev becaus the statist accuraci of thi quantiti
at the first stage of the futur lc experi is expect to reach a few level
the deviat will be clear within thi paramet region the contour extend to
the line correspond to ma 500 gev in thi figur two other line are drawn
one correspond to the case in which the total width of the higg boson is larger
than 200 mev so that the recoil mass distribut in the e e zh l l h

mass thi figur show that the abov formula is actual a veri good approxim and the ratio is almost independ of other paramet like mstop and at
the expect statist error for 100 fb1 is also shown 13 we can see that thi
quantiti is use to constrain the mass scale of the heavi higg boson
although the lightest cpeven higg boson is like to be discov in the lhc
experi whether or not other higg state h a h can be found depend
on the susi paramet there is a larg portion of the paramet space with

where r bb sm is the same ratio evalu in the sm r bb is the same as
r bb sm if the susi loop effect to the bbh20 vertex is neglig we also notic
that in the decoupl limit with ma tan is approach to 1 tan so
that the ratio reduc to the sm predict thi is becaus the properti of
the lightest cpeven higg boson becom similar to those of the sm higg boson
independ of how the two higg doublet field coupl to the fermion in actual
evalu howev the approach to the asymptot form is slow for larg tan
so that sizabl deviat from the sm predict may be observ
the susi vertex correct also modifi the previou discuss on constrain
ma from rccggbb thi problem wa investig and it wa shown that the effect
on rccggbb is within a few for tan 10 although the uncertainti is too
larg for tan 50 16 thi mean that for the paramet space where the
lhc experi would not find the heavi higg boson rccggbb can still give
import clue on the heavi higg mass scale the theoret uncertainti to the
branch ratio from input paramet such as s mb and mc wa also studi and
the error is about 8 for rccggbb sm and r bb sm if we know s within 2
the ms run quark mass mb mb within 3 and mc mc within 5 the

the vertex correct
the vertex correct also modifi the product and the decay of the heavi
higg boson 18 main effect on the coupl of heavi higg boson to the fermion
is due to the correct to the relat between the bottom mass and the origin
bottom yukawa coupl constant shown in eq5 in so10lik gut model
with yukawa unif for exampl b should be 25 to 18 and the bottom
coupl constant to a and h becom effect larger by the same amount as
a result the product cross section of e e abb hbb below the threshold of
the a h associ product is increas and the and c
c branch ratio
of the heavi higg boson are suppress
determin of tan from heavi higg boson process
in susi model tan is a veri import paramet although it is defin
as a ratio of two vacuum expect valu thi paramet appear in variou
coupl of the mssm lagrangian the consist check of tan determin in
the higg sector the charginoneutralino sector as well as the squarkslepton sector
will be interest becaus these relationship result from susi invari
in the mssm the possibl rang of tan is 1 70 from the requir that the
yukawa coupl constant do not blow up below the planck scale the rang of
2 is exclud from the lep ii higg boson search for reason valu of
tan
stop mass and mix paramet direct determin of tan is a challeng
task for futur lc experi
one of best way to determin tan is to studi heavi higg boson product
and decay becaus the branch ratio and product cross section depend
on tan significantli for the branch ratio a h tt and h bt are
domin for small tan as long as these mode are kinemat allow wherea
a h bb and h becom import for larger valu of tan for
the product process e e bba bbh and e e tbh are enhanc for
larg tan the question to what extent tan can be determin at futur lc
wa address in ref 19 it wa conclud that tan would be well constrain
tan 10 in addit e e tbh
in the intermedi valu of tan 3

product cross section is enhanc for a larg valu of tan

20 within the mssm scenario tan will be well constrain for tan
typic error is 2 for tan 3 and 4 for tan 10 if tan is determin
from the higg sector we can use thi valu as an input paramet for variou
other susi process such as chargino product and stau decay so that we can
perform quantit test of susi lagrangian
singl charg higg boson product
main product process of the charg higg boson
at lc is e e h h
so that the mass reach is kinemat restrict to s2 a singl charg higg
boson product is potenti import becaus the search for a heavier charg
higg boson is possibl
for thi purpos a systemat investig of singl charg higg boson product process at e e lc ha been done 21 product cross section
for 14 process were calcul in the mssm these are e e h
tbh w h e h z 0 w h hw h hw h aw h e e w h
w h e z 0 h e hh e hh and e ah among these process
e e w h e h are oneloop induc process gener the product cross section are veri suppress 102fb1 below the h h pair product threshold but the two process are found to be promis name
e e h for larg tan case and e e w h for small tan case
have product cross section of 001 1fb1 for s 500 gev and therefor
may be observ with integr luminos of 500 fb1
anomal coupl measur
at e e lc experi a great number of light higg boson are expect to
be produc through the e e zh f fh process we can put constraint
on anomal coupl constant for the zzh and zh vertex becaus these
coupl constant gener addit contribut to the zh product process
through interfer with the sm process 22 up to dimensionf oper these
anomal coupl are given by

where v a or z and v v v v v for s 500

constant were studi for mh 115 gev in particular effect of helic measur of lepton 50 charg identif of the bottom quark b 60
as well as beam polar pe 80 pe 45 were investig these
option turn out to be use to improv the measur of anomal coupl
constant with these option the abov paramet can be constrain to the level
of 104 in particular the improv is signific for the zh coupl measur thi is becaus the interfer term between the sm amplitud and
the amplitud with the zh coupl is suppress without these option due to
the almost axialvector natur of the e e z coupl in the sm
photonphoton collid
in the photonphoton option of the lc experi we can directli measur
h bh bb by the schannel higg boson product process assum
that bh bb will be alreadi precis known from the e e lc experi
we can obtain the two photon partial width of the higg boson combin with
the inform on bh the total decay width will be deriv becaus
h is induc by heavi particl loop accur determin of h
is veri interest as a possibl window to new physic
in order to estim the accuraci we have to evalu rate of the signal and
background process in the sm in thi workshop recent develop on the radi correct for these process were report 2324 in the sm background
process e e bb the born cross section for jz 0 channel is suppress by
m2b s compar to that for jz 2 channel so that we can use polar of
initi photon to suppress the background on the other hand there is a larg
qcd correct to thi process and care treatment of higher order correct
is necessari the radi correct to the sm signal and background process
are under control and it wa report that the measur of two photon decay
width with a statist accuraci of 14 would be possibl for a higg boson mass
of 115 gev use the tesla paramet 24
one exampl of possibl role in identifi a new physic from the two photon
partial width of the higg boson wa discuss 25 in 2hdm it may be possibl
that onli a light higg boson is found at lhc and e e lc experi and it
coupl to gaug boson and fermion are found to be consist with the sm
higg boson within the expect accuraci of these experi even in such a
situat the deviat of h from the sm valu can be as larg as 10
so that the twophoton decay width measur may be abl to provid the first
hint for nonmimim of the higg sector
summari
we have discuss variou exampl in which studi of the higg sector at futur
lc experi provid signal of physic beyond the sm if in fact a light higg
boson is found at tevatron lhc or lc experi the role of lc will be the
higg factori by precis determin of product cross section and branch
fraction we can test whether the observ particl correspond to the sm higg
boson or the mssm higg boson within the mssm we can put a constraint on
the susi paramet if kinemat allow heavi charg and neutral higg
boson may be produc and their properti are use to identifi model the
photonphoton option is also use to search for new physic through loop effect
in the two photon decay width of the higg boson these measur are import to establish or distinguish variou candid of model such as the minim
sm mssm 2hdm or some other possibl which may be highlight in futur
