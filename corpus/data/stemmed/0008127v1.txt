introduct
the standard model of particl physic sm combin the electroweak and strong interact base on the local su3 su2l u1i gaug group the electroweak gaug
field w z and the photon field a correspond to the four gener of the nonabelian
su2l u1i gaug group wherea the eight gener of the colour group su3 are
associ with the equival number of gluon the interact between matter and gaug
field is incorpor in the theori by minim substitut which replac the partial deriv in the lagrangean with the covari one includ the coupl relat to the variou
gaug group at thi stage matter and gaug field are still massless in contradict to
the experiment observ introduc explicit mass term howev would violat the
gaug invari and lead to a nonrenormaliz theori with an infinit number of paramet to be adjust by the experi anoth difficulti aris due to the violat of the
unitar bound at high energi by the scatter amplitud of the massiv w z boson
and fermion
a way out is provid by introduc an addit weak isodoublet scalar field 14
one of the four degre of freedom correspond to a physic particl the socal higg
boson the selfinteract of the scalar field lead to an infinitenumb of degener
ground state with nonzero vacuum expect valu vev v 2gf 12 246 gev
by choos one of them as physic ground state the su2l u1i symmetri is hidden
with the u1em symmetri left over the higg coupl to other particl are defin
by the constraint set by unitar through the interact with the scalar field in the
ground state the electroweak gaug boson and the fundament matter particl acquir
their mass the nonvanish field strength essenti for the nonzero particl mass
is induc by the typic minimax form of the higg potenti after the spontan
symmetri break the three goldston boson among the four degre of freedom of the
higg doublet are absorb to provid the longitudin mode for the massiv z and w
gaug boson sinc all the higg coupl are predetermin the paramet describ
the higg particl are entir fix by it mass thi is the onli unknown paramet in the
sm higg sector 3 4
the standard model is in veri good agreement with electroweak precis test at lep
slc tevatron and hera in some case it ha been test to an accuraci better than
01 up to now the onli deviat from the standard model ha been the experiment
indic of massiv neutrino which can be embed in the sm by introduc a mass
term for neutrino in the yukawa lagrangean thi strongli limit possibl form of new

physic model that preserv the sm structur extend by the neutrino mass term are to
be favour in thi respect a promis candid for possibl extens is supersymmetri

in view of the impress success of the sm one may ask of cours whi to consid
extens to new physic the reason is that the sm impli mani unansw question
the extrapol of the model to high energi indic a unif of all three gaug
coupl at mass scale of the order of mgu t 1014 1016 gev 7 grand unifi theori
gut if one assum new physic to set in at the gut scale
sm will be valid in a mass
the 12
rang between the rel small weak scale of the order of 2gf
246 gev set by the
higg mechan and mgu t given by the grand unif scale quantum fluctuat
howev lead to larg correct of the higg mass at high scale in order to keep the
higg mass stabl in the presenc of the larg gut scale the consider correct have
to be absorb in the mass counterterm lead to a finetun of the higg paramet
a stabil of the separ between the electroweak and the gut scale is provid by
the introduct of supersymmetri susi which incorpor the most gener symmetri
of the smatrix within the framework of supersymmetri the mass of the scalar particl
remain moder even in the presenc of high energi scale thi is due to supersymmetri
repres a connect between fermion and boson degre of freedom so that quantum
correct aris from the two particl type cancel each other even in softli broken
supersymmetri the lead quadrat singular vanish and are replac by logarithm
diverg furthermor susi gut lead to a predict of the electroweak mix angl

minim realiz of supersymmetri is given by the minim supersymmetr extens of
the standard model the mssm 3 5 6
the higg mechan describ abov is a basic ingredi of the electroweak sector both
of the standard model and the mssm so far howev it ha not been verifi experiment in order to establish thi most import aspect for the consist formul of an
electroweak theori experiment three step have to be perform
1 first of all the higg particl must be discov
2 in a second step the higg coupl to the fermion and gaug particl have to be
determin via the partial decay width and the higg product cross section
3 in order to final reconstruct the higg potenti the trilinear and quadrilinear higg
selfcoupl have to be measur
the discoveri of a scalar particl alon will not reveal the mechan by which the fundament particl mass are gener onli the knowledg of the higg selfinteract will
allow for the determin of the explicit form of the higg potenti
in thi work the procedur for the experiment verif of the higg sector will be
analys for thi task the pictur of the higg particl will be evolv in the three step
describ in the previou paragraph for reason resum abov not onli the sm but also
a supersymmetr extens the mssm which involv five physic higg particl 3 5 6
will be consid the theoret foundat will be develop and the experiment
implic at the larg hadron collid 9 which is construct for a cm energi of
14 tev and at high energi e e linear collid 10 will be discuss the total integr

luminos for the lhc is l 100 fb1 after 3 year e e linear collid are plan to
run in the energi rang between 500 gev and 1 tev possibl extend later up to 5 tev
for the tesla design thi correspond to an integr luminos of l 300 fb1 per
year at 500 gev and of 500 fb1 for a cm energi of 800 gev 10
the structur of the thesi which reflect the experiment scheme to be pursu is as
follow chapter 2 will start with the set of the scene by describ the sm higg
coupl and the mssm higg sector from the theoret point of view
the third chapter will be devot to the higg boson search at pp collid and in e e
collis first the product mechan will be review befor turn on to the perspect for the higg discoveri in the divers decay channel at the two collid type the
final pictur will display a paramet region in which the discoveri of the heavi mssm higg
boson will be difficult if not imposs therefor the product and discoveri potenti in
the mode at e e linear collid will be analys use weizsackerwilliam photon for
the product of higg boson provid too small a number of event the rate is suffici
larg howev if the photon are produc through the backscatt of laser light from
highenergi electronpositron beam thi mechan 11 allow for the product of
real photon with high energi luminos 12 and monochromat and a high degre of
polar of the scatter photon sever decay channel will be examin with regard
to a suffici larg signal to background ratio nexttolead order correct will be
includ and where necessari the resumm of larg logarithm will thoroughli be taken
into account
onc the higg boson will be discov and it mass will be determin the next step
is the measur of the higg coupl to the gaug and matter particl via the higg
decay chapter 4 will present the branch ratio for the variou decay channel of the sm
higg scalar and the mssm higg boson the knowledg of the branch ratio and the
decay width allow for the extract of the lifetim of the higg boson which togeth with
the mass form the basic characterist of particl therefor chapter 4 will continu with
evolv the theoret setup for the determin of the sm and mssm higg lifetim
in a modelindepend way some repres exampl at e e collid will be given
the first chapter describ the determin of the necessari ingredi ie the mass
and lifetim of the higg state and the yukawa and gaugehigg boson coupl from a
theoret and experiment point of view enabl final the measur of the higg
selfcoupl chapter 5 deal with thi task which is essenti in order to establish experiment the higg sector harbor the mechan for the gener of particl mass
special emphasi will henc be on thi part of the thesi the plethora of mechan which
allow the access to the trilinear higg selfcoupl in pp and e e collis will be describ the final pictur unveil a theoret conclus way of determin all possibl
trilinear higg selfcoupl in the sm and the mssm the size of the cross section for these
process will be discuss includ a short sideview on the one involv selfcoupl
among four higg particl the phenomenolog implic in particular the perspect for the measur of the trilinear higg selfcoupl will be examin by review
exist background studi
the thesi will be conclud with a summari of the salient featur of the investig

the cross section for h h product via higgsstrahlung and pair product are among
themselv and mutual complementari to each other be proport either to sin2
or cos2 sinc sm is larg at least the light cpeven higg boson should be
found if sin2 is small also ma is small and h can then be detect in associ
product with a light a
the upper plot in fig 37 show repres exampl of the cross section for the
product of neutral higg boson as a function of the higg mass for tan 3 and 30
in the decoupl limit where sin 1 the hz cross section becom maxim be
of o60 fb in contrast the hz cross section is larg at the lower end of the mass rang
the signal signatur also for hz in most of the paramet space involv a z boson and
a bb or pair sinc the process ah grow with cos2 it increas toward lower
mh mass where co approach it maximum absolut valu the complementari
process ah is prefer for larg mh the signatur will in both case includ four b quark
in most of the paramet space so that a good btag perform will be requir in order
to separ the signal from the background due to qcd jet and z boson pair product
for small higg mass below 160 gev for s 500 gev w w fusion domin
over higgsstrahlung 28 yet it involv neutrino in the final state thu render the
extract of the signal more difficult on the other hand the lepton final state of zz
fusion allow for the full signal reconstruct although it is an order of magnitud smaller
than the w w fusion process
the lower plot in fig 37 show the product cross section for charg higg boson
as a function of the higg mass for tan 3 and 30 if kinemat allow they are
produc via topdecay t b h for tan 1 charg higg boson decay into

final state in t decay for larg mass mh the boson have to be pairproduc in e e
collis e e h h the cross section which onli depend on mh decreas fast due
to p wave suppress 3 near the threshold collis howev yield larger cross

case of the interfer part the nlo correct are larg
the background contribut can be reduc enorm by cut away the 3jet event
with the chosen cut defin the 2jet topolog the background is suppress by 2 order of

it is the non helicityflip jz 0 state which remov the m2b s suppress at nlo in
contrast the signal is reduc by 40 while the interfer part is reduc by an order

to be taken into account
the partial decay width i is extract from the invers process i h or in associ

if either the initi or the final state i are not onshel the correspond higg form factor

tabl 52 total cross section for sm pair product in w w and zz fusion at e e
collid for two characterist energi and mass in the intermedi rang unpolar
beam
a rough estim of the cross section for the process e e w w hh e e can be
obtain though the valu of the exact calcul is overestim by a factor 2 to 5
depend on the collid energi the approxim cross section is help for a transpar
interpret of the exact result
for high energi the cross section is domin by the tchannel exchang which doe
not includ the trilinear higg selfcoupl the convolut w w fusion process e e
hh e e nevertheless remain sensit to hhh becaus the major contribut to the cross
section stem from the lower end of the w w spectrum so that also in the highenergi limit
the sensit to the higg selfcoupl is maintain
in the subsequ analysi the exact valu for the w w fusion cross section have been
use with the w boson be offshel and the transvers degre of freedom includ the
cross section have been calcul numer with the semianalyt comphep program
106 the electronpositron beam are taken opposit polar thu enhanc the cross
section by a factor four sinc the w boson onli coupl
to lefthand electron the
result are shown in fig 59 for three collid energi s 500 gev 1 tev and 16 tev
as a function of the higg mass as anticip the w w fusion cross section increas with
rise energi the arrow indic the modif of the cross section due to the variat
of the higg selfcoupl from 12hhh to 32 hhh fig 510 show the variat of the
cross section with 1 to 2 due to destruct interfer with the gaug diagram
the cross section decreas with rise hhh as expect the sensit to a variat of
the higg selfcoupl is smaller for high cm energi
the cross section for zz fusion are not shown becaus they are an order of magnitud
below the w w fusion valu as can be infer from tabl 52 thi is due to the small
of the ze e coupl
the preced discuss show that for moder energi doubl higgsstrahlung e e
zhh is the prefer channel for measur of the trilinear higgsself coupl wherea
for energi in the tev rang w w doubl higg fusion e e w w hh e e is the
more suitabl channel sinc for both process the cross section are nevertheless small

conclus
thi thesi ha present a theoret analysi of the properti of the sm and mssm higg
boson which can be investig at the lhc and e e linear collid
the search for higg boson is crucial to prove their exist although there are sever
product mechan at the lhc that allow to find the sm or the mssm higg boson
experiment studi exhibit a region around moder valu of tan where the heavi
mssm higg particl h and a may escap detect an altern to the search for
h and a at the lhc is provid by higg boson product at collid which may be
realiz by compton backscatt of laser light from highenergi electronpositron beam
the most promis search channel with larg branch ratio are given by the higg decay
into bb tt and chargino or neutralino pair they have been investig by includ
the polar nlo result for the signal background and interfer process and also
the resumm of higher order where necessari polar of the electronpositron
and laser beam help to increas the signific by suppress the helic mode of the
background process that are not compat with the signal
for the anticip luminos at futur collid the bb mode develop suffici
high signific for the h and a discoveri in the whole analys mass rang from 200 to
800 gev for moder and larg valu of tan the restrict to twojet topolog in the
final state and a cut in the scatter angl of the bquark with respect to the beam axi
have been crucial for the reduct of the background sinc the higg yukawa coupl to
increas with tan also the channel provid a discoveri potenti in part of
the ah mass rang for larg valu of tan for the tt and chargino decay channel the
extract of the signal will be more challeng due to larger background the higg search
in the neutralino channel is confront with decay product stem from chargino beyond
the correspond kinemat threshold thi is due to the final state of the neutralino and
chargino cascad decay be rather similar becaus of the escap lsp and neutrino
the differ decay topolog may be exploit howev in order to extract the signal
summar the result fusion at e e linear collid provid a valuabl altern
for the heavi higg boson search in a varieti of decay channel of which the bb mode is
outstand
in addit to the mass the second basic featur character higg particl is their
lifetim or equival their total width mechan that can be exploit at e e linear
collid for the determin of the small lifetim of a sm higg boson in the intermedi
mass rang have been compar they use the relat tot i brhi where i denot
87

the partial width and brhi the branch ratio of the higg decay into the final state
i the channel allow a modelindepend determin of tot altern the
lifetim can be measur in the w w channel due to possibl anomal hw w coupl
involv in the w w fusion process the analysi is modeldepend howev the model
depend will be reduc for small momentum transfer at the hw w vertex the error
of the lifetim extract from the w w mode is smaller than in the channel take into
account the uncertainti in the variou cross section the total width can be deduc with
an accuraci better than 10 for higg boson with mh
160 gev from the w w mode
a qualit discuss ha demonstr that the lifetim of a light mssm higg scalar h
can be determin from the bb channel the bb branch ratio occur in the higgsstrahlung
process and the higg yukawa coupl to bquark is access in associ product of
h with a bb pair
to complet the profil of the higg boson their selfcoupl have to be measur the
knowledg of the higg selfinteract allow the reconstruct of the higg potenti and
thu the experiment verif of the higg mechan in thi thesi the theoret
framework ha been set up for the measur of the trilinear higg coupl they are
access in doubl and tripl higg product the process for sm higg boson in the
intermedi mass rang and for mssm higg particl turn out to be small at e e linear
collid although at the lhc the cross section are larger the signal is confront with a
larg qcd background the extract of the higg selfcoupl will therefor be easier in
an e e environ where the background is significantli smaller for high luminos
the trilinear selfcoupl of an intermedi mass higg boson can alreadi be measur in
the first step of a linear collid ie at cm energi of 500 gev high btag effici
provid the experiment accuraci in hhh will be 20
the mssm with five physic higg state includ six trilinear higg coupl among the
neutral particl and mani more quadrilinear selfcoupl the trilinear coupl are involv in a larg number of process at e e linear collid and the lhc in e e collis
the coupl among three light higg boson h can be extract from continuum product apart from the decoupl limit thi coupl differ strongli from the correspond
sm valu the remain coupl among cpeven higg boson will also be access
though in a smaller rang of the basic input paramet ma and tan the trilinear coupl involv pseudoscalar higg state are small in the mssm and the measur of
doubl and tripl higg product process will impos upper bound on the size of these
coupl at the lhc the signal is plagu by an enorm qcd background reson
decay h hh provid a mean of extract the hhh coupl the measur of
