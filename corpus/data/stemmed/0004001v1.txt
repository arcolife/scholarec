abstract
decis theori formal solv the problem of ration agent in uncertain world
if the true environment prior probabl distribut is known solomonoff theori of univers induct formal solv the problem of sequenc predict for
unknown prior distribut we combin both idea and get a parameterless theori
of univers artifici intellig we give strong argument that the result ai
model is the most intellig unbias agent possibl we outlin for a number of
problem class includ sequenc predict strateg game function minim reinforc and supervis learn how the ai model can formal solv
them the major drawback of the ai model is that it is uncomput to overcom thi problem we construct a modifi algorithm ai tl which is still effect
more intellig than ani other time t and space l bound agent the comput
time of ai tl is of the order t2l other discuss topic are formal definit of
intellig order relat the horizon problem and relat of the ai theori to
other ai approach

artifici intellig the scienc of artifici intellig ai might be defin
as the construct of intellig system and their analysi a natur definit of
system is anyth which ha an input and an output stream intellig is more
complic it can have mani face like creativ solv problem pattern recognit
classif learn induct deduct build analog optim surviv
in an environ languag process knowledg and mani more a formal definit
incorpor everi aspect of intellig howev seem difficult further intellig
is grade there is a smooth transit between system which everyon would agre
to be not intellig and trueli intellig system one simpli ha to look in natur
start with for instanc inanim crystal then come aminoacid then some rna
fragment then virus bacteria plant anim ape follow by the truli intellig
homo sapien and possibl continu by ai system or et so the best we can expect
to find is a partial or total order relat on the set of system which order them wrt
their degre of intellig like intellig test do for human system but for a limit
class of problem have thi order we are of cours are interest in larg element
ie highli intellig system if a largest element exist it would correspond to the most
intellig system which could exist
most if not all known facet of intellig can be formul as goal driven or more
precis as maxim some util function it is therefor suffici to studi goal
driven ai eg the biolog goal of anim and human is to surviv and spread
the goal of ai system should be to be use to human the problem is that except
for special case we know neither the util function nor the environ in which the
system will oper in advanc
main idea we propos a theori which formally2 solv the problem of unknown goal
and environ it might be view as a unif of the idea of univers induct
probabilist plan and reinforc learn or as a unif of sequenti decis
theori with algorithm inform theori we appli thi model to some of the facet
of intellig includ induct game play optim reinforc and supervis learn and show how it solv these problem class thi togeth with gener
converg theorem motiv us to believ that the construct univers ai system
is the best one in a sens to be clarifi in the sequel ie that it is the most intellig
environment independ system possibl the intent of thi work is to introduc
the univers ai model and give an in breadth analysi most argument and proof are
succinct and requir slow read or some addit pencil work
content section 2 the gener framework for ai might be view as the design and
studi of intellig agent 31 an agent is a cybernet system with some intern state
which act with output yk to some environ in cycl k perceiv some input xk from
2
with a formal solut we mean a rigor mathemat definit uniqu specifi the solut
in the follow a solut is alway meant in thi formal sens
1 introduct
4
the environ and updat it intern state then the next cycl follow it oper
accord to some function p we split the input xk into a regular part xk and a credit
ck often call reinforc feedback from time to time the environ provid
nonzero credit to the system the task of the system is to maxim it util defin as
the sum of futur credit a probabilist environ is a probabl distribut q
over determinist environ q most if not all environ are of thi type we
give a formal express for the function p which maxim in everi cycl the total
expect futur credit thi model is call the ai model as everi ai problem can be
brought into thi form the problem of maxim util is henc be formal solv
if is known there is noth remark or new here it is the essenc of sequenti
decis theori 6 27 40 notat and formula need in later section are simpli
develop there are two major remain problem the problem of the unknown true
prior probabl is solv in section 4 comput aspect are address in section
10
section 3 instead of talk about probabl distribut q over function one could
describ the environ by the condit probabl of provid input x1 xn to the
system under the condit that the system output y1 yn the definit of the optim
p system in thi iter form is shown to be equival to the previou function form
the function form is more eleg and will be use to defin an intellig order relat
and the timebound model in section 10 the iter form is more index intens but
more suitabl for explicit calcul and is use in most of the other section further
we introduc factoriz probabl distribut
section 4 a special topic is the theori of induct in which sens predict of the
futur is possibl at all is best summar by the theori of solomonoff given the initi
binari sequenc x1 xk what is the probabl of the next bit be 1 it can be fairli well
predict by use a univers probabl distribut invent and shown to converg to
the true prior probabl by solomonoff 35 36 as long as which need not be known
is comput the problem of unknown is henc solv for induct problem all ai
problem where the system output doe not influenc the environ ie all passiv
system are of thi induct form besid sequenc predict sp classificationcf
is also of thi type activ system like game play sg and optim fm can
not be reduc to induct system the main idea of thi work is to gener
univers induct to the gener cybernet model describ in section 2 and 3 for
thi we gener to includ condit and replac by in the ration agent model
in thi way the problem that the true prior probabl is usual unknown is solv
univers of and converg of will be shown these are strong argument
for the optim of the result ai model there are certain difficulti in prove
rigor that and in which sens it is optim ie the most intellig system further
we introduc a univers order relat for intellig
section 59 show how a number of ai problem class fit into the gener ai model all
these problem are formal solv by the ai model the solut is howev onli formal
becaus the ai model develop thu far is uncomput or at best approxim
these section should support the claim that everi ai problem can be formul and
henc solv within the ai model for some class we give concret exampl to
1 introduct
5
illumin the scope of the problem class we first formul each problem class in it
natur way when problem is known and then construct a formul within the ai
model and prove it equival we then consid the consequ of replac by
the main goal is to understand whi and how the problem are solv by ai we onli
highlight special aspect of each problem class section 59 togeth should give a better
pictur of the ai model we do not studi everi aspect for everi problem class the
section might be read select they are not necessari to understand the remain
section
section 5 use the ai model for sequenc predict sp is ident to baysian
sequenc predict sp one might expect when use the ai model for sequenc
predict one would recov exactli the univers sequenc predict scheme sp as
ai wa a unif of the ai model and the idea of univers probabl unfortun thi is not the case one reason is that is onli a probabl distribut in
the input x and not in the output y thi is also one of the origin of the difficulti
of prove errorcredit bound for ai nevertheless we argu that ai is equal well
suit for sequenc predict as sp is in a veri limit set we prove a weak
error bound for ai which give hope that a gener proof is attain
section 6 a veri import class of problem are strateg game sg we restrict ourselv to determinist strictli competit strateg game like chess if the environ
is a minimax player the ai model itself reduc to a minimax strategi repeat game
of fix length are a special case for factoriz the consequ of variabl game
length is sketch the ai model ha to learn the rule of the game under consider
as it ha no prior inform about these rule we describ how ai actual learn
these rule
section 7 there are mani problem that fall into the categori resourc bound function
minim fm they includ the travel salesman problem minim product cost invent new materi or even produc eg nice paint which are
subject judg by a human the task is to approxim minim some function f y z within minim number of function call we will see that a greedi model
tri to minim f in everi cycl fail although the greedi model ha noth to
do with downhil or gradient techniqu there is noth like a gradient or direct for
function over y which are known to fail we discov the same difficulti fm ha
alreadi nearli the full complex of gener ai the reason be that fm can activ
influenc the inform gather process by it trial yk wherea sp and cf cannot
we discuss in detail the optim fm model and it invent in choos the y y
a discuss of the subtleti when use ai for function minim follow
section 8 reinforc learn as the ai model doe is an import learn techniqu but not the onli one to improv the speed of learn supervis learn ie
learn by acquir knowledg or learn from a construct teacher is necessari we
show how ai learn to learn supervis it actual establish supervis learn veri
quickli within o1 cycl
section 9 give a brief survey of other gener aspect idea and method in ai and their
connect to the ai model some aspect are directli includ other are or should be

section 10 up to now we have shown the univers charact of the ai model but have
complet ignor comput aspect let us assum that there exist some algorithm
p of size l with comput time per cycl t which behav in a suffici intellig
way thi assumpt is the veri basi of ai the algorithm p should run all algorithm
of length l for t time step in everi cycl and select the best output among them so we
have an algorithm which run in time l2t and is at least as good as p ie it also serv our
need apart from the veri larg but constant multipl factor in comput time
thi idea of the type monkey one of them eventu produc shakespear is well
known and wide use in theoret comput scienc the difficult part is the select
of the algorithm with the best output a further complic is that the select process
itself must have onli limit comput time we present a suitabl modif of
the ai model which solv these difficult problem the solut is somewhat involv
from an implement aspect an implement would includ first order logic the
definit of a univers ture machin within it and proof theori the assumpt
behind thi construct are discuss at the end

the ai model in function form
the cybernet or agent model a good way to start think about intellig
system is to consid more gener cybernet system in ai usual call agent
thi avoid have to struggl with the mean of intellig from the veri begin
a cybernet system is a control circuit with input y and output x and an intern state
from an extern input and the intern state the system calcul determinist or
stochast an output thi output action modifi the environ and lead to a
new input recept thi continu ad infinitum or for a finit number of cycl as
explain in the last section we need some credit assign to the cybernet system
the input x is divid into two part the standard input x and some credit input c
if input and output are repres by string a determinist cybernet system can be
model by a ture machin p p is call the polici of the agent which determin
the action to a receipt if the environ is also comput it might be model by
a ture machin q as well the interact of the agent with the environ can be
illustr as follow

p as well as q have unidirect input and output tape and bidirect work tape
what entangl the agent with the environ is the fact that the upper tape serv as
input tape for p as well as output tape for q and that the lower tape serv as output
tape for p as well as input tape for q further the read head must alway be left of the
write head ie the symbol must first be written befor they are read p and q have
their own mutual inaccess work tape contain their own secret the head
move in the follow way in the kth cycl p write yk q read yk q write xk ck xk
p read xk ck xk follow by the k 1th cycl and so on the whole process start
with the first cycl all head on tape start and work tape be empti we want
to call ture machin behav in thi way chronolog ture machin for obviou
reason befor continu some notat on string are appropri
string we will denot string over the alphabet x by s x1 x2 xn with xk x
where x is altern interpret as a nonempti subset of in or itself as a prefix free
set of binari string ls lx1 lxn is the length of s analog definit hold
for yk y we call xk the k th input word and yk the k th output word rather than letter
2 the ai model in function form
8
the string s y1 x1 yn xn repres the inputoutput in chronolog order due to the
prefix properti of the xk and yk s can be uniqu separ into it word the word
appear in string are alway in chronolog order we further introduc the follow
abbrevi is the empti string xnm xn xn1 xm1 xm for n m and for n m
xn x1 xn1 analog for y further yxn yn xn yxnm yn xn ym xm and so on
ai model for known determinist environ let us defin for the chronolog ture machin p a partial function also name p x y with y1k pxk where
y1k is the output of ture machin p on input xk in cycl k ie where p ha read up to
xk1 but no further in an analog way we defin q y x with x1k qy1k convers for everi partial recurs chronolog function we can defin a correspond
chronolog ture machin each systemenviron pair p q produc a uniqu
pq pq
io sequenc p q y1pq xpq
1 y2 x2 when we look at the definit of p and q we see a
nice symmetri between the cybernet system and the environ until now not much
intellig is in our system now the credit assign come into the game and remov
the symmetri somewhat we split the input xk x c x into a regular part xk x
and a credit ck c ir we defin xk ck xk and ck cxk the goal of the system
should be to maxim receiv credit thi is call reinforc learn the reason
for the asymmetri is that eventu we human will be the environ with which
the system will commun and we want to dictat what is good and what is wrong
not the other way round thi one way learn the system learn from the environ
and not convers neither prevent the system from becom more intellig than the
environ nor doe it prevent the environ learn from the system becaus the
environ can itself interpret the output yk as a regular and a credit part the environ is just not forc to learn wherea the system is in case where we restrict the
credit to two valu c c ib 0 1 c 1 is interpret as a posit feedback call
good or correct and c 0 a neg feedback call bad or error in the follow further
let us restrict for a while the lifetim number of cycl t of the system to a larg but
finit valu let ckmp q m
ik cxi be the total credit the system p receiv from the
environ q in the cycl k to m it is now natur to call the system which maxim
the total credit c1t call util the best or most intellig one3
ptq maxarg c1t p q
p
ckt ptq q ckt p q p
for k 1 thi is obviou and for k 1 easi to see if t y and x are finit the number of
differ behaviour of the system ie the search space is finit therefor becaus we
have assum that q is known ptq can effect be determin by preanalyz all
behaviour the main reason for restrict to finit t wa not to ensur comput of
ptq but that the limit t might not exist thi is noth special the unrealist
assumpt of a complet known determinist environ q ha simpli trivial
everyth

maxargp cp is the p which maxim c if there is more than one maximum we might choos
the lexicograph smallest one for definit
2 the ai model in function form
9
ai model for known prior probabl let us now weaken our assumpt by
replac the environ q with a probabl distribut q over chronolog function might be interpret in two way either the environ itself behav in a
probabilist way defin by or the true environ is determinist but we onli have
probabilist inform of which environ be the true environ combin of both case are also possibl the interpret doe not matter in the follow
we just assum that we know but no more about the environ whatev the interpret may be
let us assum we are in cycl k with histori y
x1 y
xk1 and ask for the best output yk
further let qk q qy k x k be the set of all environ produc the abov
histori the expect credit for the next mk1 cycl given the abov histori is given
by a condit probabl
ckm

we cannot simpli determin maxargp c1t unlik the determinist case becaus the
histori is no longer determinist determin by p and q but depend on p and
and on the outcom of a stochast process everi new cycl add new inform x i
to the system thi is indic by the dot over the symbol in cycl k we have to
maxim the expect futur credit take into account the inform in the histori
xk thi inform is not alreadi present in p and q at the system start unlik in
y
the determinist case
further we want to gener the finit lifetim t to a dynam comput farsighted hk mk k1 1 call horizon in the follow for mk t we have our origin
finit lifetim for mk km1 the system maxim in everi cycl the next m expect
credit a discuss of the choic mk is delay to section 4
the next hk credit are maxim by
pk maxarg ckm
py
xk

pp k
where pk p px k yk is the set of system consist with the current histori
pk depend on k and is use onli in step k to determin y k by pk x k y k y k y k after
write y k the environ repli with x k with condit probabl q k1q k
thi probabilist outcom provid new inform to the system the cycl k1 start
with determin y k1 from pk1 which differ from pk as x k is now fix and so on
note that pk depend also on yk becaus pk and q k do so but recurs insert pk1
and so on we can defin
p x k pk x k pk1 x k1 p1
2
it is a chronolog function and comput if x y and mk are finit the polici p
defin our ai model for deterministic4 thi model reduc to the determinist case
4
we call a probabl distribut determinist if it is 1 for exactli one argument and 0 for all other
2 the ai model in function form
10
it is import to maxim the sum of futur credit and not for instanc to be greedi
and onli maxim the next credit as is done eg in sequenc predict for exampl
let the environ be a sequenc of chess game and each cycl correspond to one move
onli at the end of each game a posit credit c 1 is given to the system if it won the
game and made no illeg move for the system maxim all futur credit mean
tri to win as mani game in as short as possibl time and avoid illeg move
the same perform is reach if we choos mk k m with m much larger than the
typic game length maxim of onli the next credit would be a veri bad chess
play system even if we would make our credit c finer eg by evalu the number
of chessmen the system would play veri bad chess for m 1 inde
the ai model still depend on and mk mk is address in section 4 to get our final
univers ai model the idea is to replac by the univers probabl defin later
thi is motiv by the fact that in a certain sens for ani with instead of
our model no longer depend on ani paramet so it is truli univers it remain to
show that it produc intellig output but let us continu step by step in the next
section we develop an altern but equival formul of the ai model given abov
wherea the function form is more suitabl for theoret consider especi for
the develop of a timebound version in section 10 the iter formul of the
next section will be more appropri for the explicit calcul in most of the other
section

the ai model in recurs and iter form
probabl distribut throughout the paper we deal with sequencesstr and
condit probabl distribut on string some notat are therefor appropri
we use greek letter for probabl distribut and underlin their argument to indic that they are probabl argument let n x1 xn be the probabl that a string
start with x1 xn we onli consid suffici long string so the n are normal to
1 moreov we drop the index on if it is clear from it argument
xn x

n x1n n1 xn xn

we also need condit probabl deriv from bay rule we prefer a notat
which preserv the chronolog order of the word in contrast to the standard notat
which flip it we extend the definit of to the condit case with the follow
convent for it argument an underlin argument xk is a probabl variabl and
other nonunderlin argument xk repres condit with thi convent bay
rule ha the form xn xn x1n xn the equat state that the probabl
that a string x1 xn1 is follow by xn is equal to the probabl of x1 xn divid by
the probabl of x1 xn1 we use x as a shortcut for string start with x
the introduc notat is also suitabl for defin the condit probabl
y1 x1 yn xn that the environ react with x1 xn under the condit that the output of the system is y1 yn the environ is chronolog ie input xi depend
on yxi yi onli in the probabilist case thi mean that yxk yk xk yx1k is independ of yk henc a tail yk in the argument of can be drop probabl
distribut with thi properti will be call chronolog the y are alway condit
ie never underlin wherea addit condit for the x can be obtain with
bay rule
yxn yxn yx1n yxn and

yx1n yx1 yx1yx2 yxn yxn
the second equat is the first equat appli n time
altern formul of the ai model let us defin the ai model p in
a differ way in the next subsect we will show that the p model defin here is
ident to the function definit of p given in the last section
let yx1k be the true chronolog prior probabl that the environ react with
x1k if provid with action y1k from the system we assum the cybernet model
depict on page 7 to be valid next we defin ck1m
yx1k to be the expect credit
sum in cycl k 1 to m with output yi gener by system p and past respons xi
from the environ ad cxk we get the credit includ cycl k the probabl
of xk given yxk yk is given by the condit probabl yxk yxk so the expect
credit sum in cycl k to m given yxk yk is
cxk ck1m
yx1k yxk yxk

now we ask about how p choos yk it should choos yk as to maxim the futur
credit so the expect number of error in cycl k to m given yxk and yk chosen by p
is ckm
yxk maxyk ckm
yxk yk togeth with the induct start

ckm is complet defin we might summar one cycl into the formula

then the environ respond x k with probabl y

thi ha a direct interpret the probabl of input xkmk in cycl k when the system
output ykmk and the actual histori is y
xk is y
xk yxkmk the futur credit in thi
case is cxk cxmk the best expect credit is obtain by averag over the
xi sumxi and maxim over the yi thi ha to be done in chronolog order to
correctli incorpor the depend of xi and yi on the histori thi is essenti the
expectimax algorithmsequ 25 31 the ai model is optim in the sens that no
other polici lead to higher expect credit
these explicit as well as recurs definit of the ai model are more index intens
as compar to the function form but are more suitabl for explicit calcul

mk thi mean that for factoriz there is no problem in take the limit mk
mayb thi limit can also be perform in the more gener case of a separ the
problem of the choic of mk will be discuss in more detail later
although factoriz are too restrict to cover all ai problem it often occur in
practic in the form of repeat problem solv and henc is worth be studi for
exampl if the system ha to play game like chess repeatedli or ha to minim differ function the differ gamesfunct might be complet independ ie the
environment probabl factor where each factor correspond to a gamefunct
minim for detail see the appropri section on strateg game and function
minim
further for factoriz it is probabl easier to deriv suitabl credit bound for the
univers ai model defin in the next section than for the gener separ case which
will be introduc later thi could be a first step toward a definit and proof for the
gener case of separ problem one goal of thi paragraph wa to show that the
notion of a factoriz could be the first step toward a definit and analysi of the
gener case of separ
constant and limit we have in mind a univers system with complex interact
that is as least as intellig and complex as a human be one might think of a system

cycl of the system is far too small to allow everi possibl input to occur or to tri
everi possibl output or to make use of ident repeat input or output we do
not expect ani use output for k l more interest than the length of the input
is the complex kx1 xk of all input until now to be defin later the environ
is usual not perfect the system could either interact with a nonperfect human or
tackl a nondeterminist world due to quantum mechan or chao world7 in either
case the sequenc contain some nois lead to k l k the complex of the
probabl distribut of the input sequenc is someth differ we assum that

in the follow we never use these limit except when explicitli state in some simpler

note that despit of thi formal equival we were forc to use the complet histori

nontrivi aspect of intellig is induct infer befor formul the ai model
a short introduct to the histori of induct is given culmin into the sequenc
predict theori by solomonoff we emphas onli those aspect which will be of
import for the develop of our univers ai model
simpli speak induct is the process of predict the futur from the past or more
precis it is the process of find rule in past data and use these rule to guess
futur data on the one hand induct seem to happen in everi day life by find
regular in past observ and use them to predict the futur on the other hand
thi procedur seem to add knowledg about the futur from past observ but how
can we know someth about the futur thi dilemma and the induct principl in

in the rest of thi subsect we state all result which are need or gener later

to a probabl distribut and that the true prior probabl of x1n is x1 xn
the probabl of xn given xn henc is xn xn the best possibl system predict
the xn with higher probabl usual is unknown and the system can onli have
some belief about the true prior probabl let sp be a probabilist sequenc
predictor predict xn with probabl xn xn further we defin a determinist
sequenc predictor sp predict the xn with higher probabl xn xn 1 if
xn xn 21 and xn xn 0 otherwis if is onli a semimeasur the sp and
sp system might refus ani output in some cycl n the sp is the best predict

if xn xn converg quickli to xn xn the number of addit predict error

definit of the ai model we have develop enough formal to suggest our
univers ai model9 all we have to do is to suitabl gener the univers semimeasur
from the last subsect and replac the true but unknown prior probabl ai in the

discuss later
in the function formul we defin the univers probabl ai of an environ q

4 the univers ai model
20
note that the sum on the lh is not independ of yn unlik for chronolog probabl
distribut nevertheless it is bound by someth the rh which is independ of
yn the reason is that the sum in 24 run over partial recurs chronolog function
onli and the function q which satisfi qy1n xn are a subset of the function satisfi qyn xn therefor we will in gener call function satisfi 26 chronolog
semimeasur the import point is that the condit probabl 4 are 1 like
for true probabl distribut
the equival of the function and iter ai model proven in section 3 is true for
everi chronolog semimeasur esp for henc we can talk about the ai model
in thi respect it slightli depend on the choic of univers ture machin lq is
defin onli up to an addit constant it also depend on the choic of x c x
and y but we do not expect ani bia when the space are chosen suffici simpl eg
all string of length 216 choos in as word space would be optim but whether the
maxima suprema exist in thi case ha to be shown beforehand the onli nontrivi
depend is on the horizon function mk which will be discuss later so apart from mk
and unimport detail the ai system is uniqu defin by 23 or 25 it doesnt
depend on assumpt about the environ apart from be gener from some
comput but unknown probabl distribut
univers of ai in which sens the ai model is optim will be clarifi later
in thi and the next two subsect we show that ai defin in 24 is univers and
converg to ai analog to the sp case 19 and 20 the proof are gener from
the sp case the y are pure spectat and caus no difficulti in the gener the
replac of the binari alphabet ib use in sp by the possibl infinit alphabet x
is possibl but need to be done with care in 19 up x produc string start
with x wherea in 24 we can demand q to output exactli n word x1n as q know n
from the number of input word y1 yn for proof of 19 and 20 see 36 and 22
there is an altern definit of which coincid with 24 within a multipl

where the sum run over all enumer chronolog semimeasur the 2k weight

that an enumer of all enumer function can be convert into an enumer of
enumer chronolog semimeasur k is coenumer therefor defin in
27 is itself enumer the represent 24 is also enumer as 2k 1

thi in turn show that yxk yxk converg to yxk yxk for k with probabl

converg to yxk yxkkr more gener in case of a bound horizon hk it follow
that

37
thi give make us confid that the output y k of the ai model 25 could converg
to the output yk from the ai model 9 at least for bound horizon
we want to call an ai model univers if it is independ unbias modelfre and
is abl to solv ani solvabl problem and learn ani learnabl task further we call a
univers model univers optim if there is no program which can solv or learn
significantli faster in term of interact cycl as the ai model is parameterless
converg to 37 the ai model is itself optim and we expect no other model to
converg faster to ai by analog to sp 22
we expect ai to be univers optim
thi is our main claim in a sens the intent of the remain subsect is to

proof that is a reliabl intellig order what we believ to be true would prove that
ai is univers optim we could further ask how use is
for order polici
of practic interest with intermedi intellig or how can
help to guid toward
construct more intellig system with reason comput time an effect
intellig order relat c will be defin in section 10 which is more use from a
practic point of view
credit bound and separ concept the credit ckm associ with the ai
system correspond roughli to the neg error measur en of the sp system in sp
we were interest in small bound for the error excess en en unfortun simpl
credit bound for ai in term of ckm analog to the error bound 22 do not hold we
even have difficulti in specifi what we can expect to hold for ai or ani ai system
which claim to be univers optim consequ we cannot have a proof if we dont
know what to prove in sp the onli import properti of for prove error bound
wa it complex k we will see that in the ai case there are no use bound in
term of k onli we either have to studi restrict problem class or consid bound
depend on other properti of rather than on it complex onli in the follow
we will exhibit the difficulti by two exampl and introduc concept which may be
use for prove credit bound despit the difficulti in even claim use credit
bound we nevertheless firmli believ that the order relat 39 correctli formal the
intuit mean of intellig and henc that the ai system is univers optim
in the follow we choos mk t we want to compar the true ie expect credit
c1t
of a independ univers polici pbest with ani other polici p naiv we might
apart from addit correct
expect the exist of a polici pbest which maxim c1t
of lower order for t
c1t
pbest c1t
p o p
40
note that the polici p of the ai system maxim c1t
by definit p p as c1t
is thought to be a guess of c1t
we might expect pbest p to approxim maxim
c1t ie 40 to hold let us consid the problem class set of environ 0 1
with y c 0 1 and ck iy1 in environ i the first output y1 decid whether
you go to heaven with all futur credit ck be 1 good or to hell with all futur credit
be 0 bad it is clear that if i ie i is known the optim polici pi is to output
y1 i in the first cycl with c1t
pi t on the other hand ani unbias polici pbest
independ of the actual either output y1 1 or y1 0 independ of the actual
choic y1 there is alway an environ 1y1 for which thi choic is catastroph
pbest 0 no singl system can perform well in both environ 0 and 1 the
c1t
rh of 40 equal tot for p p for all pbest there is a for which the lh is zero
we have shown that no pbest can satisfi 40 for all and p so we cannot expect p to
do so nevertheless there are problem class for which 40 hold for instanc sp and
cf for sp 40 is just a reformul of 22 with an appropri choic for pbest which
differ from p see next section we expect 40 to hold for all induct problem in
4 the univers ai model
25
which the environ is not influenced14 by the output of the system we want to call
these passiv or induct environ further we want to call satisfi 40 with
pbest p pseudo passiv so we expect induct to be pseudo passiv
let us give a further exampl to demonstr the difficulti in establish credit bound
let c 0 1 and y be larg we consid all determinist environ in which a
singl complex output y is correct c 1 and all other are wrong c 0 the problem
class m is defin by
m yxk yk 1 yk y y y ky log2 y
there are n y such y the onli way a independ polici p can find the correct
y is by tri one y after the other in a certain order in the first n 1 cycl at
most n 1 differ y are test as there are n differ possibl y there is alway
a m for which p give erron output in the first n 1 cycl the number of
error are ep n 1 y 2ki 2k for thi as thi is true for ani p it is
also true for the ai model henc ek 2k is the best possibl error bound we can
expect which depend on k onli actual we will deriv such a bound in section 5
for sp unfortun as we are mainli interest in the cycl region k y 2k
see section 3 thi bound is trivial there are no interest bound depend on k
onli unlik the sp case for determinist bound must either depend on addit
properti of or we have to consid special bound for restrict problem class
the case of probabilist is similar wherea for sp there are use bound in term of
ek and k there are no such bound for ai again thi is not a drawback of ai
sinc for no unbias ai system the errorscredit could be bound in term of k and
the errorscredit of ai onli
there is a way to make use of gross eg 2k bound assum that after a reason
number of cycl k the inform x k perceiv by the ai system contain a lot of
inform about the true environ the inform in x k might be code in
ani form let us assum that the complex kx k of under the condit that
x k is known is of order 1 consid a theorem bound the sum of credit or of other
quantiti over cycl 1 in term of f k for a function f with f o1 o1 like
f n 2n then there will be a bound for cycl k in term of f kx k o1
henc a bound like 2k can be replac by small bound 2kx k o1 after a reason number of cycl all one ha to showensureassum is that enough inform
about is present in ani form in the first k cycl in thi way even a gross bound
could becom use in section 8 we use a similar argument to prove that ai is abl to
learn supervis
in the follow we weaken 40 in the hope of get a bound applic to wider
problem class than the passiv one consid the io sequenc y 1 x 1 yn x n caus by
xk ai will output y k yk in cycl k let us compar thi to y k what
ai on histori y
ai would output still on the same histori y
xk produc by ai as ai maxim
14
of cours the credit feedback ck depend on the system output what we have in mind is like in
sequenc predict that the true sequenc is not influenc by the system
4 the univers ai model
26
the expect credit ai caus lower or at best equal ckm
if y k differ from y k let
k
n
dn
k1 1 y k y k be the expect number of suboptim choic of ai ie
output differ from ai in the first n cycl one might weigh the deviat case by
their sever especi when the expect credit ckm
for y k and y k are equal or
k
close to each other thi should be taken into account in the definit of dn these
detail do not matter in the follow qualit discuss the import differ
to 40 is that here we stick on the histori produc by ai and count a wrong decis
as at most one error the wrong decis in the heavenhel exampl in the first cycl
no longer count as lose t credit but count as one wrong decis in a sens thi
is fairer one shouldnt blame somebodi too much who make a singl wrong decis
for which he just ha too littl inform avail in order to make a correct decis
the ai model would deserv to be call asymptot optim if the probabl of
make a wrong decis tend to zero ie if
dn n 0 for n
ie dn on
41
we say that can be asymptot learn by ai if 41 is satisfi we claim
that ai for mk can asymptot learn everi problem of relev ie ai
is asymptot optim we includ the qualifi of relev as we are not sure
whether there could be strang spoil 41 but we expect those to be irrelev
from the perspect of ai in the field of learn there are mani asymptot learnabl
theorem often not too difficult to prove so a proof of 41 might also be access
unfortun asymptot learnabl theorem are often too weak to be use from a
practic point nevertheless they point in the right direct
from the converg 37 of we might expect ckm

that if the ckmk for the differ choic of yk are nearli equal then even if ckm

in the follow we briefli mention some further concept a markovian is defin

prove elsewher further we say is farsight if limmk yk k exist more detail
will be given in the next subsect where we also give an exampl of a possibl relev
which is not farsight
we have introduc sever concept which might be use for prove credit bound
includ forget relev asymptot learnabl farsight uniform gener
markovian factoriz and pseudo passiv we have sort them here approxim
in the order of decreas gener we want to call them separ concept the more
gener like relev asymptot learnabl and farsight will be call weakli
separ the more restrict like pseudo passiv and factoriz will be call
strongli separ but we will use these qualifi in a more qualit rather than rigid
sens other nonsepar concept are determinist and of cours the class of
all chronolog
the choic of the horizon the onli signific arbitrari in the ai model lie
in the choic of the horizon function hk mk k1 we discuss some choic which seem
to be natur and give preliminari conclus at the end we will not discuss ad hoc
choic of hk for specif problem like the discuss in section 6 in the context of finit
game we are interest in univers choic of mk
if the lifetim of the system is known to be t which is in practic alway larg but finit
then the choic mk t maxim correctli the expect futur credit t is usual not
known in advanc as in mani case the time we are will to run a system depend
on the qualiti of it output for thi reason it is often desir that good output
are not delay too much if thi result in a margin credit increas onli thi can be
incorpor by damp the futur credit if for instanc we assum that the surviv
of the system in each cycl is proport to the past credit an exponenti damp
ck ck ek is appropri where ck are bound eg ck 0 1 the express 25
converg for mk in thi case but thi doe not solv the problem as we introduc
a new arbitrari timescal 1 everi damp introduc a timescal
even the timescal invari damp factor k introduc a dynam timescal in
cycl k the contribut of cycl 21k is damp by a factor 21 the effect horizon hk in
thi case is k the choic hk k with 21 qualit model the same behaviour
we have not introduc an arbitrari timescal t but limit the farsighted to some
multipl or fraction of the length of the current histori thi avoid the preselect
of a global timescal t or 1 thi choic ha some appeal as it seem that human
of age k year usual do not plan their live for more than perhap the next k year
human 1 from a practic point of view thi model might serv all need but from
a theoret point we feel uncomfort with such a limit in the horizon from the
veri begin note that we have to choos o1 becaus otherwis we would again
introduc a number which ha to be justifi
the naiv limit mk in 25 may turn out to be well defin and the previou discuss
superflu in the follow we defin a limit which is alway well defin for finit y

would correspond to the

lime inferior limm yk yk is uniqu ie yk 1 iff the naiv limit limm y k
exist note that the limit limm ckm
yxk need not to exist for thi construct
the construct abov lead to a mathemat eleg noparamet ai model unfortun thi is not the end of the stori the limit mk can caus undesir
result in the ai model for special which might also happen in the ai model whatev we defin mk consid y c 0 1 and x output yk 0 shall give
credit ck 0 output yk 1 shall give ck 1 iff y kll ykl 00 for some l ie the
system can achiev l consecut posit credit if there wa a sequenc of length at least
l with yk ck 0 if the lifetim of the ai system is t it output yk 0 in the first
r cycl and then y k 1 for the remain r 2 cycl with r such that r r 2 t thi
will lead to the highest possibl total credit c1t t 14 12 ani fragment of
the 0 and 1 sequenc would reduc thi for t the ai system can and will delay
the point r of switch to y k 1 indefinit and alway output 0 with total credit 0
obvious the worst possibl behaviour the ai system will explor the abov rule after
a while of tri yk 01 and then appli the same behaviour as the ai system sinc
the simplest rule cover past data domin for finit t thi is exactli what we
want but for infinit t the ai model fail just as the ai model doe the good point
is that thi is not a weak of the ai model as ai fail too and no system can be
better than ai the bad point is that mk ha far reach consequ even when
start from an alreadi veri larg mk t the reason be that the of thi exampl
is highli nonloc in time ie it may violat one of our weak separ condit
in the last paragraph we have consid the consequ of mk in the ai model
we now consid whether the ai model is a good approxim of the ai model for
larg mk anoth object against too larg choic of mk is that yxk yxkmk ha
been prove to be a good approxim of yxk yxkmk onli for k hk which is never
satisfi for mk t or mk we have seen that for factoriz the limit hk
caus no problem as from a certain hk on the output y k is independ of hk as
for bound hk will develop thi separ properti too so from a certain k0 on
the limit hk might also be safe for therefor take the limit from the veri
begin worsen the behaviour of ai mayb onli for finit mani cycl k k0 which
would be accept we suppos that the valuat ck for k k where can no
longer be trust as a good approxim to are in some sens randomli disturb
with decreas influenc on the choic of y k thi claim is support by the forget
properti of
we are not sure whether the choic of mk is of margin import as long as mk is
16
chosen suffici larg and of low complex mk 22 for instanc or whether the
choic of mk will turn out to be a central topic for the ai model or for the plan
aspect of ani ai system in gener we suppos that the limit mk for the ai model
4 the univers ai model
29
result in correct behaviour for weakli separ and that even the naiv limit exist
but to prove thi would probabl give interest insight
5 sequenc predict sp

sequenc predict sp
we have introduc the ai model as a unif of the idea of decis theori and
univers probabl distribut we might expect ai to behav ident to sp
when face with a sequenc predict problem but thing are not that simpl as we will
see
use the ai model for sequenc predict we have seen in the last section
how to predict sequenc for known and unknown prior distribut sp here we consid
binari sequences15 z1 z2 z3 ib with known prior probabl sp z1 z2 z3
we want to show how the ai model can be use for sequenc predict we will see
that it give the same predict as the sp system first we have to specifi how the
ai model should be use for sequenc predict the follow choic is natur
the system output yk is interpret as a predict for the k th bit zk of the string which
ha to be predict thi mean that yk is binari yk ib y as a reaction of the
environ the system receiv credit ck 1 if the predict wa correct yk zk or
ck 0 if the predict wa erron yk zk the question is what the input xk of the
next cycl should be one choic would be to inform the system about the correct k th bit
of the last cycl of the string and set xk zk but as from the credit ck in conjunct with
the predict yk the true bit zk yk ck can be infer thi inform is redund
is the kroneck symbol defin as ab 1 for a b and 0 otherwis there is no
need for thi addit feedback so we set xk x thu have xk ck the
system perform doe not chang when we includ thi redund inform it
mere complic the notat the prior probabl ai of the ai model is
ai y1 x1 yk xk ai y1 c1 yk ck sp y1 c1 yk ck sp z1 zk
43
in the follow we will drop the superscript of becaus they are clear from the

the formula 7 for the expect credit reduc to

yx1k y1c1 yk1 ck1 yk ck

the first observ we can make is that for thi special ckm
onli depend on yi ci ie
replac yi and ci simultan with their complement doe not chang the valu of
ckm
we have a symmetri in yi ci for k m1 thi is definit true as cm1m
0 in thi
case see 6 for k m we prove it by induct the rh of 44 is symmetr in yi ci for
i k becaus possess thi symmetri and ck1m
possess it by induct hypothesi
so the symmetri hold for the lh which complet the proof the predict y k is

we have insert 5 which give the rh of 44 with maxyk replac by maxargyk
c f yc is independ of y for ani function depend on the combin yc onli
as well as depend on
therefor the c c term is independ of yk becaus ck1m
yk ck onli in the third equat we can therefor drop thi term as ad a constant to
the argument of maxargyk doe not chang the locat of the maximum in the second
last equat we evalu the ck further if the true credit to yi is ci the true ith bit
of the string must be zi yi ci the last equat is just a renam
so the ai model predict that zk that ha maxim probabl given z1 zk1 thi
predict is independ of the choic of mk it is exactli the predict scheme of the
determinist sequenc predict with known prior sp describ in the last section
as thi model wa optim ai is optim too ie ha minim number of expect
error maxim expect credit as compar to ani other sequenc predict scheme
from thi it is alreadi clear that the total expect credit ckm must be relat to the
expect sequenc predict error em 21 let us prove directli that c1m em
m we rewrit ckm
in 44 as a function of zi instead of yi ci as it is symmetr in yici
further we can pull ckm

5 sequenc predict sp
32
use the ai model for sequenc predict now we want to use the univers
ai model instead of ai for sequenc predict and tri to deriv error bound analog to
22 like in the ai case the system output yk in cycl k is interpret as a predict
for the kth bit zk of the string which ha to be predict the credit is ck yk zk and
there are no other input xk what make the analysi more difficult is that is
not symmetr in yi ci 1 yi 1 ci and 43 doe not hold for on the other
hand ai converg to ai in the limit 37 and 43 should hold asymptot for
in some sens so we expect that everyth proven for ai hold approxim for ai
the ai model should behav similarli to sp the determinist variant of solomonoff
predict especi we expect error bound similar to 22 make thi rigor seem
difficult some gener remark have been made in the last section
here we concentr on the special case of a determinist comput environ ie
the environ is a sequenc z z1 z2 kz1 zn kz
furthermor we onli
consid the simplest horizon model mk k ie maxim onli the next credit thi is
suffici for sequenc predict as the credit of cycl k onli depend on output yk and
not on earlier decis thi choic is in no way suffici and satisfactori for the full
ai model as one singl choic of mk should serv for all ai problem class so ai
should allow good sequenc predict for some univers choic of mk and not onli for
mk k which definit doe not suffic for more complic ai problem the analysi
of thi gener case is a challeng for the futur for mk k the ai model 25 with

the environment respons ck is given by yk zk it is 1 for a correct predict y k zk
and 0 otherwis in the follow we want to bound the number of error thi predict
scheme make we need the follow inequ
yc1 yck 2ky1c1 yk ck o1
49
we have to find a short program in the sum 24 calcul c1 ck from y1 yk if we
knew zi yi ci for 1 i k a program of size o1 could calcul c1 ck y1 z1 yk zk
so combin thi program with a shortest code of z1 zk lead to a program of size
kz1 zk o1 which prove 49
let us now assum that we make a wrong predict in cycl k ie ck 0 yk zk the
goal is to show that defin by

in the first inequ we have use the fact that y k maxim by definit 48 the
argument ie 1 y k ha lower probabl than y k 49 ha been appli in the second
inequ the equal hold becaus zi yi ci and 1yk 1 yk 0 yk ck zk the last
inequ follow from the definit of z
we have shown that each erron predict reduc by at least the defin abov
togeth with 0 1 and k 0 for all k thi show that the system can make at most 1
error sinc otherwis k would becom neg so the number of wrong predict
ai

of system 48 is bound by

50
for a comput determinist environ string z1 z2 the intuit interpret is
that each wrong predict elimin at least one program p of size lp kz
the
size is smaller than kz
as larger polici could not mislead the system to a wrong
predict sinc there is a program of size kz
make a correct predict there are
kzo1
such polici which bound the total number of error
at most 2
ai
we have deriv a finit bound for en
but unfortun a rather weak one as compar
to 22 the reason for the strong bound in the sp case wa that everi error at least
halv becaus the sum of the maxargxk argument wa 1 here we have
y 1c1 y k1ck1 00 y 1c1 y k1ck1 01 1
y 1c1 y k1ck1 10 y 1c1 y k1ck1 11 1
but maxargyk run over the right top and right bottom for which no sum criterion
hold
the ai model would not be suffici for realist applic if the bound 50 were
sharp but we have the strong feel but onli weak argument that better bound proport to kz
analog to 22 exist the techniqu use abov may not be appropri
for achiev thi one argument for a better bound is the formal similar between
maxargzk zk zk and 48 the other is that we were unabl to construct an exampl
sequenc for which 48 make more than okz

introduct a veri import class of problem are strateg game like chess in
fact what is subsum under game theori nowaday is so gener that it includ not

strategi like backgammon up to pure strateg game like chess or checker or go
game theori can also describ polit and econom competit and coalit even
darwin and mani more have been model within game theori it seem that nearli
everi ai problem could be brought into the form of a game nevertheless the intent of
a game is that sever player perform some action with partial observ consequ
the goal of each player is to maxim some util function eg to win the game the
player are assum to be ration take into account all inform they poss the
differ goal of the player are usual in conflict for an introduct into game theori
see 10 26 31 40
if we interpret the ai system as one player and the environ model the other ration player and the environ provid the reinforc feedback ck we see that the

know that the ai system can handl more gener situat sinc it interact optim

strictli competit strateg game in the follow we restrict ourselv to determinist strictli competit strategic16 game with altern move player 1 make

of a sequenc of altern move y1 x1 y2 x2 yn xn at the end of the game in cycl n the
game or final board state is evalu with cy1 x1 yn xn player 1 tri to maxim

game c 1 if player 2 won and c 0 for a draw we assum a fix game length n

game of variabl length in the unrep case we have argu that game of
variabl but bound length can be pad to a fix length without effect we now
analyz in a sequenc of game the effect of replac the game with fix length by
game of variabl length the sequenc y1 x1 yn xn can still be group into episod
correspond to the move of separ consecut game but now the length and
total number of game that fit into the n move depend on the actual move taken17
cy1 x1 yn xn equal the number of game where the system win minu the number of
game where the environ win whenev a loss win or draw ha been achiev by
the system or the environ a new game start the player whose turn it would next
be begin the next game the game are still separ in the sens that the behaviour
and credit of the current game doe not influenc the next game on the other hand
they are slightli entangl becaus the length of the current game determin the time
of start of the next as the rule of the game are time invari thi doe not influenc
the next game directli if we play a fix number of game the game are complet
independ but if we play a fix number of total move n the number of game depend
on their length thi ha the follow consequ the better player tri to keep the
game short to win more game in the given time n the poorer player tri to draw
the game out in order loos less game the better player might further prefer a quick
draw rather than to win a long game formal thi entangl is repres by the
fact that the prior probabl doe no longer factor the reduc form 57 of y kai
to one episod is no longer valid also the behaviour ykai of the system depend on mk
even if the horizon hk is chosen larger than the longest possibl game unless mk n
the import point is that the system realiz that keep game shortlong can lead to
increas credit in practic a horizon much larger than the averag game length should
be suffici to incorpor thi effect the detail of game in the distant futur do not
affect the current game and can therefor be ignor a more quantit analysi could
be interest but would lead us too far astray
use the ai model for game play when go from the specif ai model
where the rule of the game have been explicitli model into the prior probabl ai

assign credit ck here anoth actual the main reason for studi the case of
repeat game rather than just one game aris for a singl game there is onli one
cycl of nontrivi feedback name the end of the game too late to be use except
when there are further game follow
even in the case of repeat game there is onli veri limit feedback at most log2 3 bit
of inform per game if the 3 outcom winlossdraw have the same frequenc so
there are at least okgam number of game necessari to learn a game of complex
kgame apart from extrem simpl game even thi estim is far too optimist
as the ai system ha no inform about the game to begin with it move will be
more or less random and it can win the first few game mere by pure luck so the
probabl that the system loos is near to one and henc the inform content i in
the feedback ck at the end of the game is much less than log2 3 thi situat remain
for a veri larg number of game on the other hand in principl everi game should be
learnabl after a veri long sequenc of game even with thi minim feedback onli as
long as i 0
the import point is that no other learn scheme with no extra inform can learn
the game more quickli we expect thi to be true as ai factor in the case of game of
fix length ie ai satisfi a strong separ condit in the case of variabl game
length the entangl is also low ai should still be suffici separ allow to
formul and prove good credit bound for ai
to learn realist game like tictacto nought and cross in realist time one ha to
provid more feedback thi could be achiev by intermedi help dure the game the
environ could give positiveneg feedback for everi goodbad move the system
make the demand on whether a move is to be valu as good should be adopt to the
gain experi of the system in such a way that approxim half of the move are
valuat as good and the other half as bad in order to maxim the inform content
of the feedback
for more complic game like chess even more feedback is necessari from a practic
point of view one way to increas the feedback far beyond a few bit per cycl is to train
the system by teach it good move thi is call supervis learn despit the fact
that the ai model ha onli a credit feedback ck it is abl to learn by teach as will be
shown in section 8 anoth way would be to start with more simpl game contain
certain aspect of the true game and to switch to the true game when the system ha
learn the simpl game
no other difficulti are expect when go from to eventu ai will converg
to the minimax strategi ai in the more realist case where the environ is not a
perfect minimax player ai can detect and exploit the weak of the oppon
final we want to comment on the inputoutput space xy of the ai system in
practic applic y will possibl includ also illeg move if y is the set of move
of eg a robot arm the system could move a wrong figur or even knock over the figur
a simpl way to handl illeg move yk is by interpret them as lose move which
termin the game further if eg the input xk is the imag of a video camera which

make one shot per move x is not the set of move by the environ but includ the
set of state of the game board the discuss in thi section handl thi case as well
there is no need to explicitli design the system io space xy for a specif game
the discuss abov on the ai system wa rather inform for the follow reason
game play the sg system ha nearli the same complex as fulli gener ai and
quantit result for the ai system are difficult but not imposs to obtain

function minim fm
applicationsexampl there are mani problem that can be reduc to a minim problem fm the minimum of a real valu function f y ir over some
domain y or a good approxim of it ha to be found usual with some limit resourc
one popular exampl is the travel salesman problem tsp y is the set of differ
rout between town and f y the length of rout y y the task is to find a rout of
minim length visit all citi thi problem is np hard get good approxim
in limit time is of great import in variou applic anoth exampl is the
minim of product cost mpc eg of a car under sever constraint y
is the set of all altern car design and product method compat with the
specif and f y the overal cost of altern y y a relat exampl is find
materi or biomolecul with certain properti mat eg solid with minim
electr resist or maxim effici chlorophyl modif or aromat molecul
that tast as close as possibl to strawberryw can also ask for nice paint npt y
is the set of all exist or imagin paint and f y character how much person
a like paint y the system should present paint which a like
for now these are enough exampl the tsp is veri rigor from a mathemat
point of view as f ie an algorithm of f is usual known in principl the minimum
could be found by extens search were it not for comput resourc limit
for mpc f can often be model in a reliabl and suffici accur way for mat
you need veri accur physic model which might be unavail or too difficult to
solv or implement for npt the most we have is the judgement of person a on everi
present paint the evalu function f cannot be implement without scan
a s brain which is not possibl with today technolog
so there are differ limit some depend on the applic we have in mind
an implement of f might not be avail f can onli be test at some argument y
and f y is determin by the environ we want to approxim minim f with
as few function call as possibl or convers find an as close as possibl approxim
for the minimum within a fix number of function evalu if f is avail or can
quickli be infer by the system and evalu is quick it is more import to minim
the total time need to imagin new trial minimum candid plu the evalu time
for f as we do not consid comput aspect of ai till section 10 we concentr
on the first case where f is not avail or domin the comput requir
the greedi model fmg the fm model consist of a sequenc y1 z1 y2 z2 where
y k is a trial of the fm system for a minimum of f and zk f y k is the true function
valu return by the environ we random the model by assum a probabl
distribut f over the function there are sever reason for do thi we might
realli not know the exact function f as in the npt exampl and model our uncertainti
by the probabl distribut more importantli we want to parallel the other ai
class like in the sp model where we alway start with a probabl distribut
7 function minim fm

that wa final replac by to get the univers solomonoff predict sp we want to
do the same thing here further the probabilist case includ the determinist case by
choos f f f0 where f0 is the true function a final reason is that the determinist
case is trivial when and henc f0 is known as the system can intern virtual check
all function argument and output the correct minimum from the veri begin
we will assum that y is countabl or finit and that is a discret measur eg by
take onli comput function the probabl that the function valu of y1 yn

therefor y1 0 as minarg is defin to take the lexicograph first minimum in an

for y2 0 the system alreadi know f 0 2 for y2 1 the expect is again the
arithmet averag the system will again output y2 0 with feedback z2 2 thi will
continu forev the system is not motiv to explor other y s as f 0 is alreadi
smaller than the expect of f 1 thi is obvious not what we want the greedi
model fail the system ought to be invent and tri other output when given enough
time
the gener reason for the failur of the greedi approach is that the inform contain
in the feedback zk depend on the output yk a fm system can activ influenc the
knowledg it receiv from the environ by the choic in yk it may be more advantag to first collect certain knowledg about f by an in greedi sens nonoptim choic
for yk rather than to minim the zk expect immedi the nonminim of
zk might be overcompens in the long run by exploit thi knowledg in sp the
receiv inform is alway the current bit of the sequenc independ of what sp
predict for thi bit thi is the reason whi a greedi strategi in the sp case is alreadi

the gener fm model to get a use model we have to think more care
about what we realli want should the fm system output a good minimum in the last
output in a limit number of cycl t or should the averag of the z1 zt valu be
minim or doe it suffic that just one of the z is as small as possibl let us defin the
fm model as to minim the averag weight sum 1 z1 t zt for some given

if we want the final output y t to be optim we should choos k 0 for k t and

in some averag sens so we should choos k 1 for all k sum model fm if
we want to have someth in between for instanc increas the pressur to produc
good output we could choos the k ekt exponenti increas for some 0
exponenti model fme for we get the fmf for 0 the fm model if
we want to demand that the best of the output y1 yk is optim we must replac the
weight zsum by minz1 zt minimum model fmm we expect the behaviour
to be veri similar to the fmf model and do not consid it further
by construct the fm model guarante optim result in the usual sens that no
other model know onli can be expect to produc better result the varieti of
fm variant is not a fault of the theori they just reflect the fact that there is some
interpret freedom of what is meant by minim within t function call in
most applic probabl fmf is appropri in the npt applic one might prefer
the fm model
the interest case in ai is when is unknown we defin for thi case the fm model
by replac f with some f which should assign high probabl to function f of
low complex so we might define18 f qxu qxf x 2lq the problem with thi
definit is that it is in gener undecid whether a tm q is an implement of
a function f f defin in thi way is uncomput not even approxim as we

in it argument and f m yzyz 0 for z z it incorpor all gener knowledg
we have about function minim wherea 24 doe not but thi extra knowledg
ha onli low inform content complex of o1 so we do not expect fm to
perform much wors when use 24 instead of 60 but there is no reason to deviat
from 60 at thi point
we can now defin an error measur etfm as 59 with k 1 and minargy1 replac by
miny1 and addit replac by for etfm we expect etfm etfm to be bound
in a way that justifi the use of instead of for comput ie comput f0 in
the determinist case the argument are the same as for the ai model
is the gener model invent in the follow we will show that fm will never
ceas search for minima but will test an infinit set of differ y s for t
let us assum that the system test onli a finit number of yi a y a let t1
be the cycl in which the last new y a is select or some later cycl select y s in
cycl k t a second time the feedback z doe not provid ani new inform ie doe
not modifi the probabl f m the system can minim etfm by output in cycl

fix f for a moment then we have

as the true fm strategi is the one which minim e assumpt a is rule out if

output the best found y further for t the condit alway get satisfi as thi
is true for ani finit a the assumpt of a finit a is wrong for t the system test
an increas number of differ y s provid y is infinit the fmf model will never

the abov doe not necessarili hold for differ choic of k the abov also hold for
the fmf system if f 0 f 0 if the system can alreadi exclud that yt is a
better guess so there is no reason to test it explicitli
noth ha been said about the qualiti of the guess but for the fm system they are
optim by definit if k for the true distribut is finit we expect the fm
system to solv the explor versu exploit problem in a univers optim
way as converg to
use the ai model for function mininim the ai model can be use
for function minim in the follow way the output yk of cycl k is a guess for
a minimum of f like in the fm model the credit ck should be high for small function
valu zk f yk the credit should also be weight with k to reflect the same strategi
as in the fm case the choic of ck k zk is natur here the feedback is not binari
but ck c ir with c be a countabl subset of ir eg the comput real or
all ration number the feedback xk should be the function valu f yk so we set
xk zk note that there is a redund if is a comput function with no zero

one might expect no problem when go from the alreadi veri gener fm model to
the univers ai model with mk t but there is a pitfal in the case of the fmf

there is a feedback zk in everi cycl the ai system cannot learn from thi feedback as
it is not told that in the final cycl ct will equal to zt there is no problem in the fm

first learn that it ha to minim a function but it can onli learn if there is a nontrivi
credit assign ck fmf work for repeat minim of differ function such
as minim n function in n t cycl in thi case there are n nontrivi feedback
and ai ha time to learn that there is a relat between ckt and xkt everi tth cycl
thi situat is similar to the case of strateg game discuss in section 6
there is no problem in appli ai to fm becaus the c feedback provid enough
inform in thi case the onli thing the ai model ha to learn is to ignor the x
feedback as all inform is alreadi contain in c interestingli the same argument
hold for the fme model if k and kt are small20 the ai model ha addit
onli to learn the relat ck ekt xk thi task is simpl as everi cycl provid
one data point for a simpl function to learn thi argument is no longer valid for

remark tsp seem to be trivial in the ai model but nontrivi in the ai model
the reason be that 59 just implement an intern complet search as f f f t sp

as long as we give no effici approxim c of we have not contribut anyth

all we have done is to replac a np complet problem with the uncomput ai model
or by a comput ai c model for which we have said noth about comput time
yet it is simpli an overkil to reduc simpl problem to ai tsp is a simpl problem in
thi respect until we consid the ai c model serious for the other exampl where f

when teach a child by point to object and say thi is a tree or look how
green or how beauti one establish a relat of object properti pair in r
point to a possibl differ tree later and ask what is thi correspond to a
partial given pair object where the miss part should be complet by the
child say tree
a final exampl we want to give is chess we have seen that in principl chess can be
learn by reinforc learn in the extrem case the environ onli provid
credit c 1 when the system win the learn rate is complet inaccept from

a more practic method of teach chess is to present exampl game in the form of

teacher could ask the system to make it own move by present boardstat and
then evalu the answer of the system

the inform content in the c s must be of the order kr in practic there are

introduct until now we have not bother with the noncomput of the
univers probabl distribut as all univers model in thi paper are base on
they are not effect in thi form in thi section we will outlin how the previou
model and result can be modifiedgener to the timebound case inde the
situat is not as bad as it could be and c are enumer and y k is still approxim
or comput in the limit there exist an algorithm that will produc a sequenc of
output eventu converg to the exact output y k but we can never be sure whether
we have alreadi reach it besid thi the converg is extrem slow so thi
type of asymptot comput is of no direct practic use but will nevertheless be
import later
let p be a program which calcul within a reason time t per cycl a reason
intellig output ie px k y 1k thi sort of comput assumpt that a gener
purpos comput of suffici power is abl to behav in an intellig way is the veri
basi of ai justifi the hope to be abl to construct system which eventu reach
and outperform human intellig for a contrari viewpoint see 28 it is not necessari
to discuss here what is meant by reason timeintellig and suffici power
what we are interest in in thi section is whether there is a comput version ai t
of the ai system which is superior or equal to ani p with comput time per cycl
of at most t with superior we mean more intellig so what we need is an order
relat like 39 for intellig
the best result we could think of would be an ai t with comput time t at least
as intellig as ani p with comput time t if ai is possibl at all we would have
reach the final goal the construct of the most intellig algorithm with comput
t just as there is no univers measur in the set of comput measur within time
t such an ai t may neither exist
what we can realist hope to construct is an ai t system of comput time ct per
cycl for some constant c the idea is to run all program p of length l l
p and time

thi sort of idea of type monkey with one of them eventu write shakespear

realiz of thi best vote idea in our case is not straightforward and will be outlin
in thi section an idea relat to thi is that of base the decis on the major of

a classifi problem the probabl distribut cf accord to which exampl are
present is in mani case also elementari but not all ai problem are of thi easi
type for the strateg game of section 6 the environ is usual itself a highli
complex strateg player with a difficult to calcul sg that is difficult to calcul
although one might argu that the environment player may have limit capabl
too but it is easi to think of a difficult to calcul physic probabilist environ
like the chemistri of biomolecul
the number of interest applic make thi restrict class of ai problem with
time and space bound environ tl worth be studi superscript to a prob

thi result ha the propos structur that there is a univers ai tl system with com
putat time 2l time the comput time of a special aitl system
unfortun the class of aitl system with brute forc evalu of yk accord to
9 is complet uninterest from a practic point of view eg in the context of
chess the abov result say that the ai tl is superior within time 2l t to ani brute forc
minimax strategi of comput time t even if the factor of 2l in comput time
would not matter the ai tl system is nevertheless practic useless as a brute forc
minimax chess player with reason time t is a veri poor player
note that in the case of sequenc predict hk 1 y x 2 the comput time
of coincid with that of y kai within a factor of 2 the class aitl includ all nonincrement sequenc predict algorithm of size l and comput time t2 with
nonincrement we mean that no inform of previou cycl is taken into account
for the comput of yk of the current cycl
the shortcom mention and unment one of thi approach are cure in the
next subsect by deviat from the standard way of defin a timebound as a
sum over function or program
the idea of the best vote algorithm a gener cybernet or ai system is a chronolog program pxk y1k thi form introduc in section 2 is gener enough to
includ ani ai system and also less intellig system in the follow we are interest in program p of length l and comput time t per cycl one import
point in the timelimit set is that p should be increment ie when comput
yk in cycl k the inform of the previou cycl store on the work tape can be
reus inde there is probabl no practic interest nonincrement ai system
at all
in the follow we construct a polici p or more precis polici pk for everi cycl
k that outperform all time and length limit ai system p in cycl k pk run all 2l
program p and select the one with the best output yk thi is a best vote type of
algorithm as compar to the weight major like algorithm of the last subsect
the ideal measur for the qualiti of the output would be the expect credit

the program p which maxim ckmk should be select we have drop the normal n unlik in 38 as it is independ of p and doe not chang the order

is enumer which will be import later
10 time bound and effect
52
extend chronolog program in the function form of the ai model it wa
conveni to maxim ckmk over all p pk ie all p consist with the current histori
y
xk thi wa no restrict becaus for everi possibl inconsist program p there
exist a program p pk consist with the current histori and ident to p for all
futur cycl k for the time limit best vote algorithm p it would be too restrict
to demand p pk to prove univers one ha to compar all 2l algorithm in everi
cycl not just the consist one an inconsist algorithm may becom the best one
in later cycl for inconsist program we have to includ the y k into the input ie
p
py
xk y1k
with yi yip possibl for p p k thi wa not necessari as p know the
output y k ykp in thi case the cpq
i in the definit of ckm are the valuat emerg in
the io sequenc start with y
xk emerg from p and then continu by appli
p
p and q with y i yi for i k
anoth problem is that we need ckmk to select the best polici but unfortun ckmk
is uncomput inde the structur of the definit of ckmk is veri similar to that
of yk henc a brute forc approach to approxim ckmk requir too much comput
time as for y k we solv thi problem in a similar way by supplement each p with a
program that estim ckmk by wkp within time t we combin the calcul of ykp and
wkp and extend the notion of a chronolog program onc again to
py
xk w1p y1pwkp ykp
66
with chronolog order w1p y1p y 1 x 1 w2p y2p y 2 x 2
valid approxim p might suggest ani output ykp but it is not allow to rate it
with an arbitrarili high wkp if we want wkp to be a reliabl criterion for select the best
p we demand that no polici is allow to claim that it is better than it actual is we
defin a logic predic vap call valid approxim which is true if and onli if
p alway satisfi wkp ckmk p ie never overr itself
vap kw1p y1p y 1 x 1 wkp ykp py
xk w1p y1p wkp ykp wkp ckmk py

67
in the follow we restrict our attent to program p for which vap can be prove
in some formal axiomat system a veri import point is that ckmk is enumer
thi ensur the exist of sequenc of program p1 p2 p3 for which vapi can be
prove and limi wkpi ckmk p for all k and all io sequenc the approxim is
not uniform in k but thi doe not matter as the select p is allow to chang from
cycl to cycl
anoth possibl would be to consid onli those p which check wkp ckmk p onlin
in everi cycl instead of the precheck vap either by construct a proof on the
work tape for thi special case or it is alreadi evid by the construct of wkp in
case where p cannot guarante wkp ckmk p it set wk 0 and henc trivial satisfi
wkp ckmk p on the other hand for these p it is also no problem to prove vap as one
ha simpli to analyz the intern structur of p and recogn that p show the valid
intern itself cycl by cycl which is easi by assumpt on p the cycl by cycl
check is therefor a special case of the preproof of vap

the univers time bound ai tl system in the follow we describ the algo
rithm p underli the univers time bound ai tl system it is essenti base on
the select of the best algorithm pk out of the time t and length l bound p for which
there exist a proof of vap with length lp

take those string which are proof of vap for some p and keep the correspond

3 modifi all p in the follow way all output wkp ykp is temporarili written on an
auxiliari tape if p stop in t step the intern output is copi to the output

roughli speak the theorem say that if there exist a comput solut to some
ai problem at all the explicitli construct algorithm p is such a solut although
thi theorem is quit gener there are some limit and open question which we
discuss in the follow
limit and open question
formal the total comput time of p for cycl 1k increas linearli with
k ie is of order ok with a coeffici 2l t the unreason larg factor 2l is
a well known drawback in bestdemocrat vote model and will be taken without
further comment wherea the factor t can be assum to be of reason size if
we dont take the limit k but consid reason k the practic use of
the timebound on p is somewhat limit due to the addit addit constant
olp 2lp it is much larger than k2l t as typic lp lvap lp l
p is superior onli to those p which justifi their output by larg wkp it might be
possibl that there are p which produc good output ykp within reason time but
it take an unreason long time to justifi their output by suffici high wkp
we do not think that from a certain complex level onward there are polici
where the process of construct a good output is complet separ from some
sort of justif process but thi justif might not be translat at least
within reason time into a reason estim of ckmk p
the inconsist program p must be abl to continu strategi start by other
polici it might happen that a polici p steer the environ to a direct for
which it is special a foreign polici might be abl to displac p onli between
loos bound episod there is probabl no problem for factoriz think
of a chess game where it is usual veri difficult to continu the gamestrategi of
a differ player when the game is over it is usual advantag to replac
a player by a better one for the next game there might also be no problem for
suffici separ
there might be effici valid approxim p for which vap is true but not
provabl or for which onli a veri long lp proof exist
remark
the idea of suggest output and justifi them by prove credit bound implement one aspect of human think there are sever possibl reaction to an
input each reaction possibl ha far reach consequ within a limit time
one tri to estim the consequ as well as possibl final each reaction is
valu and the best one is select what is inferior to human think is that the
estim wkp must be rigor prove and the proof are construct by blind extens search further that all behaviour p of length l are check it is inferior
onli in the sens of necessari comput time but not in the sens of the qualiti
of the output

in practic applic there are often case with short and slow program ps
perform some task t eg the comput of the digit of for which there
also exist long and quick program pl too if it is not too difficult to prove that thi
long program is equival to the short one then it is possibl to prove kt lp

high lower bound without explicitli execut these short and slow program which
mainli contribut to ckmk
dovetail all length and timelimit program is a well known elementari idea
type monkey the crucial part which ha been develop here is the select
criterion for the most intellig system

close approxim of ckmk we expect that the behaviour of ai tl converg to the
behaviour of ai in the limit t l in a sens

in game theori 26 one often want to model the situat of simultan action
wherea the ai model ha serial io simultan can be simul by withhold the environ from the current system output yk until xk ha been receiv

due to the larg factor 2l in comput time but there are other applic
of the ai theori we have seen in sever exampl how to integr problem

of univers induct ha been downscal with mani insight to the minimum
descript length principl 22 30 or to the domain of finit automata 9 the ai

with a reason comput time the ai model would be a solut of ai see
next point if you disagre the ai tl model wa the first step but the elimin of
the factor 2l without give up univers will almost certainli be a veri difficult
task one could tri to select program p and prove vap in a more clever way than
by mere enumer to improv perform without destroy univers all
kind of idea like genet algorithm advanc theorem prover and mani more
could be incorpor but now we are in troubl we seem to have transfer
the ai problem just to a differ level thi shift ha some advantag and also
some disadvantag but present in no way a solut nevertheless we want
to stress that we have reduc the ai problem to mere comput question
even the most gener other system the author is awar of depend on some more
than comput assumpt about the environ or it is far from clear
whether they are inde univers and optim although comput question
are themselv highli complic thi reduct is a nontrivi result a formal
theori of someth even if not comput is often a great step toward solv a
problem and ha also merit of it own and ai should not be differ see previou
item
mani research in ai believ that intellig is someth complic and cannot
be condens into a few formula it is more a combin of enough method and
much explicit knowledg in the right way from a theoret point of view we
disagre as the ai model is simpl and seem to serv all need from a practic
point of view we agre to the follow extent to reduc the comput burden
one should provid special purpos algorithm method from the veri begin
probabl mani of them relat to reduc the complex of the input and output
space x and y by appropri preprocess method
there is no need to incorpor extra knowledg from the veri begin it can be
present in the first few cycl in ani format as long as the algorithm to interpret
the data is of size o1 the ai system will understand the data after a few cycl
see section 8 if the environ is complic but extra knowledg z make
kz small one can show that the bound 20 reduc to 21 ln 2 kz when
x1 z ie when z is present in the first cycl the special purpos algorithm
could be present in x1 too but it would be cheat to say that no special purpos
algorithm had been implement in ai the boundari between implement
and train is unsharp in the ai model
we have not said much about the train process itself as it is not specif to the
ai model and ha been discuss in literatur in variou form and disciplin
a seriou discuss would be out of place to repeat a truism it is of cours
import to present enough knowledg xk and evalu the system output yk with
ck in a reason way to maxim the inform content in the credit one
should start with simpl task and give posit reward ck 1 to approxim half
