abstract
we present a new method for construct solut to nonlinear evolutionari equat describ the propag and interact of nonlinear
wave
in the present paper with the help of some simpl exampl i demonstr
a new approach to the construct of asymptot solut to differenti equat i choos veri simpl exampl the hopf equat and it multidimension analog and on purpos omit detail in the proof of estim which
are obviou here
usual by say that a function is an asymptot approxim solut
of a differenti equat we mean that thi function satisfi the equat with
a small discrep the small of the discrep is understood as the
small in some uniform metric under the assumpt that a small paramet
tend to zero
a function is call a weak asymptot solut if after the substitut
of thi function into the equat there is a discrep that is small in the
weak sens as a small paramet tend to zero in thi case the function are
assum to depend on time as on a paramet
for exampl under thi approach the c approxim of a gener
function turn out to be it weak asymptot and we can choos gener
function to be the initi condit and use their approxim for construct the solut in thi case we obtain a small paramet which is either the
paramet of approxim or the small paramet in the origin equat in
the latter case thi origin small paramet is taken to be the paramet of
approxim
in fact thi approach is close to the idea propos by j f colombeau and
other author who construct differ algebra of gener function the
method itself wa first introduc in our paper with v m shelkovich initi
by the work of j f colombeau and m oberguggenberg with coautor and by
discuss with j a marti v v zharinov and s pilipovich the differ
with the tradit approach is that in our approach the mollifi is chosen not
thi work wa support by the russian foundat for basic research under grant
no 990101074
1
from the consider of the algebra construct but from the consider
of the origin differenti equat
in some case shock wave the solut is independ of the choic of
the mollifi while in other case soliton kink the solut depend on thi
choic
if the origin equat contain a small paramet then we in fact deal
with regular by small viscos or small dispers in thi case to
calcul a weak asymptot we need to calcul the zero viscos or zero
dispers limit henc we arriv at the problem of construct a definit
of a weak solut which admit thi passag to the limit
it turn out that the approach develop here can be use for describ
both the propag of nonlinear wave and which is the most import
their interact it is well known that the problem of interact of nonlinear
travel wave for instanc of two kink or two soliton in the case of a
singl spatial variabl can be formul as a problem of construct the exact
solut of a nonlinear equat with two spatial variabl correspond to the
coordin of the wave front if the initi problem can be integr by the
method of the invers scatter problem or in ani other way then one can
write out the solut of the abovement equat explicitli which allow
one to describ the interact analyt in our approach to describ the
interact one need to solv an ordinari differenti equat or a system
of such equat with a small paramet solut of such equat can
be construct by use a wellknown techniqu in what follow we consid
the main technic tool and some exampl which allow us to demonstr the
abil of our approach

that the relat lu od must be satisfi thi is the definit of the

then 0 t 20 10 is the distanc between the front of noninteract

we write 0 20 t 10 t at time t t such that 0 t 0 the weak

to construct formula that are uniform in t and describ the confluenc of
weak discontinu and the gener of a shock wave we seek the solut

where the function k1 satisfi the same condit as in item 2 a

follow from the equat 0t 2u10 0 0 after simpl calcul we see
that the function g g1 g2 satisfi the equat g 21 b2 0 and
the function is a solut of the boundari problem

we introduc the function g g obvious g

as wa alreadi shown the coeffici of the express in brace is a constant
the express in squar bracket is an approxim of the function at the
point 2 henc the entir express in brace is small in a uniform metric
as 0
we studi the problem in which a shock wave is gener by a special piecewis linear initi condit the case of a gener smooth initi function can
be treat similarli here we need to consid a famili of linear interpol of
thi initi condit and to use the abov techniqu on segment of the broken
line
to studi thi problem in more detail we note that we have consid onli
one possibl of evolut of the broken line name format of a step
anoth mechan of evolut is as follow segment of the broken line are
ad to the step that ha alreadi been form thi is the confluenc of a
weak discontinu and a shock wave
now we again consid the hopf equat in order to studi thi mechan
the initi condit correspond to thi type of interact ha the form

thu in thi exampl the mechan of format of a new shock wave consist
not in turn over the inclin segment of the broken line as in the preced

exampl but in the disappear of thi inclin segment due to increas
vertic segment
subtract the first equat from the third equat in 7 we obtain the
follow equat for the function

note that we can use the formula for 0 and for the function u00 and u10
onli for t 0 t where 0 is ani number such that t1 t
to obtain formula that are global in t we need to choos a number and
continu the function u00 u10 and 0 smoothli to the time t t so that
the sign is preserv calcul the coeffici of u0 2u1 one can easili
see that 0 for t t henc there exist a solut 0 where 0 is a
root of the equat

let us consid the system of equat for the function u0 and u1 by the

we repres the aboveconstruct solut in the form

u u a1 u t x
and in thi case the second term vanish sinc u0 u 0 and the third term
vanish sinc 1 2 0 recal that 0t u00 20 u10 for t t
in view of the equat we can continu the function 0t for t t in the
11
form 0t u in thi case the function u0 2u1 is continu uniformli in
for t t and we can show that the function is a solut of boundari valu
problem

the system of equat determin the weak asymptot solut in thi case
also split into separ equat
now we briefli consid the problem of decay of nonstabl shock wave
one can easili see that by set vt x t u x t t t t we obtain a
t depend famili of weak asymptot solut of the equat vt v 2 x 0
for t 0 the solut of thi famili are shock wave unstabl for thi new
equat the weak limit of these solut for 0 t t t is a shock wave
and for t t t is a broken line consist of two move weak discontinu
into which the unstabl shock wave split at time t t t t which is not
uniqu
c interact of shock wave in the multidimension case let us consid
the twodimension nonlinear equat aris in the reservoir problem

the abov approach can be easili gener to the case of an arbitrari
dimens if the codimens of the front of the nonlinear wave is 1 we
assum that a1 a2 are posit constant
we choos the initi condit as
u
t0
u0 u1 t 1 x u2 t 1 x
where x x1 x2 ui are posit constant and i x are the desir function
we write 0i x i x 0
clearli the curv 0i are given initi posit of the front of two shock
wave whose sum is just the initi condit in addit we assum that the
curv 0i are transvers to the vector field a a a1 a2 and 02 is
the crosssect of the trivial fibrat over 01 whose fiber are straight line
parallel to the vector a in addit we assum that the motion from the point
of 02 to the point of 01 is in the direct of the vector a in thi case the fact
that u1 u2 are posit constant is a suffici condit of stabil
if the function i x are known then the curv level surfac ti x t
i x 0 determin the front of shock wave at time t
act as befor see 2 a we substitut the approxim
u x t u0 u1 1 t 1 x u2 2 t 2 x
into the equat and calcul the weak asymptot of lu we obtain

2 1
12
here the function b1 and b2 are the same as in item 2 a formula for the
weak asymptot in the multidimension case are carri out in the same way
as in the onedimension case
roughli speak the twodimension integr becom an iter integr over the surfac ti and over the normal to thi surfac the asymptot
of the integr along the normal is calcul in the same way as in the onedimension case see 1
it follow from our assumpt that the inequ 0 hold for suffici small posit t henc we have and for small t we obtain
the follow equat describ the system of noninteract front
1 a 1 u1 2u0 0
1 a 2 u2 2u1 2u0 0

clearli these equat determin the limit function k0 if the curv 0i
on which they vanish are given
divid these equat by i and take into account the fact that in
view of our formula the wave travel in the direct of decreas function
k0 x we can rewrit the last system as
a n1 u1 2u0
vn1
1
a n2 u2 2u1 2u0
vn2

i
where ni is the normal at a point to ti vni is the normal veloc of thi
point clearli the veloc of the point of the curv t2 are larger than the
veloc of the point of the curv t2 along the trajectori of the field a
but the distanc between the curv ti along the trajectori depend in gener
on the point
therefor sinc the shape of these curv is rather arbitrari there may be
no complet confluenc of these curv at their contact a new shock wave
with summari amplitud u1 u2 is gener at the point of contact thi
shock wave travel with it new veloc and the solut may be of a rather
complic structur to describ thi wave uniformli in time we shall seek
the solut of the system

in the form
k x k0 x 0 xk1 0
10
where 0 20 x 10 x note that in view of our assumpt on the
geometri instead of the coordin x1 x2 we can introduc the coordin
s where s are the coordin on 02 and is a paramet on the trajectori
of the vector field a
henc we in fact calcul the distanc between the curv
i ie the
differ 0 along the trajectori of the field a
13
d
preserv instead of d
the notat a substitut 9 into 8 and
take into account 10 we obtain

here u0 u1 u2 2u0 0
the further is similar to that in the onedimension case it first stage is to
def
obtain an equat for the function 0 1 21 11
1 1 next we calcul the limit of the function bk as
after the interact and find equat for the limit function k as well as
equat for k1
subtract the first equat in 10 form the second one and carri out
sever calcul we obtain the desir equat for

one can show that the righthand side of thi equat that differ as one
can see from that in the similar equat in the onedimension case also ha
a singl root 0 and b2 0 12 and henc b1 0 12
henc it follow from eq 8 that for the same valu of s for which a point
of the curv
1 outrun the curv 1 we have
1 a k u1 u2 2u0 0
1
k 1 2

thi impli
and for a given s after the confluenc of the curv a
wave with summari amplitud u1 u2 travel in the direct of a thu for
a fix s the dynam of interact in the direct of a is similar to that in
the onedimension case
here we do not write out the equat for k1 they can be obtain in
the same way as the similar equat in the onedimension case
3
conclus
the problem of shock wave interact in the onedimension case is present
in 2 3 5 not onli for the hopf equat but also for equat with suffici
gener nonlinear the formula from sec 1 are deriv there in more detail
similarli in the multidimension case one can easili gener our construct to the case of more gener nonlinear variabl coeffici and
amplitud
for reason of space here we do not consid the problem of construct
definit of weak solut thi problem is discuss in 1 4 5 in particular
in 5 a definit of a weak solut is construct for kdv type equat
admit the zero dispers limit for soliton type solut
