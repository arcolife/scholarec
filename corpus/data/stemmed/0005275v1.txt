thi articl which is devot to new mathemat method for psychophys
filter of experiment data and their process may be regard as a develop of idea of ref1 on the experiment detect of interact in complex
system the main innov is that a psychophys filter is use consist
now for such detect
1 basic procedur let us consid a natur behavior social or econom
system s it will be describ by a set of quntiti which character it at
ani moment of time t so that t one may suppos that the evolut of the
system is describ by a differenti equat
and look for the explicit form of the function from the experiment data on the
system s howev the function may depend on time it mean that there are
some hidden paramet which control the system s and it evolut is of the
form
u
where u are such paramet of unknown natur one may suspect that such
paramet are chosen in a way to minim some goal function k which may be
an integrodifferenti function of t
k k t
such integrodifferenti depend will be briefli notat as k k below
more gener the paramet u may be divid on part u u1 un and each
part ui ha it own goal function ki howev thi hypothesi may be confirm
by the experi veri rare in the most case the choic of paramet u will
seem accident or even random nevertheless one may suspect that the control
ui are interact it mean that they are the coupl of the pure control ui with
the unknown or incomplet known feedback
ui ui ui
and each pure control ha it own goal function ki thu it is suspect that the
system s realiz an interact game there are sever way to defin the pure
control ui one of them wa propos in ref1 it is base on the integrodifferenti
filtrat of the control ui
ui fi ui
to verifi the formul hypothesi and to find the explicit form of the conveni
filtrat fi and goal function ki one should use the theori of interact game
which suppli us by the predict of the game and compar the predict with
the real histori of the game for ani consid fi and ki and choos such filtrat
and goal function which describ the realiti better one may suspect that the
depend of ui on is pure differenti for simplic or to introduc the socal intent field which allow to consid ani interact game as differenti
moreov one may suppos that
ui ui ui
and appli the elabor procedur of a posteriori analysi and predict to the
system
in mani case thi simpl algorithm effect unravel the hidden interact of a complex system howev sometim it doe not work therefor more
sophist procedur should be appli one of them will be describ below
let us consid an interact game with state and interact control w
w1 wm so that the evolut equat ha the form
w
the interact control are the coupl of pure control w w1 wm
with
the unknown or incomplet known feedback
w ww
often such interact game is a game of a real human person and the interact
is caus by the coupl of consciou and subconsci behavior reaction
let us consid the integrodifferenti nonlinear oper which will express
the pure control w via u and
w w u
in the simplest case one may put
w w u
the pure control w realiz a scenario for the interact game and it becom a
perform
the integrodifferenti filtrat should be appli to w instead of u now
ui fi w
we suspect that u u1 un are pure control for u u1 un it mean
that
u uu
and the explicit depend is unknown or incomplet known becaus we use
a human person the whole procedur realiz a psychophys filter of the
experiment data

2 psychophys engin
the basic procedur which is describ abov admit further improv
which are base on the idea of automata theori and form the psychophys
engin
first let us mark that an interact game may be regard as an infinit automata with continu time therefor one is abl to consid a composit
of interact game it mean that the interact control of one game are use
as pure control for other one certainli some integrodifferenti transform of
control analog to one decrib abov may be use between output of one
game and the input of anoth to glue the game such transform are defin by
the known integrodifferenti nonlinear oper of cours such oper are
reduc to function in the simplest case
such glue of interact game allow to construct veri sophist object
start from onli few basic interact game combin with the basic procedur
abov such psychophys engin becom an effect tool for the unravel
of interact in complex system concret part of the whole construct may
be realiz either by one human person or by their group of cours extern
interact phenomena of nonhuman natur may be use also
the simplest interact game which may be use for the psychophys engin are the visual or gener percept game howev it is difficult to
parallel such game so it is reason to interior the behavior reaction
which are gener in such game it mean that the function depend between pure and interact control are remeb and reproduc by the person
without ani extern or even intern visual imag
of cours the process of psychophys engin may be regard as a tactic procedur 2 and may contain the intuit subconsci step therefor
a psychophysiolog train may suffici enlarg the capabl of a person
to perform the psychophys engin the group train are effect when
group are use person abil to adapt the extern interact of nonhuman
natur are also veri essenti
