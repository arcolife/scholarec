abstract
some veri elementari idea about quantum group and quantum
algebra are introduc and a few exampl of their physic applic are mention
concept of quantum group and algebra emerg from two direct
studi on quantum integr model use the quantum invers scatter method 14 led to certain deform or quantiz of
classic matrix group and the correspond lie algebra the abstract mathemat concept underli these deform group structur were understood in the languag of hopf algebra 5 the quantum analogu or the qanalogu of classic lie algebra were also
obtain from a slightli differ approach 6
theori of quantum group wa recogn to be part of the program
of noncommut geometri 7 differenti calculu on noncommut space 813 led to the same quantiz algebra structur
encount in the theori of quantum invers scatter
to appear in the proceed of the the institut and instruct programm
on quantum group and their applic the ramanujan institut for advanc
studi in mathemat univers of madra chennai march 2001
the main reason for the great signific of these quantum algebra is that
they are relat to the so call quantum yangbaxt equat which play a
major role in quantum integr system solvabl lattic model conform
field theori knot theori etc also the represent theori of quantum
algebra led to a deform 1417 of the algebra of one of the most
fundament object of physic name the harmon oscil and thi
open up mani direct of research on qdeform physic system
let us consid a two dimension classic vector space whose element
can be written as
x
1
y
where the coordin x and y are real variabl and commut with each
other ie
xy yx
2
in the space of function f x y defin in the abov vector space the
partial deriv oper x
and y
and the oper of multipl
by x and y satisfi the differenti calculu

where the commut bracket is defin by

let us make a linear transform of the vector

x

as
x
y

where the entri of the matrix m are real and satisfi the condit
ad bc det m 1

or in other word the transform 5 is an element of the group sl2 r
then the new coordin x and y and partial deriv with respect to
2
them name x and
check by note
x

y
also satisfi the same relat as 3 thi is easili

where a mean the transpos of the matrix a we say that the differenti
calculu on the two dimension x yplane is covari under the group
sl2 r
in natur all physic system are quantum mechan but the quantum
mechan behaviour is gener reveal onli at the microscop molecular
and deeper level at the macroscop level of everyday experi quantum
physic becom classic physic as an approxim so onli classic
physic wa discov first and observ of failur of classic physic at
the atom level led to the discoveri of quantum physic in the 20th centuri
thi passag from classic physic to quantum physic can be mathemat describ as a process of deform of the classic physic wherein
the commut classic observ of a physic system are replac by
noncommut hermitian oper thi process is character by a veri
small deform paramet known as the planck constant h
and roughli
speak in the limit h
0 classic physic is recov from the structur
of quantum physic
in analog with the process of quantiz the classic physic let us
now quantiz the classic vector space to get a quantum vector space by
assum that the coordin do not commut with each other at ani point
let us model the noncommut of the coordin x and y of a two
dimension quantum plane by
xy qy x
8
where q is the deform paramet which we shall consid in gener
to be ani nonzero complex number note that in the limit q 1 the
noncommut quantum coordin x and y becom commut classic
coordin to be specif let us choos
q ei
9
it is easi to find an exampl of such noncommut variabl let t and
g be oper act on function of a singl real variabl x such that
t x x
g x eix x
3
10
then for ani x
t g x eix x ei g t x
11
for a given fix valu of thu with the variat of t and g
becom noncommut variabl obey the relat
t g ei g t
12
with fix valu for
now the interest question are
is it possibl to defin a differenti calculu on the two dimension
x y plane
if so will it be covari under some gener of the classic
group sl2
the answer are ye ye first let us understand how one can give a mean
to partial deriv with respect to x and y these have to oper on
the space of function f x y which we shall consid to be polynomi
in x and y we can write f x y mn fmn x m y n sinc ani polynomi
in x and y with coeffici commut with x and y can be brought to
thi form use the commut relat 8 then if we take formal
m
x mx m1
x
n
y ny n1
y
13
we would have a differenti calculu in the x y plane as desir onc we
prescrib consist the remain commut relat between x y
and y
x
without go into ani further detail let me state the complet set of
commut relat defin the differenti calculu in the x y plane
with q ei

in the theori of classic lie group we know that an element of a lie
group g say g can be written as
g e1 l1 e2 l2 en ln
29
where the paramet i character the group element g and li are
constant gener of the group g satisfi a lie algebra
n
cijk lk

i j 1 2 n
30
k1
with cijk as the structur constant when the group element g is close to
the ident element i of the group the paramet i are infinitesim
and one can write
n
gi

31

now the interest question is
is there an analogu of the lie algebra in the case of a quantum group
the answer is ye to thi end first we have to recal some basic notion of
the theori of qseri
one defin the qshift factori by
x qn

32
then with the notat

an r s basic hypergeometr seri or a gener qhypergeometr seri is
given by

the qnumber nq or the socal basic number wa defin by hein
1846 much of ramanujan work is relat to these qseri note that

ezq ez
nq n
37
thu ezq defin by 35 is a qgener of the exponenti function
call a qexponenti function note that there can be sever gener
of the exponenti function satisfi the condit that in the limit q 1 it
should becom the standard exponenti function in the theori of quantum
group a new definit of the qnumber is often use it is
nq
q n q n
q q 1
38
note that nq also becom n in the limit q 1 and nq is symmetr with
respect to the interchang of q and q 1 unlik hein nq
now consid the 2dimension t matrix parametr as
t

which requir the variabl paramet to satisfi a lie algebra
log q
log q

so that a b c d obey the algebra 17 then one can write

actual equat 41 is the special case of a univers formula for the

which provid the three dimension irreduc represent of the slq 2

as given by 39 note that in the limit q 1 these matric 46
obey the sl2 algebra 45 as seen from 39 43 and 44 one can say
that for a quantum group the groupparamet space is noncommut
the algebra slq 2 is also often call a quantum group actual the
relat in 44 defin the gener of the qdeform of the univers envelop algebra of sl2 henc the relat 44 are also refer
to more properli as uq sl2 the qdeform univers envelop algebra
of sl2 the algebra uq sl2 gener by polynomi in x0 x x
obey the relat 44 is also a hopf algebra we shall consid onli the
coproduct for uq sl2 a coproduct for slq 2 is
q x0 x0 1l 1l x0
q x x q x0 q x0 x
47
it can be easili verifi that thi comultipl rule is an algebra isomorph for slq 2
q x0 q x q x
q x q x 2q x0 q 48
the most import properti of thi coproduct is it noncommut
note that the algebra 44 is invari under the interchang q q 1 sinc
2x0 q 2x0 q1 howev the comultipl 47 is not invari under
such an interchang thi mean that the comultipl obtain from 47
by an interchang q q 1 should also be an equal good comultipl
it can be verifi that the coproduct so obtain name
q1 x0 x0 1l 1l x0
q1 x x q x0 q x0 x 49
is inde an algebra isomorph for slq 2 thi coproduct 49 q1 is
call the opposit coproduct in view of the relat
q1 x q x where u v v u
50
sinc
q1 q
or
51
the comultipl q and q1 of slq 2 are noncommut in the
limit q 1 the classic sl2 ha onli a singl comultipl x
x 1l 1l x which is commut ie
one can show that the two comultipl of sl2 q name q and
1
q are relat to each other by an equival relat such that there
11
exist an r uq sl2 uq sl2 call the univers rmatrix satisfi
the relat
52
q1 x rq x r1
thi univers rmatrix is the central object of the quantum group theori
in thi case it can be shown that
n
r q 2x0 x0

q x q x0 x

53
if we insert the matrix represent of x in thi express for r we get
numer rmatric for exampl substitut in 53 the 2 2 represent of x given in 42 we get the fundament 4dimension rmatrix

let us now write ani r in the form

it is clear from 53 that thi can be done now defin

then these satisfi the remark relat

known as the quantum yangbaxt equat or simpli the yangbaxt
equat ybe
we have consid onli the simplest exampl of a quantum group
name slq 2 associ with the classic group sl2 there exist a
systemat theori of deform of ani classic group it is also possibl
in certain case to obtain deform with sever qparamet actual
the studi of quantum group shed more light on the structur of the classic group theori i shall not go further into the detail of the formal of
quantum group theori
12
now i am in a posit to mention a few applic of quantum group
and algebra first let us see how these thing start defin

thi type of relat is commonli encount in the quantum invers scatter method approach to integr model in quantum field theori and statist mechan substitut in 60 r from 54 and t1 and t2 from 58
it is found that equat 60 is a compact way of state the commut
relat 17 defin the fundament t matrix of slq 2 what about the
commut relat 44 defin slq 2 defin

then the commut relat 44 defin the gener of slq 2 can
be state elegantli as
r1 l1 l2
l2 l1 r1
r1 l1 l2
l2 l1 r1
62
note that the l matric are special realiz of the t matric ie
the element of l matric obey the commut relat requir of the

13
if we defin for the rmatrix in 54

which is an altern form of the ybe 57 for ani gener rmatrix
the ybe 57 can be put in thi form 65 thi relat 65 repres a
properti of the gener of a braid group which is a gener of the
well known symmetr group sn the symmetr group sn is the group of
all permut of n given object an element of the braid group bn can
be depict as a system of n string join two set of n point each set
locat on a line the two line say top and bottom be parallel with
overcross or undercross of the string the overcross and the
undercross of the string make bn an infinit group which will otherwis
reduc to sn if i and i 1 are two consecut point on the top and bottom
line the string start at i on the top line can reach i 1 on the bottom
line by either undercross or overcross the string start at i 1 on
the top line and reach i on the bottom line the correspond element
of the braid group are usual denot by i and i1 respect the
element i i 1 2 n 1 gener the braid group bn satisfi two
relat
i j j i for i j 1
66
and
i i1 i i1 i i1
67
now compar the relat 65 and 67 it is obviou that the solut
of the ybe rmatric or the quantum algebra should play a central
role in the theori of represent of braid group braid group have
mani applic in mathemat they are use in the studi of complex
function of hypergeometr type have sever variabl in physic they
appear in knot theori statist mechan twodimension conform field
theori and so on
14
in quantum mechan the notion of continu spacetim with commut coordin is taken over from classic mechan thi is an assumpt what will happen if at some deeper microscop level the spacetim
coordin themselv are noncommut it is clear that to deal with
such a situat one will have to use a noncommut differenti calculu
and the theori of quantum group provid the necessari framework as we
have seen abov for exampl consid the motion of a quantum particl in a
two dimension noncommut plane with x and y as the coordin if
we take the correspond conjug momenta to be proport to x
and
respect
then
the
relat
14
indic
how
the
twodimension

quantum mechan phasespac would be deform at that level thu
the theori of quantum group would provid the mathemat framework
for the futur of quantum physic if it turn out that at some deeper microscop level spacetim manifold is noncommut henc there ha been
a lot of interest in studi the fundament modif that would occur
in the framework quantum mechan rel theori poincar group
etc if the spacetim manifold happen to be noncommut
apart from applic of fundament natur such as those mention
abov there have been mani phenomenolog applic of quantum algebra in nuclear physic condens matter physic molecular physic quantum optic and elementari particl physic in these applic either an
exist model is identifi with a quantum algebra structur or a standard model is deform to have an underli quantum algebra structur
and studi to reveal the new featur emerg to give an idea of such
applic let me mention as the final exampl the qdeform of the
quantum mechan harmon oscil algebra also known as the boson
algebra the algebra treatment of the quantum mechan harmon oscil involv a creation oper a an annihil oper a and
a number oper n obey the commut relat
n a a
a a 1
68
where n is a hermitian oper and a is the hermitian conjug of a the
energi spectrum of the harmon oscil is given by the eigenvalu of the
hamiltonian oper

in the appropri unit take two such set of oscil oper

72
thi lie algebra 72 is seen to be the same as the sl2 algebra 45 subject
to the hermit condit 71 and is known as su2 algebra the lie
algebra of the group su2 the su2 algebra is the algebra of three dimension rotat or the rigid rotat with j0 j repres the angular
momentum oper the coproduct rule
j0 j0 1l 1l j0
j j 1l 1l j
73
for the algebra 72 obtain by set q 1 in 47 or 49 repres
the rule for addit of angular momenta correspondingli the relat 44
rewritten as
j0 j j j j 2j0 q
74
with the hermit condit
j0 j0
j j
75
repres the suq 2 or uq su2 algebra or the qdeform version of the
su2 algebra 72 one can say that suq 2 is the algebra of the qrotat
for the qangular momentum oper there are two possibl addit rule
q1 j0 j0 1l 1l j0
q1 j j q j0 q j0 j 76
as seen from 47 and 49 now the interest fact is that one ha a realiz of suq 2 gener given by

each set the algebra

78
further n is hermitian and a a is a hermitian conjug pair the
qdeform oscil algebra 78 is known as the qoscil or the qboson
algebra when q 1 the qoscil algebra 78 reduc to the canon
oscil algebra 68 as is easi to guess phenomenolog applic of
quantum algebra in nuclear and molecular spectroscopi involv the substitut of harmon oscil model by the qoscil model and the rigid
rotat model by the qrotat model such applic lead to impress
result show that the actual vibrationalrot spectra of nuclei and
molecul can be fit into scheme in which the number of phenomenolog
qparamet requir are veri much fewer than the number of tradit
phenomenolog paramet requir to fit the same spectral data somehow such qdeform model seem to take into account more effici the
anharmon of vibrat and the nonrigid of rotat in nuclear and
molecular system
befor close i should also mention that besid f unq sl2 and it
dual quantum algebra uq sl2 there exist one more and onli one more

sinc it is imposs even to mention all the mathemat and physic
aspect of quantum group and algebra within a short articl such as thi
i shall list a collect of book review and paper 2272 which should
be consult for more detail and further refer to the origin work
obvious my list of refer is neither exhaust nor up to date for
recent literatur one should refer to the eprint archiv mathqa
final the follow may also be note in the algebra 79 the basic
commut are seen to be not linear combin of the gener as
should be for a lie algebra but quadrat function of the gener such
deform of lie algebra without ani further structur like coproduct
map are in gener known in physic literatur as polynomi deform
of lie algebra such algebra had been discov in the studi of physic
system even earlier 7374 and are also of current interest see eg 75
and refer therein
i am thank to prof s parvathi for give me the opportun to
particip in thi institut and instruct programm on quantum
group and their applic at the ramanujan institut for advanc
studi in mathemat univers of madra
