monopol are solut of a first order partial differenti equat the bogomolni equat they can be thought of as approxim by static magnet
particl in r3 in these note we will consid what monopol are and some of
the variou approach to understand them in particular we will discuss the
spectral curv twistor theori nahm transform and ration map of a monopol a
good start refer for all thi materi is the book by atiyah and hitchin 2 on
monopol scatter in particular chapter 16 background materi from which
these note have borrow notat see also the excel survey by sutcliff 22

we start with a lie algebra which we will assum is su2 the lie algebra of all
skewhermitian 2 by 2 matric let a be a oneform with valu in su2 so that

a i1 ai dxi and each ai is a function ai r3 su2 the higg field is a
function r3 su2 the oneform a can be thought of as the connect oneform for a connect d a on a trivial su 2 bundl on r3 the curvatur
of such a connect is the twoform

from thi we easili deduc that the minima of the yangmillshigg function
are solut of the bogomolni equat 1 or the antibogomolni equat
fa a as chang to chang a solut of the bogomolni equat
to a solut of the antibogomolni equat we concentr our attent on the
former
the bogomolni equat are invari under gaug transform that is replac a by
gag 1 gdg 1 gg 1
where g r3 su 2 the energi densiti 2 is also invari under gaug transform when we talk about a monopol we are realli talk about an equival class of a under gaug transform
the boundari condit impos on a monopol are primarili that the energi
densiti 2 should have finit integr that is the action 3 is finit there
are some addit technic condit that we will not be concern with it is
believ in ani case that these can all be deduc from finit of the action and
the bogomolni equat from these boundari condit we can deduc that
after a suitabl gaug transform we can arrang for the higg field to have a
limit valu at infin
u lim tu

where u s the boundari condit can be use to show that the eigenvalu
of the higg field at infin are independ of the direct u s 2 in the case of
su 2 thi is equival to the fact that u2 constant for all u
it is easi to show that if c 0 and a solv the bogomolni equat then

between two monopol due the higg field and the connect cancel thi
lead to the conjectur that stabl higher charg monopol would exist weinberg
in 1979 23 calcul that the dimens of the moduli space of monopol would
be 4k if it wa nonempti final in 1981 taub 12 show that the moduli
space wa nonempti
it is use to briefli discuss taub proof as it reveal some of the interest
structur of the moduli space taub start with k point a long way apart in
r3 surround by veri larg ball at the centr of each of these ball he place a
bp monopol and join these all togeth smoothli the result is not of cours
a solut to the bogomolni equat but it is close to one such an approxim
solut can be use as the initi stage of an iter scheme which converg to
a real solut
the solut produc by taub are on the edg of the moduli space that
is the moduli space mk ha a compact region outsid of which the monopol
approxim a superposit bp monopol at k point in particular the energi
densiti will be concentr at these k point one might also expect that the
higg field ha a zero at each of these k point but thi ha not been prove note
that think of the charg k monopol as k bp monopol give an explan
of the dimens of the moduli space each constitu bp monopol contribut
it posit three paramet and a phase which is a point on the circl make
a total of four paramet
it is import to note that when the charg is greater than one we cannot
associ to everi monopol a a collect of k point which are the locat
of the k particl we think of as it constitu we can howev associ sensibl
to a k monopol a centr of mass or locat 8 which we defin below

the analysi of monopol directli in term of the connect and higg field
on r3 for exampl the definit of the locat of a monopol while possibl
is difficult part of thi difficulti stem from the infinit dimension symmetri
group of gaug transform research on monopol ha focus on variou
transform which are design to construct some other mathemat data
equival to the monopol studi of these data then hope shed light on
the origin monopol thi process is particularli use if the object produc
is an invari of the monopol someth which doe not chang under gaug
transform the transform we will discuss below are
the spectral curv which is an invari of the monopol
hitchin adapt of the twistor transform which relat monopol to holomorph bundl on minitwistor space
the nahm transform which relat monopol to solut of an ordinari
differenti equat on the interv 1 1 and
the ration map which is anoth invari of the monopol

let t be an orient line in r3 thi can be put in the form

with vector u and v determin uniqu by the requir that u 1 u v 0
and u point in the direct of the orient along the line we have hitchin

asymptot analysi of ordinari differenti equat show that for ani line there
are solut s1 t and s2 t of the hitchin equat 5 which behav asymptot

similarli there are solut that decay and blow up exponenti as t for
the modifi hitchin equat a solut that blow up decay at one end of the
line decay blow up at the other end in gener thi will not be true of solut
of the hitchin equat in particular asymptot analysi tell us that there will
be a ball in r3 of radiu r 0 with the properti that if a line lie outsid the ball
then the solut s1 t and s2 t behav like the solut to the modifi hitchin
equat that is s1 t decay as t and s2 t blow up as t
we expect then that line which do not exhibit thi behaviour are somehow close
to the monopol we call a line a spectral line if there is a solut to the hitchin
equat which decay at both end we call the set of all spectral line the spectral
curv of the monopol it is easi to see that be a spectral line for a monopol
is independ of gaug transform so the spectral curv is an invari of the
monopol
it is not difficult to show that for the bp monopol locat at the point x r3
the spectral line are exactli the line pass through x note that thi is a twodimension set inde a copi of s 2 thi is more gener true the spectral
curv is alway a twodimension famili of line to say more about the structur
of the spectral curv we need to consid the set of all orient line in r3
the import of the spectral curv is the follow theorem of hitchin
theorem 31 hitchin 6 if monopol a and a have spectral curv
s and s and s s then a is an unfram gaug transform of a
note that s s mean equal of the correspond set of orient line in r3
and that an unfram gaug transform is one without the requir that
limt g0 0 t 1 cf equat 4 theorem 31 tell us that the spectral
curv determin the monopol up to the action of the circl on the moduli space
it is possibl to also add a small amount of addit data to the spectral curv
which captur thi phase we shall not concern ourselv with that here
4 the twistor theori of monopol
as we have discuss abov each orient line in r3 is determin uniqu by
vector u and v satisfi u 1 u v 0 it follow that the set of all orient
line is the tangent bundl to the twospher
t s 2 u v u 1 u v 0
thi is often call the minitwistor space of r3 minitwistor space is natur
a complex manifold and we can introduc coordin on the open subset
where u 0 0 1 by let

the relationship between minitwistor space and r3 is summaris by the equat
10
x1 ix2 2x3 x1 ix2 2
if we hold fix then the x1 x2 x3 satisfi 10 defin a line in r3 on
the other hand if we hold x1 x2 x3 fix then the satisfi 10 parametris
the set of all line through the point x x1 x2 x3 which is a copi of s 2 insid
t s 2
minitwistor space ha an involut t s 2 t s 2 which send each orient
line to the same line with opposit orient in coordin thi is given by
1
2
becaus is like a conjug it is call the real structur the set of all line
through the point x is real in the sens that it is fix by the real structur
we can now state the basic result concern the spectral curv it is a subset
of t s 2 defin by an equat of the form
11
p k a1 k1 ak 0
where each of the ai is a polynomi of degre 2i
note that by no mean everi such curv is the spectral curv of a monopol
one constraint is immedi from our definit if a line is a spectral line then
so also is the line with the opposit orient so the spectral curv is real that
is fix by the real structur but more is true the famili of real curv defin
by equat of the form 11 is k 12 1 real dimension wherea the moduli
space of monopol is 4k dimension so there have to be further constraint on
the spectral curv in particular a certain holomorph line bundl must be trivial
when restrict to the spectral curv it is possibl to say quit precis what the
other constraint are and henc to say in principl which spectral curv give rise
to monopol 7
spectral curv can be use to deduc a number of use fact about monopol
it is easi to show that the onli real curv of the type 11 for k 1 are those of
the form 10 for some point x1 x2 x3 henc the bp monopol are the onli
charg one monopol
the coeffici a1 in 11 defin a real curv and henc ha the form
a1 x1 ix2 2x3 x1 ix2 2
for some point x1 x2 x3 in r3 thi point is call the centr of the monopol
if u v1 u vk is a collect of k parallel line let us defin their averag to
k
be the line u 1k i1 vi notic from definit of 9 that if these line have
complex coordin 1 k then their averag ha complex coordin
k
1k i1 i if we fix a particular direct in r3 that is fix a and look for
all the spectral line in that direct we are find all the satisfi a degre
k polynomi and henc there are gener k of them if we take the averag of
all these line then it will pass through the monopol centr thi give us a way
of defin the centr entir in r3 take the averag of the spectral line in each
direct in r3 the result famili of line will nearli all intersect in a singl
point that point is the centr of the monopol
the definit of the spectral curv of a monopol clearli preserv the action of
the rotat and translat of r3 and thi give us a way of look for monopol
8
michael k murray
with particular symmetri we look first for spectral curv with these symmetri
thi approach can be use to show that the onli spheric symmetr monopol
is the bp monopol at the origin it wa use by hitchin 7 to classifi the axial symmetr monopol and more recent 8 to find monopol with symmetri
group those of the regular solid
the variou properti of the spectral curv such as the form of equat 11
are prove by use hitchin twistor transform hitchin 6 introduc the vector
space e of all solut to hi equat 5 thi is a twodimension space
and the collect of them all defin a complex vector bundl e over the minitwistor space t s 2 hitchin show that the bogomolni equat impli that e is
a holomorph vector bundl and moreov the monopol can be recov from
know e the boundari condit of the monopol then enter by note that
there are two distinguish holomorph subbundl e and e of solut to
hitchin equat which decay at and infin the spectral curv is the set
where these line bundl coincid algebra geometri can then be use to prove
theorem 31 and that the spectral curv satisfi an equat of the form 11
variou constraint on the spectral curv also follow from the twistor theori the
precis constraint that a curv must satisfi to be the spectral curv are given in 7
the proof that a spectral curv satisfi these constraint come from a monopol
requir the nahm transform which we consid next
5 the nahm transform and nahm equat
an altern point of view on monopol come via nahm adapt of the
atiyah drinfeld hitchin manin construct of instanton 20 nahm consid
a dirac oper on r3 coupl to the monopol in more detail let i be an orthonorm basi for the lie algebra su2 thi particular su2 should be regard
as differ to the monopol su2 in which the connect and higg field take valu it is in fact the lie algebra of the spin group of the group of rotat of r3
the dirac oper dz is defin by
3
dz
i1

i i iz

and act on c c valu function on r3 the first c2 is the spin space on which
the i act and the second is the space on which the ai and act here z is ani
real number we also defin an adjoint
3
dz
i1
i i iz
if we comput the composit the bogomolni equat show us that
3
dz dz
i1
i i iz iz
which is a posit oper and henc ha no l2 kernel from thi we conclud
that dz ha no l2 kernel an l2 index theorem of callia show that dz ha index
k if 1 z 1 and 0 otherwis henc it follow that dz ha a k dimension l2
kernel nz if 1 z 1 the point of view we wish to adopt is that nz is a k
dimension vector bundl over the interv 1 1
monopol

we are interest in section of thi vector bundl that is function
1 1 r3 c2 c2
which satisfi dz z x 0 for everi z 1 1 choos k of these 1 k so
that for each z they span nz moreov choos them so that they are orthonorm

and satisfi

d3 x 0
for all i j 1 k here of cours ij is the kroneck delta which is zero unless
i j when it is one notic that there is no obstruct to satisfi these extra
condit we can use grammschmidt orthogonalis for the first and the
second is just solv an ordinari differenti equat on 1 1
now we defin three k by k matrix function of z by
taij z
i xa j d3 x
r3
for i j 1 k and a 1 2 3 the remark thing about thi nahm transform is that these matrix valu function satisfi some simpl ordinari differenti equat call nahm equat

it is possibl to cast nahm equat into lax form and solv them by the

we have
proposit 51 the curv sz is independ of z
proof choos an eigenvector v of a with eigenvalu at some z z0 now
evolv v with the differenti equat

michael k murray
and consid
dav
a av aa v aa v

a av
it follow that
d
av v 0
dz
and becaus av v vanish at z0 it must vanish everywher we conclud that
the eigenvalu of a are independ of z and henc that sz is independ of
z
if we identifi the in 12 with the coordin 9 on minitwistor space
we realis sz as a curv in minitwistor space thi is in fact a natur thing to
do it is a remark fact 9 that the curv s sz defin via nahm transform
is the same as the spectral curv of the monopol defin in section 3
standard method from integr system can be use to solv nahm equat use the curv s and some addit structur inde in 7 hitchin use
thi approach to determin exactli which spectral curv correspond to monopol
one of the import properti of nahm equat is that it is straightforward
to defin a monopol from a solut of nahm equat plu some boundari
condit given such a solut and a point x1 x2 x3 in r3 we defin

6 ration map
although spectral curv are a use invari of monopol it is veri difficult
given a spectral curv for exampl a polynomi as in 11 to determin if it is the
spectral curv of a monopol anoth approach to monopol is the ration map
of a monopol by a ration map we mean a meromorph function rz c c
of the form
pz
rz
qz
where p and q are polynomi with no common divisor we will be interest first
in base ration map that is those which send to 0 and have degre k for a
degre k base ration map we requir that q is monic of degre k and that p ha
degre strictli less than k let rbk be the set of all such map then we have
theorem 61 donaldson 4 if we choos an orthogon split of r3 as cr
then there is a diffeomorph
mk rbk
we shall indic in a moment how to construct a ration map from a monopol
it is import to note that the invers construct from ration map to monopol
is not known all that is known is that there is a map mk rbk which can be shown
to be a diffeomorph thi is to be contrast with the case of spectral curv
where although we have not discuss it an invers construct is known and
with nahm construct where the invers construct is quit straightforward
it seem that what we gain by know that everi ration map is the ration map
of some monopol we lose by not know how to get back to a monopol given a
ration map
to defin the ration map we choos first the orthogon split thi amount
to choos a direct in r3 and an orthogon plane now consid hitchin
equat along each line parallel to that direct becaus of the frame we have
1
lim 0 0 t
t
2
i 0
0 i
we choos a gaug so that
1
lim x y t
2
t
i
0
0
i
for everi x y for each z x iy consid the onedimension subspac of c2 of
solut decay along the line x y t as t up to scale thi line is span
by a vector az bz it turn out that bz is a polynomi of degre k with
root 1 k we choos the uniqu polynomi pzof degre k 1 such that
p i a i for all i 1 k final we defin rz pzbz notic that
as x2 y2 the solut which decay as t blow up as t and
henc az 0 so that map rz is base note also that the spectral line of the
form x y t have bx iy 0 so that they correspond to the pole of the ration
map
while an extrem use invari of the monopol as everi base ration
correspond to exactli one monopol there are two signific problem one we
have alreadi note the invers map from ration map to monopol is not known
anoth is that the construct break symmetri by write r3 as cr and henc
12
michael k murray
the construct doe not preserv the full group of rotat of r3 but instead the
group of rotat around the axi which determin the split c r
there is an altern approach to ration map due to jarvi 13 14 which
avoid the problem of symmetri break the ration map is also simpler to
defin for thi we pick a point in r3 and consid hitchin equat along each
orient line through that point parametris the line through the point by
and the distanc along the line by t then the solut that decay in the forward
direct is given by
s0 t
s t 1
s t
the jarvi ration map is then defin by
s0 0
s1 0
to obtain a gaug invari correspond we note that the ration map is onli
determin up to the action of su 2 by fraction linear transform then
jarvi prove
r
theorem 62 jarvi 13 14 if we choos a point in r3 there is a diffeomorph
mk s 1 rk su 2
here rk is the set of all ration map of degre k not just base and the space
mk s 1 is the unfram moduli space that is the moduli space divid by the
action of the circl act by constant gaug transform
the precis relationship between the jarvi ration map and the donaldson
ration map ha not yet been determin but it is believ that by move the
point determin the jarvi map out to infin along a line and suitabl rescal
the map that the donaldson map will be recov
7 conclus
we conclud by consid three signific omiss and generalis
firstli the moduli space ha a natur hyperkaehl metric the physic interpret of thi is as follow consid the configur space c of all pair a
satisfi the boundari condit of a monopol insid c we have the space c0
of solut of the bogomolni equat and the monopol moduli space is the
quotient of c0 by the group of all gaug transform a solut of the full
yangmillshigg equat describ a curv at t in c where the t paramet is time monopol point on c0 are static solut of the full yangmillshigg
equat and the minima of a potenti energi function on c if we start with
a point a on c0 and give it a small push then by conserv of energi it
should describ a path stay close to c0 and solv the full yangmillshigg
equat in the limit as the size of the push becom zero these path determin
geodes of the natur hyperkaehl metric
it follow that the geodes on the monopol moduli space of thi metric should
approxim the motion of slowli move monopol if we start with a monopol
near the edg of the moduli space which can be interpret as a collect of k
particl and follow it along a geodes until it emerg again into the region where
it can be regard as k particl we will have describ a scatter process which
should be an approxim to true kmonopol scatter thi idea is due to
monopol
13
manton 16 and in 2 atiyah and hitchin describ the metric on the moduli space
of charg two monopol and certain of it geodes and interpret the result in
term of two particl monopol scatter
secondli it is possibl to generalis all the present discuss to other compact
simpl lie group although the nahm correspond onli work simpli for the
classic lie group see for exampl 17 10 11 it is also possibl to generalis
to the loop group and loop group monopol or caloron can be interpret as
instanton on s 1 r3 5
thirdli the underli space r3 can be replac by hyperbol three space and
mani of the result here carri over thi idea is due to atiyah 1 and further
develop in 3 18 and 19
