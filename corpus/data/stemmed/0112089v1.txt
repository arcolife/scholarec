we investig the method to combin the techniqu of quantum chemisti
with qed in our theori we treat the nelectron system and the dirac sea on
an equal foot we regard both of them as the dynam degre of freedom
of a manybodi system after the introduct of our qedscf method the
qedscf solut are classifi into sever class on the basi of grouptheoret oper such as time revers pariti and o3 rotat symmetri the natur orbit of gener qedscf solut are determin
by diagon the first order densiti matrix thu we obtain the possibl to treat the system under strong qed effect by the method of quantum
chemistri such as qedmcscf and qedcoupledclust approach

veri recent we have develop the program packag for ab initio hf and densiti function
dft calcul of molecul by use the gso 45 it wa shown that gso hf
and gso dft approach are use for qualit understand of correl and spin
correl effect in polyrad with orbit degeneraci 45
by the way it is a wellknown fact that in atom and molecul physic the relativist
effect becom crucial in mani case especi in the electron structur calcul for
heavi element we have to introduc a kind of relativist treatment for exampl the case
of neutral heavi element can be treat satisfactorili by the diraccoulombbreit nosea
scheme 6 thi method is base on the nosea the approxim complet neglect
the effect of the dirac sea hamiltonian it ha a diractyp onebodi hamiltonian and
the interact of electron is treat via the coulomb potenti and breit oper 7
thi hamiltonian with sever manybodi scheme hf relativist manybodi perturb
theori rmbpt so on give good numer result for neutral heavi element in atom
and molecul but especi in the case of highli charg heavi element the accur
secondord rmbpt indic that quantum electrodynam qed correct are
clearli seen in the differ between rmbpt and experi variou relativist scheme
have alreadi been present in the electron structur theori and they are summar in
recent review articl 689
in the previou paper 10 we construct the theori of quantum electrodynam selfconsist field qedscf we deriv the timedepend hartreefock tdhf
theori hf condit and random phase approxim rpa 1112 becaus we construct our theori base on qed we regard them as an intrins treatment of relativist
theori in atom and molecul physic in thi theori we treat an nelectron system and
2
the dirac sea on an equal foot and they interact by exchang photon thu our theori
can treat the qed effect such as the vacuum polar effect which will be observ
around the nucleu of heavi element strong extern coulomb field 8913 to describ
the qed effect we have to treat not onli nelectron system but also the dirac sea as the
dynam degre of freedom in a manybodi system futhermor becaus we gain the
abil to introduc variou manybodi techniqu of atom and molecul to qed we can
discuss the avail of posthf scheme through consider of the qedhf stabil
condit like the gso model in the nonrelativist theori
thi paper is organ as follow in sec ii we give a brief summari of our method to
combin manybodi techniqu to qed in sec iii we perform grouptheoret character of qedscf solut 10 on the basi of timerevers pariti and o3 rotat
symmetri under these groupoper the firstord densiti matrix of these solut
is classifi into sever differ class in sec iv we give some exampl to appli our
method to quantum chemistri we examin the post qedscf method as in the case of
post hf method in quantum chemistri the mbpt coupledclust cc and mcscf
method are consid in the qed scheme to thi end we util previou procedur
for the nonrelativist case 14 1 use of densiti matrix 2 it diagon to obtain
the natur orbit given by fourcompon bispinor and 3 select of activ space for
mcscf final in sec v we give discuss about thi work
ii qedhf theori
in thi section we give a brief summari of our qedscf method which ha been investig in previou paper 10 our qedscf method is base on three factor first we
introduc a qed hamiltonian written by product of the oneparticl oper creationannihil oper second we introduc an assumpt for evalu of matrix
element third we use the thouless form for the determinant state 1115 by introduc these three tool it becom possibl to combin variou manybodi techniqu with

a hamiltonian
we start from the follow lagrangian

here a is a virtual photon field which describ the interact between fermion and
ae
is a classic extern field next we remov the photon degre of freedom and introduc
a coulomb potenti ur of a nucleu or nuclei as the extern field then we obtain
the follow hamiltonian

in the abov hamiltonian we expand each field oper by oneparticl state function as

where mean the electron positron state i denot quantum number for oneparticl state ai

is the fourcompon bispinor given like

here k l i j the energi differ of oneparticl state g is
usual metric tensor and defin as g diag1 1 1 1 about the interact we
onli take into account 0th order bare photon propag and choos the feynman gaug
for conveni thi hamiltonian can describ the qed effect such as the vacuumpolar becaus which includ the dirac sea as the dynam degre of freedom
hereaft we use thi hamiltonian in our theori
next we give the method for evalu of expect valu in qed the dirac vacuum
under the presenc of the extern coulomb field gener 4current as an observ effect
which is call the vacuum polar 8913 it is wellknown that thi effect is describ
by the charg conjug symmetr 4current given in the next form 8913

thi express give the 4current induc by the extern coulomb field in thi express
in the externalfieldfre case two sum cancel but for the field present case two sum do
not cancel complet herebi thi result should be interpret as describ the vacuum
polar effect which is induc by the extern coulomb field therefor the current
of nelectron system with ad the vacuum polar here we consid the case that
the nelectron occupi the oneparticl state up to the fermi level as illustr in fig 1
is given as

the second line give the vacuum polar 8913 to includ thi effect in our hamiltonian we have to modifi the contract scheme from the definit of the contract
a tb t f atbt f t t f bt atf t t
16
here at and bt are some kind of oper and f is a fermi sea we introduc the
definit for the step function at the same time as t t tt t ttt 12 then we
obtain the follow relat
f t atbt f

let us consid the fact that it is clear from the hamiltonian given in eq 3 the expect valu of it will be written in a function of the 4current j as same as the discuss in
ref 8 therefor we introduc a hypothesi that our hamiltonian is written by oper
in the sametim t product and when we factor the vacuum expect valu for an
oper product with the aid of the wick theorem each contract should be calcul
by the definit given in 17
is given by
by use the abov method for exampl the expect valu of h

thi give the hf energi in our theori we argu that we can gener thi method to
calcul expect valu for arbitrari product of oper by use the wick theorem
we alway factor the matrix element of an oper product into the sum of the product
of contract then the contract is calcul by the definit given abov it is clear
from the abov discuss that onli the definit of the contract for sametim oper
is modifi
b hf solut
now to obtain the relativist slater determin in the thouless form 11 we will
obtain a relativist exponenti oper which transform one to anoth represent
we assum the follow relat for the canon transform

where s1 s1 will be satisfi here new oper are expand by a complet set of the
old represent we introduc the exponenti oper in the follow form

eis1 exp i

23
here we demand that the matric form by the paramert mn mn mn
mn
should be
hermitian then the exponenti oper formal given abov is unitari it is clear that
the oper 23 will give the relat in 1922 we will write a relativist slater
determin as
eis1
0
24
here the slater determin of old represent is express by
a
i 0
0
25
i
and the dirac vacuum is defin by a
i 0 0 and bi 0 0
by use the relativist slater determin given abov we can write the expect
valu of our hamiltonian into an expand form by the same way as nonrelativist case
the expect valu of our hamiltonian is given as follow

in 26 the first line is the hf total energi the second line give the first deriv with
respect to the paramet and it must be zero in the hf condit the third
line correspond to the second deriv and they determin the stabil of the hf state

27
and it is equival to the stabil of collect mode in the rpa it is obviou fact that the
oper formal make possibl to do these discuss in qed we gave the evid
in previou paper 10 that by use our method we can deriv the tdhf equat hf
condit and rpa equat in qed with no inconsist thu we can obtain the most
stabl gener qed solut at the hf level

iii grouptheoret classif of gener qedhf
solut
a grouptheoret classif
in thi section we give a brief discuss of grouptheoret classif of the gener qedhf solut we firstli introduc the densiti matrix like the work of fukutom 16
q44 xx

28
here and are usual dirac field and they are 4compon bispinor thu our densiti
matrix is 44matrix as denot abov we can expand the 44 densiti matrix into the
16dimension complet set of matric
p
q44 qs i qv qt qa
5 q i5
29
in thi expans we take a convent that s denot the scalar v denot the vector
t denot the 2rank antisymmetr tensor a denot the axial vector and p denot the
pseudoscalar i is the 4 4 unitmatrix is usual dirac gamma matrix is defin as
2i and 5 i 0 1 2 3 thu we obtain the lorentz structur in our densiti
matrix q
in the relativist theori we usual treat the poincar group 4translat and the
lorentz group c charg conjug p pariti t timerevers under the
charg conjug and are transform as
c t
t c 1
30
then the densiti matrix is transform as
q c t c 1 cqt c 1

qs i qv qt qa

31
here c i 2 0 is the charg conjug matrix and t denot the transposit of matrix
under the time revers
t t t

32
togeth with the rule of take the complex conjug about cnumber we obtain

35
the qedhf solut can be grouptheoret classifi into sever type as in
the case of nonrelativist hf solut 16 to consid thi problem we determin the
symmetrygroup of a system in the atom or molecular system the translat invari
is broken in the case of an atom onli o3 rotat is remain in the lorentz group
in the case of a molecul o3 is replac by the point group under the o3 rotat
symmetri we expand the qs qp qv0 and q0a by the scalar spheric harmon while we
t
expand the qvi qa
i and q by the vector spheric harmon 17 it is clear from 33
and 35 the behavior of each type of the densiti matrix given in 29 under the spatial
invers and time revers depend not onli on the structur of the matrix but also on
the angular momentum of the spheric harmon let us consid the case of an atom we
treat the group g o3 p t here we introduc the subgroup of g as
10
o3 p t

for exampl o3 p t invari solut is given as

there is no case for o3 p invari solut o3 t invari solut is given as

39
due to the rotat symmetri each densiti matrix can onli have an swave compon
in all case 3739 all solut given abov are for close shell state we may have
magnet qedhf solut for system under discuss if time revers symmetri is
broken for exampl the case of 38 and 39
b nonrelativist limit
to consid the nonrelativist limit we take the standard represent the four
compon spinor is partit as 17
40
where is the larg compon and is the small compon then

therfor at the nonrelativist limit the qs and qv0 coincid with each other while the
p
s

qa
0 and q vanish note that on the other hand q and q vanish at the ultrarelativist
limit
t
under the presenc of the vectori densiti matric like the qvi qa
i and q the o3
rotat symmetri will be broken for p t p t and 1 no symmetryinvari
solut simpl classif is imposs becaus there are variou possibl of the
angular momentum depend of the q thi situat demand us futher investig
in more detail in the futur it must be note that we have to solv qedhf equat
to find which type of the densiti matric and solut will be realiz the natur
orbit analysi of a result solut is use to elucid the type and magnitud of broken
symmetri
iv post qedhf method
a qedcasscf and caspt2 method
the standard approach for inclus of fluctuat from the hf mean field approxim
is the mbpt approach 6 for the purpos the total hamiltonian in 9 is devid into
the zerothord and interact part as
0 h
k h
hf
h
i
45
int h
i h
ihf
h
46
hf denot the hf mean field interact potenti the remain interact
where h
i
int is regard as the perturb to the hf solut in the case of the mbpt approach 6
h
howev such singlerefer sr mbpt approach often break down in the case of
near degener ground state for which gener qedhf solut exist becaus of
the hf instabl in 27 11 to consid these problem we introduc the densiti matrix
which is defin as
12
ij
ij

47
where we write as then we diagon the densiti matrix of the most
stabl qedhf solut for system under consider 14 we obtain the natur orbit
given by fourcompon bispinor i
and mi as it occup number by use the
occup number mi we can select the activ space for treatment of the near degeneraci
effect 18 then the trial ci wavefunct for the qedmcscf are easili construct
the qedmcscf wavefunct is obtain like the nonrelativist case
0

here i is the configur state function csf ci is the ci coeffici and eis1 is

where t t and s1 s1 will be satisfi then we can write the transform energi as

50
thi express is at a glanc same as the nonrelativist case onli the definit of
the orbit rotat oper is differ from 50 we can formal deriv the variat
condit such as the gener brillouin theorem in our qed theori therefor the multirefer mr mbpt approach base on qedmcscf may be feasibl like caspt2 19
for the nonrelativist case
b qedcc and mrcc method
the coupledclust wave function 2022 can also be introduc to obtain dynam

v discuss
in thi paper we have develop our method which combin qed with manybodi
techniqu we have given the qed hamiltonian written by creationannhil opetr
and introduc the relativist slater determin in the thouless form we have perform
the grouptheoret classif of the densiti matrix after these prepar we have
discuss the possibl of the mcscf and coupledclust method in qed
now we discuss the relat between our theori and other relativist theori
in the context of the electron structur of atom there are three effect in atom the
electron correl the relativist effect and the qed effect 25 the electron structur
of atom is determin by the relat of these three factor the electron correl
depend on the electron number and can be treat by sever manybodi techniqu the
relativist effect becom larg with increas the atom number the relativist effect in
neutral or almost neutral heavi element can be treat satisfactorili by the diraccoulombbreit nosea scheme 6 as discuss in introduct
in fact our qed hamiltonian with neglect positron state and adopt onli the
densitydens interact taken into account will deriv the diraccoulomb hamiltonian 2627 as illustr in fig 3 futher we can have the diraccoulombbreit
hamiltonian with ad the breit oper moreov if the small compon is approxim by use the larg compon and take into account the fact that give small
contribut then the dirac equat can be reduc to the schrodingerpauli equat 28
for which 2compon spinor gso will correctli allow for relativist effect up to
vc2 these term will be calcul by ab initio gso program packag 45
15
on the other hand the case to describ the inner core electron of heavi element or
electron of highli ioniz heavi element such as lithiumlik uranium the qed effect can
not be neglect and we must take the dirac sea into account thi effect can be treat
by the perturb theori in qed 9 but thi method can onli take into account the
oneparticl qed correct practic thi method treat the system of atom with a few
electron for an illmin exampl of the qed effect fig 4 show the collis of two
uranium atom 29 thi collis gener the paircreat and the qed effect might
be appear clearli moreov the near orbit degeneraci effect will becom import in
thi case and also in cluster of these atom or ion
in the case of heavi atom as the ionic becom high and the electron number decreas the manybodi effect becom small and the qed effect becom larg therefor
we propos that our theori should be appli to the case where both the manybodi effect
and the qed effect can not be neglect heavi element in middl level of ionic should
be one of the subject for our theori the diraccoulombreit nosea scheme ha been appli to onli neutral or almost neutral atom the method of the qed correct work
onli for the highli ioniz heavi atom our theori should be suitabl for intermedi case
between them the collis of two uranium atom is also one of the interest subject of
our theori recent experi of xray irradi to cluster plasma are perform and
veriou new phenomena were studi 30 the cluster of heavi ion under middl revel of
ionic is now an interest subject in thi area the import of the relativist and
qed effect is discuss in such object fig 5 illustr scope and limit of these theori it is noteworthi that mani interest phenomena appear in the intermedi regim
even in the nonrelativist case 31 an applic of the qed scheme to treat the strong
electronelectron interact in solid state physic is also discuss in relat to spin densiti
wave and charg densiti wave state of mix valenc mv system 32
