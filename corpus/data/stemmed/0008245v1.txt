abstract
the approach to the ergod limit in mont carlo simul is studi use both analyt
and numer method with the help of a stochast model a metric is defin that enabl the
examin of a simul in both the ergod and nonergod regim in the nonergod regim
the model impli how the simul is expect to approach ergod behavior analyt and the
analyt infer decay law of the metric allow the monitor of the onset of ergod behavior
the metric is relat to previous defin measur develop for molecular dynam simul
and the metric enabl the comparison of the rel effici of differ mont carlo scheme
applic to lennardjon 13particl cluster are shown to match the model for metropoli
jwalk and parallel temper base approach the rel effici of these three mont
carlo approach are compar and the decay law is shown to be use in determin need high

length of the mc walk and variat of comput properti with k provid inform about the converg
of the simul on a long time scale
given an infinit time the stochast walker in a mc
simul visit everi allow point in configur
space 2 ergod behavior is reach when the length
of the walk is suffici long to sampl configur
space appropri 3 in practic thi doe not mean
that the space ha been dens cover but that everi
region with nonneglig probabl ha been reach
in such a case we can say that the simul is effect
ergod or that it ha reach the ergod limit
for a finit walk in the event of broken ergod 4
phase space is effect disconnect the differ disconnect region call compon are separ by
barrier of zero effect probabl if a stochast walker
start it walk in one of these region it may not cross the
barrier within the time of the simul if the simul length is increas some barrier may becom access for the walker and phase space is better sampl we
can conclud that a time exist such that for simul
length shorter than the walker becom trap in one
of the phase space compon for simul length
much larger than phase space is effect cover by
the walker
in thi studi we imagin a system have more than one
time scale 1 2 in a mont carlo simul each scale come from stochast process with

differ correl time 5 a precis definit of the
correl time for mont carlo process is given in
section iii but for the moment we can think of these correl time as ident to physic time scale of the
system under studi to understand these time scale more
fulli it is use to focu on an exampl prototyp of
system have such dispar time scale are atom and
molecular cluster typic cluster potenti surfac have
mani local minima separ by signific energi barrier 68 the local minima can be group into basin
of similar energi with each basin separ from other
basin again by energi barrier at short mont carlo
time a cluster system execut small amplitud oscil about one of it potenti minima we can think of
these vibrat time scale as the shortest time scale
that defin a cluster system as the simul time is
extend the system eventu hop between differ local minima within the same basin the time scale for
the first hop between local minima can be consid
the next shortest time scale for the simul at still
longer mont carlo time the system hop between differ energi basin defin yet anoth time scale for the
simul thi group of time scale continu until
the longest time scale for a given system is reach at
mont carlo time that are long compar to thi longest
time scale the simul is ergod
consid a system with sever time scale as mention
abov if the length of the simul is smaller than the
smallest correl time the walker may becom trap
in an effect disconnect region and the sampl of
phase space is incomplet by increas the time the
memori of the initi condit in the sampl decreas
as the walker cross to other previous unreach region these oscil and hop can be model by
a superposit of stochast process with differ correl time these process with nonzero correl
time are known as color nois process as oppos
to zero correl time white nois process 5 from
the studi of the autocorrel function of a stochast model defin use these color nois process we
can verifi that at a fix run length k there exist two
differ group of process those that contribut to the
autocorrel function with term that decay like 1k
call diffus process and those that contribut to
the autocorrel function with term that decay slower
than 1k call nondiffus process when the time
of the simul is increas some nondiffus process
at shorter run length start to contribut to the autocorrel function like diffus process after the walk
length reach the largest correl time all process
contribut to the autocorrel function with term that
decay like 1k at thi point the simul is at the diffus regim and effect ergod ha been reach
a princip goal of thi work is to investig the way in
which the mc output uk reach the diffus limit ie
the ergod limit by studi the properti of autocorrel function under chang of scale in time k bk
with b 1 by time scale it is possibl to infer the decay
2
law of the nondiffus contribut with respect to the
total simul time k the function depend of
the nondiffus contribut on the paramet b that is
use to scale k is determin empir we have found
the decay law so determin to be a particularli valuabl
method of conclud when a simul can be consid
ergod unlik previou studi 3911 that onli have
investig the behavior of certain autocorrel function in the ergod regim by focus on the approach
to ergod behavior we have a more care monitor of the
onset of ergod onc the nondiffus contribut
have decay to a point where they are too small to be
distinguish from zero to within the fluctuat of the
calcul we can say that the ergod limit ha been
reach
the autocorrel function we use to measur the
approach to the ergod limit are base on one of the
probe of ergod develop by thirumalai and cowork 3911 and is often call the energi metric
the energi metric ha been propos as an altern to
other techniqu 3 like the studi of the lyapunov expon 12 for the studi of ergod properti in molecular
dynam md simul the metric ha been use to
studi the rel effici of mc simul method
as well 13 the mc metric as use in the current work
can easili be extend from the energi to other scalar
observ of the system
we present two key issu in thi paper first from the
knowledg of the decay law of the nondiffus contribut to the mc metric we infer how long a simul
must be to be consid effect ergod second onc
the ergod limit is reach we can compar the result
from differ numer algorithm to measur rel
effici becaus the outcom of mc simul are
noisi we have found it use to separ diffus and
nondiffus term in the mc metric with a fourier analysi so that we can neglect the high frequenc compon of the nois thi techniqu ha given reproduc
result
to test the match between the stochast model and actual mont carlo simul we examin the approach
to ergod behavior in simul of lennardjon cluster recent 1415 we have studi the thermodynam
properti of lennardjon cluster as a function of temperatur use both jwalk 16 and parallel temper method 1719 both simul techniqu requir
an initi high temperatur that must be ergod when
metropoli mont carlo method 20 are use if the
metropoli method doe not give ergod result at the
initi high temperatur systemat error propag to
the lower temperatur in jwalk and parallel temper simul and the result can be flaw or meaningless in most mont carlo simul of cluster at
finit temperatur 2122 the cluster are defin by enclos the atom within a constrain potenti about
the center of mass of the system the constrain potenti is necessari becaus cluster at finit temperatur

each initi from a random configur over the
maximum time scale k of the walk it appar that the
potenti energi averag over each independ walk ha
not converg to the same result such unreproduc
behavior is symptomat of a simul not yet at the
ergod limit
vk
atom with the cluster can be illdefin from experi
141523 we have found that if the radiu of the constrain potenti and the initi high temperatur are
not both care chosen it can be difficult to attain ergod with metropoli method a key concern then is
the choic of constrain radiu and the choic of initi
temperatur we verifi the stochast model by investig mont carlo simul result as a function of the
temperatur and the size of the constrain potenti
the content of the remaind of thi paper are as follow in section ii we motiv the studi that follow by
examin numer the behavior of a set of mont carlo
simul of a 13particl lennardjon cluster thi
cluster system is use to illustr the result throughout thi paper in section iii we introduc the stochast
model base on a continu time sequenc in section

we test the discret stochast model with applic to

where ak and bk are coeffici that are depend on
the total walk length k as k is increas to a time
where the walk is ergod bk must decay to zero major
goal of thi work are to understand how bk decay and
to use the discov decay law to determin the onset
of ergod behavior our approach is to introduc first a
continu stochast model of a simul follow by a
discret model more clearli link to actual mc studi
iii stochast model
we have discuss in the introduct how the output
of mc simul can be consid to be a combin
of stochast process with differ time scale and how
the contribut to autocorrel function from these
process can vari when the length of the simul is
enlarg here we present a continu time model for
the stochast process that occur in a simul even
though a mc simul occur in a discret time each
mc point repres a time unit we find that the continu model help to understand better the idea use
in the model of the mc output
in thi section the ensembl mean valu is use to find
the express for the autocorrel function of the
model although in actual numer calcul the ensembl mean is replac by a mean over a finit number
of independ experi the result obtain here give
inform about the limit of an infinit sampl
the stationari process use to sampl space is a
stochast process we assum the output of the mc simul can be model by a linear superposit of stochast process with differ correl time 0

even though simpler than eq 56 we have found eq
57 is more sensit to the deviat of dk from the approxim eq 46 therefor the data obtain from
the real part is of poorer qualiti than the data obtain
from the imaginari part
equat 56 impli that for a given simul length
k the contribut to the mc metric from the nondiffus process can be determin from a simpl relationship involv the fourier transform of the function
kdk at low frequenc by increas the length of the

cluster the rapid chang in thermodynam properti
occur over a finit temperatur interv to distinguish
the temperatur rang where thermodynam properti
chang rapidli in cluster from a true phase transit
we follow berri et al 25 and refer to such chang in
physic properti as associ with a phase chang a

093 003 for pt and 094 002 for met the straight

we have state that the simul can be consid

fig 6 comparison of the met and jw diffus coeffici
with the pt diffus coeffici as a function of the reduc temperatur the dash line repres equival between method
by use the result to compar the rel effici
of met jw and pt simul for the lj13 system we
have found that pt and jw simul can be consid
ergod if the run length is on the order of 2 105 pass
while met simul that are initi from configur gener from an ergod pt studi are ergod
when the total run length consist of 2 106 pass or
more
in order to compar approach we have calcul

differ algorithm ha also been use by andricioaei and
straub 13 the comparison of jw and met with pt is
present in fig 6 the jw and pt simul are found
to have compar effici use as a measur for all
calcul temperatur at intermedi temperatur
met is significantli less effici we have chosen to truncat the jw studi at kb t 012 for temperatur

vi conclus
in thi paper we have present a studi of the approach
to the ergod limit in mc simul in all the case
examin the behavior of the mc metric dk can be approxim by eq 46 and the behavior of bk satisfi
eq 48 becaus the expon is smaller than one for
all the case studi the depend of the nondiffus
contribut on dk is weaker in the sens of appendix
a than the diffus contribut the assumpt on
which we have built the stochast model have been verifi numer for a system have a suffici complex
potenti surfac to be view as prototyp of a larg
set of manyparticl system
the mc metric use in thi work appear to be a valuabl tool to studi the ergod properti of mc simul the nonergod compon of the mc metric
enabl the predict of the minimum length a mc simul must have in order to be consid ergod the
comparison of from differ algorithm give a reason estim of their rel effici
from the studi of the melt region of 13 particl cluster we have found that the expon depend both on
the method use and the natur of the potenti energi
function we have perform calcul not discuss
in thi work where the function form of the potenti
energi is modifi these studi have shown to be
depend on the detail of the potenti we have not
found the expon to be a strong function of method
although pt and met have significantli differ effici as measur by their rel diffus coeffici is
nearli the same in the two method the differ in the
decay of k appear to be domin by the coeffici
in eqs48 and 52 rather than the expon
as discuss in the text parallel temper and jwalk studi of manyparticl system must have an
initi high temperatur compon that is chosen so that
a met simul is known to be ergod for cluster simul that requir an extern constrain potenti to
defin the cluster the radiu of the constrain potenti must be care chosen in order to achiev ergod
result we have found the metric and associ decay
law develop in thi work to be a particularli valuabl
method of choos these initi paramet in both parallel temper and jwalk simul
we also remark that the metric introduc here may be
a more sensit probe of ergod than may be requir
in some applic for exampl in previou jwalk
studi 26 of the 13particl lennardjon cluster the
heat capac curv determin with a constrain radiu
of 4 is nearli indistinguish from the curv obtain
with a constrain radiu of 2 from the result of thi
12
work we know the initi high temperatur walk is not
ergod when a constrain radiu of 4 is use it is
strike that the nonergod as measur by the energi metric is not appar in the heat capac curv
we have construct a metric base on an ensembl of
mc trajectori by use an ensembl we attempt to
cover suffici portion of space so that all compon
are access in practic onli a finit subset of a full
ensembl can be includ and it is alway possibl that
compon of space are miss in such a case k may
decay to zero numer within the subspac and the behavior may give mislead evid that the simul
is ergod becaus compon of space may be miss in
ani finit simul it is imposs to guarante ergod it is hope by use a suffici larg ensembl of
trajectori to defin the metric the possibl of miss
compon is minim

a time 0 t t such that 0 f t f t in contradict with eq a50 then f must be nonneg
for t 0 t by the properti eq 19 f 0 must be
posit thi prove that nd 1 t t b d t t b
f t 0 for 0 t t to demonstr that if f is posit yield nd 1 t t b d t t b ie the convers
follow the argument backward from eq a30
in conclus if the memori function are posit satisfi the lipschitz condit and satisfi the condit eq

in thi appendix we show the behavior of the function f1 when it correl time is chang accord to

first color nois process
we multipli the time variabl by a number b such that
