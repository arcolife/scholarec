introduct
the equat of hydrodynam are nonlinear partial differenti equat so
they includ the possibl of form singular in finit time thi mean
that hydrodynam field becom infinit or at least nonsmooth at point line
or even fractal object thi mathemat possibl is the price one ha to pay
for the enorm conceptu simplif a continuum theori bring for the
descript of a manyparticl system near singular the microscop structur reemerg as the flow chang over arbitrarili small distanc eventu
the singular is cut off by some microscop length scale such as the distanc
between molecul
the most fundament question is whether the microscop structur becom relev for featur of the flow much larger than the microscop one
if thi is the case the continuum descript is no longer selfconsist but
ha to be supplement by microscop inform there are some wellknown
case where singular are artifact of neglect diffus effect like viscos in the hydrodynam equat and there is no more smooth on small
scale exampl are the singular wide believ to be produc by the
threedimension euler equat majda 1991 or those of heleshaw flow at
zero surfac tension dai kadanoff and zhou 1991 there doe not seem to
be a direct correspond between the intric structur of spatial singular produc by these equat and real flow for a realist descript of
experi some tini amount of viscos or surfac tension need to be ad
the reason hydrodynam singular have nevertheless attract consider attent in recent year is the observ that certain singular have
direct physic signific and are not a consequ of inadequaci of the
equat in particular freesurfac flow exhibit a rich varieti of experiment
observ singular which are respons for phenomena like the breakup
of jet coalesc of drop and bubbl entrain

physic singular
we attempt to divid these physic singular into two categori

dynam singular
these are singular which are confin to a point in time usual they are
associ with topolog transit like the breakup of a piec of fluid into two
piec or the join of two piec into one for exampl the breakup of a viscou
jet of fluid is driven by surfac tension which tri to reduc the surfac area by
diminish the radiu of the jet egger 1997a inerti forc constrain the
motion to becom more and more local sinc smaller and smaller amount
of fluid have to move thi caus the jet to break at a point in finit time
onli the smooth effect of viscos prevent infinit gradient from occur
befor the local radiu goe to zero
as the local radiu of a fluid thread becom smaller and smaller dure
pinch it inevit reach a microscop scale micro where the equat
ceas to be valid for thread diamet between 10 and 100 nm shortrang
van der waal forc come into play and for even smaller diamet the concept of a sharp interfac will certainli loos it mean moreov a stabil
analysi brenner shi and nagel 1994 show that the pinch thread is veri
sensit to thermal fluctuat thi make even thread of micron size unstabl and lead to a new structur of nest singular driven by microscop
fluctuat after the thread ha dissolv new surfac form on either side
whose rapid retract is again govern by the navierstok equat but with
a new topolog it would appear as if the continu to the new navierstok
problem should necessarili includ the microscop length micro at which the
thread broke thi is howev not the case egger 1997a as long as one is
look at scale much larger than micro name the final stage occur on veri
small spatial and tempor scale and do not affect the flow at a finit distanc
away from breakup thu the outer part of the solut can be use as a boundari condit for the new problem after breakup a closer analysi reveal that
thi is suffici to determin the new solut complet thi mean that the
dynam veri quickli forget the microscop detail of break thu make
a consist hydrodynam theori of the topolog transit possibl

persist singular
the other import categori of singular are those which exist for a period of
time be either stationari or move about in space like the classic exampl
of a shock wave at finit viscos a shock wave is not a true singular but
maintain a finit width determin by the ratio of the viscos and the shock
strength howev the width of the shock wave is typic of the same order as
the mean free path of the ga it is move in what is import is thu the fact
that the solut remain consist as goe to zero inde the dissip
insid the shock remain finit in thi limit so on scale much larger than the
flow field is the same as if were zero
in the realm of freesurfac flow a beauti exampl of a stationari singular ha been discov recent on the surfac of the viscou flow between two
hydrodynam singular

cylind rotat speed and radiu respect at a critic capillari number
the surfac appear to form a cusp as indic in fig1 sinc the flow remain
twodimension thi correspond to a line of singular of the surfac assum that it is a true cusp the origin author analyz the flow use a solut
due to richardson 1968 thi local solut lead to a logarithm diverg
of the dissip and thu cannot be consist with continuum theori or a finit drive power it wa therefor suggest that the diverg is regular
by some microscop scale sinc the singular is veri weak the dissip at
the tip would still be small for realist valu of the microscop length howev thi explan for elimin the logarithm diverg would mean
that there is a depend of the macroscop flow on a microscop paramet
face with thi possibl the problem wa reanalyz by jeong and moffatt
1992 who solv the stoke equat exactli make the simplifi assumpt that the two roller can be repres by a singl dipol the remark

result of their calcul is that the radiu of curvatur r at the tip is in fact
finit but exponenti small in the capillari number
r r0 exp 32ca
2
for realist valu of the capillari number thi give radii of curvatur far below
ani physic scale but is still abl to regular the logarithm singular thu
one find a finit valu of the energi dissip make the macroscop flow
independ of the microscop paramet of the fluid
for practic purpos the theoret valu of r is far too small to be realist rather it most like is the ga abov the fluid which will set the valu
of r and thi physic effect ha been neglect so far becaus of the noslip
boundari condit ga will be forc into the narrow channel form by the
cusp a simpl calcul base on lubric theori show that for r 0 thi
will lead to a diverg pressur at the tip of the cusp thu the ga will forc
the channel to widen to a finit radiu at which the ga pressur is compar
to the pressur insid the fluid
it is worth note that the independ from microscop paramet is by
no mean selfevid a famou counterexampl is that of a move contact
line which occur for exampl when a circular drop is allow to spread on the
surfac of a tabl de genn 1985 brenner and bertozzi 1993 use kinemat argument alon one show that there will be a logarithm singular
of the energi dissip at the move contact line there is a vast literatur
on thi problem deal either with possibl mechan for a microscop cutoff or with a consist mathemat descript of the result macroscop
dynam the import point to note is that continuum mechan alon cannot resolv the problem in a selfconsist fashion it would predict that the
spread of the drop is stall contradict observ

scale
the central assumpt behind the descript of singular is that of local
their spatial and tempor scale becom arbitrarili small so that the dynam
should be remov from the largescal featur of the flow howev consist
between the singular and the larg scale dynam ha to be assur by match
condit between the inner and the outer problem
a second close relat assumpt is that of selfsimilar of the singular
flow which seem a natur concept for a class of problem which lack a typic
lengthscal in the case of timedepend singular it mean that the interfac shape at differ time can be map on one anoth by an appropri
rescal of the axe for exampl the surfac profil of the pinch singular
when a fluid thread break is egger 1997a

the bridg between the drop is much smaller than the minimum radiu r
what could possibl keep the local motion from behav in a selfsimilar
fashion two exampl for broken selfsimilar come from the coalesc of
two drop when two drop meet a point surfac tension will tri to merg
them into one drop so the minimum radiu r of the bridg between the drop
will increas fig2 as long as the bridg is veri small inerti effect can
be neglect and the problem is initi govern by the stoke equat for
geometr reason the width of the bridg w is much smaller than the minimum

is the onli possibl power law time depend of the radiu howev a closer
analysi reveal egger lister and stone 1997 that 5 ha to be correct
by a logarithm factor logrr where r is the initi radiu of a drop the
reason for thi chang of the time depend lie in the longrang charact of
the stoke equat which coupl veri dispar length scale henc the width
of the bridg cannot be neglect but enter as a logarithm factor logwr

anoth mechan for broken selfsimilar is observ for the same problem but for much smaller initi size of the drop in that case the surfacetensiondriven motion will first occur on the surfac alon rather than be
abl to drive a flow in the interior the equat of motion for thi surfac diffus wa first given by mullin 1965 base on simpl scale argument

as the evolut of the radiu but thi result could not be corrobor by
hi own numer simul to understand thi failur one need to take a
closer look at the dynam near the rise bridg egger 1997b in contrast
to the viscou flow problem as the gap between the two sphere fill a bulg of
materi form just abov the minimum eventu it grow enough for both
side to touch form a void insid the materi of cours at the point of
touch a new singular occur and the topolog of the problem ha chang
the naiv assumpt of a singl continu evolut underli 6 is thu
incorrect selfsimilar can at best exist in a discret sens

birth of new structur
if one drive the tworol apparatu of fig1 much harder than necessari for
the format of a cusp a second transit occur abov which a thin sheet of
air eman from the cusp and is drawn continu into the fluid thi sheet
is stabl in time but undergo a threedimension instabl at it lower end
where it decay into a curtain of tini droplet thi provid a gener mechan for the entrain of bubbl into a flow the exist of the sheet wa
point out by moffatt 1994 and confirm in a seri of qualit experi egger and smock 1996 use a silicon oil 10000 time as viscou
as water at suffici high drive the air forc into the cusp experi a
strong enough downward pull to form a stabl sheet a preliminari calcul
suggest that the thick of the sheet scale like

thi predict is base on the assumpt that there is a return flow in the
sheet which produc veri high gradient so when the sheet becom veri thin
the inner flow is abl to balanc the high sheer stress produc by the viscou
flow both surfac tension and graviti are not taken into account

imag height is 05 mm photograph courtesi h leonhard
similar phenomena have been observ for a varieti of other stationari singular an exampl known as tipstream taylor 1934de bruijn 1993
is shown in fig3 one see a drop of water in a shear flow of a veri viscou
fluid which produc a coneshap singular at both end of the drop under
circumst that are not well understood a jet eman from the tip and
eventu decay into drop due to the rayleigh capillari instabl thi is the
precis analogu of the sheet in the tworol apparatu but the dimens of
the singular and of the result structur are lower by one a second exampl of a zerodimension singular give rise to a onedimension structur
is that of a dielectr drop in a strong electr field where a local coneshap
solut exist taylor 1964 thi taylor cone is never stabl but either
oscil between a round and a point state or stabil itself by eject
a jet from it tip again littl is known about the condit under which the jet
formsbut the strike similar between differ system suggest a unifi
explan for the emerg of these structur
