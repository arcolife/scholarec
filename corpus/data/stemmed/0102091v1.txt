i discuss lhc signatur of the charg higg boson of the mssm focuss mainli
on the case of the h be heavier than top quark
the minim supersymmetr standard model mssm contain two complex hig doublet 1 and 2 correspond to eight scalar state three of these are absorb as goldston boson leav five physic state the two neutral scalar h0 h 0 a pseudoscalar
a0 and a pair of charg higg boson h all the treelevel mass and coupl of
these particl are given in term of two paramet mh and tan the latter repres
the ratio of the two vacuum expect valu 1 while ani one of the abov neutral higg
boson may be hard to distinguish from that of the standard model the h carri a distinct hallmark of the susi higg sector moreov the coupl of the h are uniqu
relat to tan sinc the physic charg higg boson correspond to the combin
h
1 sin 2 co

therefor the detect of h and measur of it mass and coupl are expect to
play a veri import role in probe the susi higg sector
the t bh decay is known to provid promis signatur for charg higg boson
search at tevatron upgrad and lhc for mh mt 2 but it is hard to extend the h
search beyond mt becaus in thi case the combin of domin product and decay
channel th ttb suffer from a larg qcd background 3 moreov the subdomin

product channel of h w and h h have been found to give no viabl signatur at
lhc 4 in view of thi we have undertaken a systemat studi of a heavi h signatur at
lhc from it domin product channel th th follow by the decay h tb
and w h0 while the 1st repres the domin decay channel of charg higg boson
the and w h0 are the largest subdomin channel in the high and low tan region
respect with
b tan

the signatur for the domin decay channel of h tb ha been analys separ
assum three and four btag the analys are gener base on parton level mont
carlo program with gaussian smear of lepton and jet momenta for simul detector

is impos on all the jet and lepton momenta the pt cut is also impos on the missingpt
obtain by vector addit of the pt s after resolut smear thi is follow by the
mass reconstruct of the w and the top quark pair so that one can identifi the pair
of bjet accompani the latter while the harder of these two bjet b1 come from
h decay in the signal both of them come mainli from gluon split in the background
consequ the sb ratio is improv by impos the follow cut on thi bjet pair

then each of thi bjet pair is combin with each of the reconstruct pair of top to give
4 entri for the invari mass mtb per event one of these 4 entri correspond to the
h mass for the signal event while the other constitut a combinatori background fig
1 show thi tb invari mass distribut for the signal 3 and background 4 the
right hand scale correspond to the crosssect for 4b 01 ie an optimist btag
effici of b 056 reduc it to a more conserv valu of b 04 would reduc
both the signal and background by a factor of 4 each

tabl 1 list the number of signal and background event for a typic annual luminos of
100 fb1 expect from the high luminos lhc run assum b 04 while the sb
ratio is 1 the viabil of the signal is limit by the signal size2 one expect a 3
signal upto mh 600 gev at tan 40 the signal size is veri similar at tan 15
but smaller in between the reason the extrem valu of tan are favour is that the
signal process 3 is control by the tbh yukawa coupl

which is larg for tan 1 and mt mb interestingli these two region of tan are
favour by b unif for a relat reason ie one need a larg tbh yukawa
coupl contribut to the rge to control the rise of mb as one goe down from the gut
to the low energi scale 6
ii h tb signatur with three btag 7
the contribut to thi signal come from 3 as well as
gb th hc ttb hc
9
follow by the lepton decay of one top and hadron decay of the other the signal crosssect from 9 is 23 time larger than from 3 while their kinemat distribut are veri
similar combin the two and subtract the overlap piec to avoid doubl count
8 result in a signal crosssect which is midway between the two the background
come from 4 as well as
gb ttb hc and gg ttg

2
increas the pt cut of bjet from 20 to 30 gev would reduc the signal background size by a factor
of about 34 henc reduc the viabil of thi signal
3
where the gluon jet in the last case is mistag as a bjet assum the standard mistag
factor of 1 thi contribut turn out in fact to be the largest sourc of the background
as we see below
the basic kinemat cut are as in 6 except for a harder pt cut pt 30 gev sinc the
3 bjet come from h and tt decay are all reason hard thi is follow by the mass
reconstruct of the top quark pair as befor so that one can identifi the accompani
3rd bjet we impos a pt 80 gev cut on thi bjet to improv the sb ratio final
thi bjet is combin with each of the reconstruct top pair to give two entri of mtb per
event one of them correspond to the h mass for the signal while the other constitut the
combinatori background fig 2 show thi tb invari mass distribut of the signal along
with the abov mention background includ a btag effici factor of b 04
while the sb ratio is 1 the signal crosssect is much larger than the previou case
tabl 2 list the number of signal and background event for a luminos of 100 fb1 at
tan 40
the result are veri similar at tan 15 compar thi with tabl 1 we see
that the s b ratio is veri similar in the two channel one should bear in mind howev
the larger pt cut assum for the 3 btag channel the crosssect in both the case
were calcul with the mrslo structur function 9

follow by the 1prong hadron decay of the signal contain a hard a posit polar
while the background contain a rel soft and neg polar from w boson
decay the polar differ can be exploit to sharpen the signal by simpli requir
the charg pion to carri 80 of the visibl momentum fig 3 show the signal and
background crosssect against the transvers mass of the jet with the missingpt we
see that by exploit the polar differ one can get a clean h signal in thi channel
for the larg tan region at the level of a few fb thi ha been recent confirm by a
more detail simul by the cm collabor includ detector accept 11
iv h w h0 signatur 12
we have estim the signal crosssect from
gb th hc bw w h0 hc
13
follow by h0 bb w and w q q thu the final state consist of the
same particl as the domin decay mode of eq 9 therefor we have to consid the
background from the h tb decay 9 along with those from the qcd process of eq
10
we requir 3 btag along with the same basic cut as in section ii thi is follow by
the mass reconstruct of w and the top which help to identifi the accompani bpair
and the w the result bb and w b invari mass are then subject to the constraint
mbb mh0 10 gev and mw b mt 20 gev
14
the h0 mass constraint and the veto on the second top help to distinguish the h w h0
signal from the background howev the former is sever constrain by the signal size
as well as the sb ratio consequ one expect at best a margin signal in thi channel
and that too onli in a narrow strip of the mh tan paramet space at the boundari
of the lep exclus region fig 4 show the signal 13 along with the background from
9 and 10 against the reconstruct h mass at one such point mh 220 gev and
tan 2
the lep limit of mh0 ma0 100 gev in the low tan region impli that the h
w h0 w a0 decay channel ha as high a threshold as the tb channel while the latter ha a
more favour coupl consequ the h w h0 w a0 decay br is restrict to
5 over the lep allow region 13 howev the lep constraint doe not hold in
be
singlet extens of the mssm like the nmssm 14 consequ the h w h0 w a0
can be the domin decay mode for mh 160 gev in the low tan region and lead to a
spectacular signal at the lhc as is illustr in 12 one need a systemat analysi of
the lhc signatur for both neutral and charg higg boson in the nmssm particularli
in the low tan region
it should be mention here that these parton level mont carlo analys of the h
signatur in tb and w h0 decay channel need to be follow up by detail simul with
pythia includ detector accept as in the case of the channel 11 final
it should be note that practic all the analys of h signal so far are base on the
lowest order product vertex repres by the yukawa coupl of eq 8 one loop
5
electroweak correct to thi vertex can give upto 10 20 reduct in the signal crosssect at high low tan as recent shown in 15 the correspond correct from
qcd loop is expect to be larger but not yet avail thi is evid import for a
quantit evalu of thi signal one should also bear in mind the possibl of a larg
correct to thi vertex from susi loop depend on the choic of susi paramet 16
