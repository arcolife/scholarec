abstract
in previou work the dynam of the elast rod wa recast in a lax pair
formul with fiduci arc length s and time t as continu independ
variabl howev the solut of these equat cannot appli directli to a
system where the fiduci arc length s is a discret variabl in thi paper we show
how to discret the continu s variabl in a way that preserv the integr
of the origin system the t paramet is not discret so thi algorithm will be
especi use for solut of the sdiscret and tcontinu elast rod
problem as may occur in problem where the polymer structur of the dna is
made explicit
i introduct
in paper i1 we deriv a lax pair for the geometr exact hamiltonian
equat for the elast rod prove that the problem is integr in gener in
thi paper we provid a similar lax pair reformul but with integr
discret of the fiduci arc length s the other independ variabl the time
t remain continu in a follow paper iii2 both s and t will be discret to
permit integr dynam solut
ii the configur space of the elast rod in 3d
we treat duplex dna as a bendabl twistabl extens and shearabl
thin discret elast rod here and elsewher in thi paper the term elast rod
and dna have the same mean so do the centerlin of the rod and the axi
of dna
let k be an integ that discret the continu variabl s thu we will
express ani function f s t as f k s t or more briefli as f k t at a given time
t and at each point s k s on the centerlin r k t of the rod a local cartesian
coordin frame or director frame d 1 k t d 2 k t d 3 k t is affix with the
unit vector d 1 k t and d 2 k t in the direct of the princip axe of inertia
tensor of the rod cross section the third unit vector d 3 k t is in the normal
direct of the cross section becaus the shear is includ the unit vector d 3 k t

at ani time t and a given posit say s s1 along the centerlin there is
a cross section of the elast rod upon which the intern forc are exert one
side of the cross section s s1 act on the other side s s1 and vice versa the
intern forc are resolv into a forc ps1 t and a torqu m s1 t at each
cross section such a forc and a torqu may be found give rise to function

system 39 and 311 can describ a veri larg class of differentialdiffer

in paper i we discuss the similar and differ between the lax pair
formul of the elast rod problem and the more gener lax pair formul
of doliwa and santini3 for the kinemat of a move space curv of ani kind
the same idea appli when the problem is sdiscret but the discuss differ

also be deriv from a system of differenti differ equat in 39 with

is better to consid the motion of not just unit vector s f1 but rather the motion
of all unit vector fj j 1 2 7 8 togeth in 11 dimens
vi conclus
1 we have found a lax pair with a correspond spectral paramet for a system
of 12 scalar differentialdifferenceequ and 12 scalar constitut relat
govern 24 depend variabl in 11 dimens
2 when the spectral paramet goe to zero thi system of differentialdifferenceequ reduc to the sdiscret smk equat that describ the
dynam of dna model as a shearabl and extens discret elast rod
3 when three depend variabl are set to be constant the sdiscret smk
equat reduc to a system of 9 scalar differentialdifferenceequ with 9
scalar constitut relat in 18 depend variabl thi system describ the
dynam of dna model as an unshear and inextens discret elast rod
discet kirchhoff elast rod
4 when the sdiscret smk equat are assum to be independ of t they
reduc to a set of 6 differenceequ and 3 constitut relat for 9
depend variabl describ the discret motion of a heavi top
5 when the sdiscret smk equat are assum to be independ of k they
reduc to a set of 6 ode and 3 constitut relat for 9 depend variabl
describ the motion of a rigid bodi in an ideal fluid
