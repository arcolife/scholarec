we studi the 38atom lennardjon cluster with parallel temper mont
carlo method in the microcanon and molecular dynam ensembl a
new mont carlo algorithm is present that sampl rigor the molecular
dynam ensembl for a system at constant total energi linear and angular
momenta by combin the parallel temper techniqu with molecular dynam method we develop a hybrid method to overcom quasiergod
and to extract both equilibrium and dynam properti from mont carlo
and molecular dynam simul sever thermodynam structur and
dynam properti are investig for lj38 includ the calor curv
the diffus constant and the largest lyapunov expon the import
of insur ergod in molecular dynam simul is illustr by compar the result of ergod simul with earlier molecular dynam simul

i introduct
the simul of system have complex potenti energi surfac pe is often difficult owe to the problem of quasiergod quasiergod can aris in system have
sever energi minima separ by high energi barrier when such situat occur as
for exampl in protein glass or cluster the system can becom trap in local basin
of the energi landscap and the ergod hypothesi fail on the time scale of the simul
in the canon ensembl the high energi region of the pe are exponenti suppress
and barrier cross becom rare event calcul of equilibrium properti when phase
space is thu partit requir method that overcom quasiergod by enhanc barrier cross mani techniqu have been propos to address thi problem includ the
use of gener ensembl such as multicanonical1 or tsallisian23 simul tempering4
configurational5 or forc bias6 mont carlo or variou version of the jumpwalking711 algorithm most of these techniqu have been introduc for mont carlo mc simul
rather than molecular dynam md simul these techniqu have been appli to
a varieti of sampl and optim problem and phase chang in cluster have often
been consid as a benchmark to test these methods21011
the doublefunnel energi landscap of the 38atom lennardjon lj cluster ha been
investig in detail by doy miller and wales1215 who recent also estim the interfunnel rate constant use master equat dynamics13 thi landscap is challeng for
simul becaus of the high freeenergi barrier separ the two funnels14 in the preced paper hereaft refer to as i16 we have shown how the parallel temper algorithm
can be use to deal with thi particularli complex system for mont carlo simul in
the canon ensembl achiev ergod in microcanon simul is much harder
than in the canon ensembl becaus the system is unabl to cross ani energi barrier
higher than the total energi avail the 38atom lennardjon cluster is fundament
nonergod in a rang of energi thi nonergod may not be a seriou problem when
consid one particular cluster on a short time scale howev in a statist sampl of
such system it is import to have ergod result
to allow md simul to cross the high energi barrier one may think of heat the
system by increas it kinet energi follow by a cool back to it initi thermodynam state although thi process is straightforward the dynam becom bias and
non physic dure the heat and cool process moreov it is difficult to control
accur the heat and cool rate that should be chosen for ani system thi latter
aspect is particularli critic for the 38atom lennardjon cluster where the narrow and
deepest funnel is hard to reach even at high temperatur
becaus of the inher difficulti of molecular dynam mc approach can be especi use for deal with the problem of cross high energi barrier mont carlo
method have been develop in previou work1017 in the microcanon ensembl in
these approach the microcanon sampl is at fix energi without ani addit
constraint such method can be contrast with isoenerget molecular dynam where
the total linear and angular momenta are also conserv these addit constraint must
be consid even at zero angular momentum1820 to differenti microcanon simul where onli the energi is fix from molecular dynam simul where addit
constraint are impos we identifi the former to be simul in the microcanon ensembl and identifi the latter simul to be in the molecular dynam ensembl the
differ in the two ensembl can be particularli import when the angular momentum
is larg enough to induc structur centrifug distortions20 becaus dynam properti
are calcul use molecular dynam method in thi work we find that a combin
of mont carlo and molecular dynam method are most conveni for develop ergod
approach to dynam
in thi paper we adapt the parallel temper method to both the microcanon and
molecular dynam ensembl the applic of parallel temper in the molecular dynam ensembl requir the incorpor of the conserv of the total linear and angular
momenta into the probabl in order to extract ergod dynam properti we combin mont carlo method with molecular dynam to develop a hybrid ergod mcmd
algorithm the effici of the simul tool develop in thi work is demonstr by
applic to the 38atom lennardjon cluster which exhibit a solidsolid transit
prior to melting1316 thi transit to an equilibrium phase between truncat octahedr
and icosahedr geometri make thi cluster an ideal candid for investig how the
ergod hypothesi can influenc the dynam behavior of a complex system
the content of the remaind of thi paper are as follow in the next section we recal the basic principl of mont carlo sampl in the microcanon ensembl and we
present the simpl modif need to includ parallel temper we test microcanon parallel temper method on the 38atom lennardjon cluster and compar the
microcanon result with those found in i use the canon ensembl we focu on
equilibrium properti includ the calor curv and the isom distribut in section
iii we review the characterist of the molecular dynam ensembl at fix total linear
and angular momenta and fix total energi we extend the parallel temper mont
carlo method to the md ensembl and we combin microcanon parallel temper with
molecular dynam to produc an ergod md method we also appli these method to
sever dynam properti of lj38 in particular the diffus constant and the largest
lyapunov expon we summar our find and discuss our result in section iv

the fundament quantiti in the microcanon ensembl is the densiti of state for
a system have n ident particl volum v and total energi e is defin by

where h is planck constant and where hr p denot the classic hamiltonian function of
the coordin r and momenta p of the n particl know the microcanon densiti

the microcanon entropi s can be defin by sn v e kb ln n v e with kb the

definit of the temperatur base on differ from the temperatur base on to order
1n and the two definit agre onli in the thermodynam limit
mont carlo simul can be use to explor the microcanon ensembl by perform a random walk in configur space in the standard metropoli scheme a trial
move from configur ro to configur rn is accept with the probability22

e ro t ro rn

where t ro rn is a trial probabl the accept probabl express in eq6
insur detail balanc so that the random walk visit point in configur space proport to the equilibrium distribut e r defin by
e r 1e ure ur3n21

where is the normal in practic t ro rn is a uniform distribut of point of
width center about ro and is adjust as a function of the energi so that not too
mani trial move are either accept or reject
implement of microcanon mont carlo is as easi as it canon version becaus mont carlo method are base on random walk in configur space in principl
the system can cross energi barrier higher than the avail energi howev in difficult
case like lj38 larg atom displac have poor accept ratio are need to reach
ergod
parallel tempering2326 ha prove to be an import approach to insur ergod
in canon mont carlo simul and parallel temper can be easili adapt to the
microcanon ensembl by replac the boltzmann factor in the accept probabl by
the microcanon weight e r in the parallel temper scheme sever microcanon
mc simul are perform simultan at differ total energi ei with some
predetermin probabl two simul at energi ei and ej attempt to exchang their
current configur respect ri and rj and thi exchang is accept with probabl
min 1
ei rj ej ri
ei ri ej rj
the accept ratio is analog to the canon express given in i in microcanon
simul the potenti energi must be smaller than minei ej otherwis the move
is reject parallel temper microcanon mc work in the same way as in standard
canon mc as with canon parallel temper mc the gap between adjac total
energi must be chosen to be small enough so that exchang between the correspond
trajectori are accept with a reason probabl
by use a histogram reweight technique27 it is possibl to extract from the mc
simul the densiti of state and then all the thermodynam quantiti in both the
microcanon and the canon ensembl the procedur is similar to that describ
in ref 28 and reli on the calcul of the distribut p u e of potenti energi
u at the total energi e p is fit to the microcanon form p u e c ue
u3n21 e where c stand for the configur densiti of state and e is
extract by convolut of c u and e u3n21
we have test the parallel temper mont carlo algorithm in the microcanon
ensembl on the 38atom lennardjon cluster previous investig forti differ total energi rang from 1724737 to 124 have been use and the same simul
condit have been chosen as in i in addit to a constrain sphere of radiu 225 to
prevent evapor exchang have been attempt everi 10 pass with the same method
for choos exchang trajectori as describ in the previou articl the simul are
begun with random configur of the cluster geometri and consist of 13 1010 point
accumul follow equilibr move consist of 95 106 metropoli pointsno exchang follow by 190 106 point use parallel temper the microcanon heat
capac calcul in thi fashion and shown in fig 1 is qualit the same as the
canon heat capac see i the melt peak in the microcanon heat capac occur
at the same calcuat temperatur as the temperatur of the melt peak in the canon heat capac and there are slope chang region at temperatur that correspond to
equilibrium between the icosahedr basin and the truncat octahedr global minimum
structur the present simul are also use to obtain structur insight about the cluster as a function of total energi we have calcul the order paramet q4 as defin
in i as a function of temperatur and compar the classif into the three categori
of isom truncat octahedr icosahedr or liquidlik use the energi criterion also
outlin in i
in fig 2 we show the calor curv t e determin from our parallel temper microcanon mc simul we also present the canon curv for comparison the
melt transit near t 0166kb is reflect in the chang in slope of the temperatur
as a function of the energi the microcanon curv doe not display a van der waal
loop and remain veri close to the canon curv the averag valu of the order paramet q4 is display in the lower panel of fig 2 as a function of the total energi as
ha been discuss in i for the canon simul the order paramet begin to drop at
energi where there is the onset of isomer transit to the icosahedr basin near
e 160 and the order paramet reach it lowest valu at the melt transit
the isom distribut have been evalu either use the paramet q4 or use the
energi criterion see the discuss in paper i the result have been plot in fig 3
as a function of the total energi the behavior of the isom distribut as a function
of energi is similar to the canon distribut as a function of temperatur and the
cluster exhibit equilibrium between truncat octahedr and icosahedr geometri in the
e 150 prior to the solidlik to liquidlik phase chang as in
energi rang 160
the canon case the icosahedr distribut is a symmetr function of the energi when
the energi criterion is use rather than the definit base on q4 thi differ reflect
the differ between the two definit of icosahedr and liquid basin the oscillatori
structur observ at the peak of pq4 for the icosahedr distribut in the upper panel of
fig 3 is smaller than the calcul error two standard deviat of the mean are shown
whether the observ structur would persist for a longer simul is not known to us
becaus the definit that assign configur to the icosahedr basin is arbitrari we
have chosen not to investig thi structur further
it is use to contrast the current result with previou constant energi studi of lj38
previou simul have use molecular dynam method where no attempt ha been
made to insur ergod to contrast these past studi with the molecular dynam techniqu discuss in the next section of thi paper we defin standard molecular dynam to
repres the usual molecular dynam method where no special procedur is introduc
to insur ergod simul of lj38 use standard molecular dynam invari lead
to a calor curv with a clear van der waal loop and a melt temperatur higher than
that infer from fig 229 from the result of ref 29 the cluster is trap in the octahedr basin and the system doe reflect the true dynam coexist state between the
truncat octahedron and the icosahedr basin thi is the common situat encount
in md simul of the lj38 system the cluster choos either to remain trap in the
octahedr basin or to escap and coexist between the icosahedr solidlik and liquidlik
form becaus the system is unabl to return from the octahedr basin the microcanon
temperatur decreas in the usual case van der waal loop aris when there are larg
energi gap between the lowestenergi isomers30 in the specif case of lj38 it appear that
the presenc of extra icosahedr isom onli slightli higher in energi than the octahedr
structur elimin thi loop in the ergod microcanon calor curv
in order to extract dynam quantiti the mont carlo method we have present
must be modifi to sampl the md ensembl the modif is the subject of the next
section
iii ergod molecular dynam
the molecular dynam ensembl differ from the microcanon ensembl in that two
quantiti are conserv in addit to the total energi e volum v and number of particl
n these two quantiti are the total linear momentum p and total angular momentum
l if their valu are prescrib the densiti of state remain the fundament quantiti of

as is the case in the microcanon ensembl see eq2 for atom system the momentum

as in the microcanon ensembl we defin the entropi in the molecular dynam ensembl by s kb ln the differ between the microcanon and molecular dynam
ensembl are the expon 3n2 which is reduc by 3 owe to the geometr constraint the potenti energi which now includ the contribut of the centrifug energi
and the weight 1 det i which is a consequ of the conserv of the angular momentum mont carlo simul can sampl the md ensembl by perform a random walk

provid that all quantiti insid bracket are posit otherwis the move is reject it
is remark that the geometr weight have cancel in thi express
the mont carlo method we have just describ allow sampl of configur space
rigor equival to the sampl we would obtain use molecular dynam but with
the addit possibl of cross the energi barrier higher than the avail energi
the method can be use in it present form to extract equilibrium properti onli depend
on the energi or geometri as ha been illustr in the previou section to comput dynam quantiti the method can also provid a databas of configur repres
of a given total energi instead of perform a few veri long md simul that are in
principl unabl to reach other part of the energi surfac separ by barrier higher than
the avail energi we choos to perform a statist number of short simul start
from configur obtain by parallel temper mont carlo in the md ensembl with
same total energi and angular momentum by construct if the mc method is correctli
ergod then the hybrid md method we have suggest can be expect to yield ergod

we now illustr thi ergod molecular dynam method on the lj38 problem two

where the averag is taken over all particl of the system and over all short md simul

we write the equat describ the hamiltonian dynam in condens form as t

diverg the success length are accumul and contribut to the averag valu of
in i the cluster have been defin use a hard sphere constrain potenti becaus
the angular momentum is not conserv after reflect from such hard wall boundari in
the molecular dynam simul we have chosen a soft repuls spheric wall uc defin

in thi equat the atom distanc r are measur with respect to the cluster center
of mass the simul have been perform set the angular momentum to zero for
simplic we stress that even in thi case with l 0 the weight 1 det i must be
includ in the mont carlo probabl so that we effect sampl the md ensembl
the actual thermodynam behavior in the md ensembl at zero angular momentum is
nevertheless nearli ident to the microcanon behavior
the applic to the lj38 cluster ha been made by perform 1010 mc step follow
107 equilibr step in a parallel temper simul in the md ensembl the same
40 total energi have been chosen as in the previou section and 105 configur have
been store everi 105 step for each simul short molecular dynam run of 104 time
step follow 103 equilibr step have been perform for each of these configur
with the same total energi as the correspond mc trajectori of origin and with zero
total linear and angular momenta as well the paramet use for the constrain wall
are respect rc 225 and 100 for both the mc and md run a simpl verlet
algorithm ha been use to propag the md trajectori with the time step t 001
reduc lj unit the propag of the tangent trajectori to calcul the lyapunov
expon ha been determin with a fourth order rungekutta scheme the final valu of
d and are an averag over the 105 md simul the variat of d and with total
energi are depict in fig 4 in both case two curv have been plot calcul either
from standard molecular dynam with 108 time step follow 107 equilibr step
and start initi from the lowestenergi structur or from our hybrid ergod molecular
dynam method for both quantiti the two md scheme clearli yield distinct valu in
the energi rang where equilibrium between truncat octahedr and icosahedr geometri
occur the thermodynam temperatur not plot here ha the same variat as the
calor curv of fig 2 when calcul with ergod md standard molecular dynam
predict a van der waal loop center at t 018kb for standard md the cluster is
trap in the icosahedr basin and is in practic unabl to reach the octahedr basin
onli the equilibrium between the icosahedr basin and liquidlik structur occur as
can be seen from the upper panel of fig 4 thi chang in curvatur of the temperatur is
also present for the diffus constant which exhibit strong variat at the energi where
the octahedr structur vanish when standard md is use in contrast the variat in
ergod md are smooth
the melt temperatur impli by the largest lyapunov expon is also higher in
standard md than in ergod md even though the variat of the lyapunov expon are
continu in both md schemes29 inde use ergod molecular dynam we observ a
shift of the curv obtain by standard md toward the lower energi as shown by hind
berri and wales3537 the lyapunov expon and the kolmogorov entropi are quantiti
essenti depend on the local properti of the energi landscap one contribut
come from the neg curvatur of the landscap and anoth contribut is the fluctuat of posit curvature38 both contribut are affect by the cluster be trap
either insid the truncat octahedr basin or insid the icosahedr basin in thi latter
case in particular the differ isom belong to the icosahedr basin are connect
through region of neg curvatur while onli one isom defin the octahedr funnel
becaus ergod molecular dynam allow the cluster to be found in both basin prior
to melt the dynam behavior is like to be veri differ and more chaotic with
respect to the dynam behavior of the cluster confin to the octahedr funnel thi
differ is precis what we observ on the lower panel of fig 4
iv conclus
in thi paper we have explor the parallel temper method in simul in the
microcanon ensembl the implement of the parallel temper algorithm in thi
ensembl is straightforward the boltzmann factor expu be replac by the microcanon weight e u3n21 applic to the lj38 cluster ha shown the thermodynam behavior in the microcanon ensembl to be similar to the behavior in the canon
ensembl the solidliquid phase chang is preced by a solidsolid phase chang where the
cluster is in equilibrium between truncat octahedr and icosahedr geometri thi
phase equilibrium is well reproduc in the simul owe to the power of parallel temper the calcul microcanon calor curv which doe not display a van der waal
loop is consist with the singl peak heat capac observ in i16
we have extend the parallel temper microcanon mont carlo algorithm to sampl the molecular dynam ensembl at constant total energi linear momentum and angular
momentum combin with standard molecular dynam thi method circumv the lack
of connect between region of the potenti energi surfac the method can ensur ergod in microcanon simul which is much more difficult to achiev than in the
canon ensembl iron thi ergod md method can be view as the counterpart
of the techniqu develop by chekmarev and krivov to studi the dynam of system
confin to onli one catchment basin in the energi surface39
we have perform a statist number of short molecular dynam run start from
configur store period in parallel temper mont carlo simul these simul sampl the md ensembl at the same total energi linear and angular momenta
as the standard molecular dynam run in fact the length of the md run is mainli
dictat by the larg number of start configur one may think of reduc drastic thi number to allow for the calcul of paramet vari on longer time scale
unfortun if the energi landscap is not known in advanc then it is hard to guess how
import are the contribut of the basin not select as start configur in the
case of lj38 have onli 3 main region on the energi surfac one possibl is to comput
a dynam properti as the averag valu over 3 differ simul start either from
the truncat octahedr geometri one icosahedr geometri or a lowli liquid geometri
all carri out at the same total energi howev as we have seen in fig 3 it is not obviou
how to choos properli the weight of each basin in thi averag becaus of the difficulti
in distinguish between icosahedr and liquid structur in mani case for thi reason
we believ that the first parallel temper mc step of the hybrid ergod method is essenti in the vicin of phase chang to captur mani start configur that are use
subsequ in standard molecular dynam the enhanc sampl offer by parallel
temper can also act as a statist represent of the energi surfac at a given total
energi and the long time dynam may be further investig by use master equat
after search the saddl points1540
we have calcul two dynam quantiti with the present hybrid mdmc method
the diffus constant and the largest lyapunov expon in the 38atom lennardjon
cluster the variat of both quantiti with the total energi are significantli differ
when evalu with standard nonergod molecular dynam or with our hybrid ergod
md method these result emphas the differ contribut of the two funnel of the
energi landscap to the averag valu of the paramet estim
the algorithm develop in thi investig allow the calcul of thermodynam
structur or dynam properti of system such as lj38 that can be express as phase
space or time averag parallel temper work use a criterion base on the potenti
energi but not on the geometri consequ permut isom can be introduc
in the cours of the simul quantiti such as fluctuat of configurationdepend
properti are much more difficult to extract than actual averag for instanc the lindemann index which measur the root mean squar bond length fluctuat is often
consid to be a reliabl paramet for detect melt in atom and molecular system thi quantiti cannot be properli estim with the ergod md scheme and the
same difficulti persist for other method base on the use of differ trajectori
although the idea of combin mont carlo sampl with standard molecular dynam
can be appli to other techniqu such as jumpwalk we believ that parallel temper
is the key to the success in the case of lj38 as in the canon version the equilibrium
phase between truncat octahedr and icosahedr structur is correctli reproduc in
an energi rang preced the melt region becaus in thi rang configur may be
access either from higher energi trajectori contain mainli icosahedr geometri
or from lower energi trajectori act as a reservoir for the octahedr geometri as
notic by falcioni and deem25 the parallel temper algorithm is especi use at low
temperatur or in our case at low energi the long relax time inher in system
like cluster protein critic or glassi liquid are a seriou difficulti for standard simul
method we expect the present ergod method to be particularli use to deal with the
dynam of such system
the method we have present work at constant total energi it is possibl to improv
ergod in constanttemperatur md either by use canon parallel temper as in
the work of sugita and okamoto41 or by coupl parallel temper canon mont carlo
to short nosehoov trajectori in the nosehoov approach such molecular dynam
simul do conserv a zero angular momentum so a rigor mc sampl should in
clude the geometr weight 1 det i in the probabl also in thi case the present
microcanon scheme can be easili use for rotat bodi which make the method suitabl for investig the strong influenc of centrifug effect on phase chang in atom

fig 1 the heat capac as a function of energi calcul in the microcanon ensembl
the melt peak occur at the same calcul temperatur in the microcanon ensembl as
found in the canon ensembl but the height of the microcanon peak is significantli higher
than the canon peak compar with fig 1 in i both the microcanon and canon heat
capac display a region of chang in slope at the transit between the truncat octahedron
and the icosahedr basin the error bar repres two standard deviat of the mean
fig 2 upper panel the microcanon calor curv for lj38 obtain from parallel temper mont carlo simul the temperatur is plot as a function of the total energi both
express in reduc lj unit the circl are the direct result of microcanon simul the
solid line is a fit obtain by the histogram reweight techniqu also plot as a dot line is
the calor curv in the canon ensembl lower panel averag valu of the order paramet q4
as a funciton of the total energi for both panel the error bar are smaller than the size of the

fig 3 upper panel the probabl distribut of the order paramet q4 as a function of
the total energi lower panel the probabl distribut of the energi of the quench structur
as a function of the total energi for both quantiti fcc label the truncat octahedron ic
label structur from the icosahedr basin and liq label structur from the liquid region in
the lower panel the error bar are smaller than the size of the symbol in the upper panel the
error bar repres two standard deviat of the mean
fig 4 two dynam paramet calcul for lj38 use either standard molecular dynam start from the lowestenergi structur empti symbol or the hybrid ergod mdmc
method full symbol as a function of the total energi the result are express in lennardjon
