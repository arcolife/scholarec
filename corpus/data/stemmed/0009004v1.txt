modular invari 2d conform qft and subfactor
one of the great excit in conform qft wa the ade classif of modular
invari coupl matric for the su2 current algebra 5 at each level k thi algebra
ha onli a finit number of covari represent with posit energi superselect
sector and the partit function for the conform hamiltonian in these sector span a
linear represent of the modular group sl2 z act on the temperatur paramet
a modular invari is a quadrat form describ by the coupl matrix z in thi space
of partit function which is invari under the modular group and which is subject
to a number of addit constraint these constraint are necessari for the modular
invari be interpret as the partit function of a local 2d conform qft with
a uniqu vacuum vector thi 2d conform qft contain the su2 current algebra
both as left and right chiral subalgebra
the fact that su2 modular invari can be classifi accord to an ade scheme
ha rais the interest of mathematician both for it arithmet appeal and for it relationship to sever other classif problem for an overview see 27 as a physicist

i want to focu on the quantum field theoret aspect of thi classif problem i
also want to consid it from a broader perspect name as a statement about the
possibl posit of the embed of two left and right chiral subtheori al and ar
into a local 2d conform quantum field theori b the case of su2 is then just a veri
special one and an exact ade classif cannot be expect to prevail in gener
from thi perspect the classif problem is to find all local 2d conform
qft which extend the given chiral subtheori al and ar these extens are also
though not complet character by a coupl matrix z the nontrivi requir
here which impos constraint on z is local while modular invari is a secondari
featur
final there is a third aspect of modular invari which is of interest for the classif of subfactor the embed of chiral subtheori into a local 2d conform
qft give rise to local subfactor of the form ac b which are call canon tensor
product subfactor 22 the specif mean of canon will be explain below and
is again relat to the exist of a coupl matrix such subfactor also aris eg
as gener quantum doubl or as asymptot subfactor a gener classif is
not avail but sever result on canon tensor product subfactor will be report
which have direct implic with regard to the modular and local qft classif
problem
i emphas that in the local perspect modular invari is an addit requir which is often impos on the 2d conform qft by string theori demand in
fact it is not independ from the requir of local sever result below show
that 2d local almost impli modular invari but not quit sinc there are easi
exampl of local 2d extens with a coupl matrix which is not modular invari
on the other hand among the modular invari coupl matric for affin lie algebra
of higher rank there are some accident one which do not come from ani local 2d
conform qft eg 25
in order to further clarifi the relat between local and modular invari we
recal the notion of statist charact introduc in 20 which directli deriv from
local it provid a pair of matric x and y defin in term of the statist of a system
of superselect sector sect 3 x is the diagon matrix of the statist phase while
y collect the valu of the rel monodromi oper in a natur tracial state
unless there is some degeneraci in the statist these matric yield anoth unitari
represent of the modular group sl2 z statist represent prop 33 a
priori thi represent is not relat to modular transform of the temperatur
paramet of the partit function for these sector note also that partit function
need not even exist a priori as gibb function but at least for affin lie algebra and
certain relat algebra both represent of the modular group exist and coincid
the counter exampl mention abov local 2d conform qft but not modular
invari are due to the possibl noncoincid of the two represent in mani
case even if thermodynam modular invari fail the analog invari properti
with respect to the matric x and y still hold true i propos to call thi invari
properti degener or nondegener statist symmetri def 34 nondegener

kh rehren local and modular invari
statist symmetri is equival to modular invari with respect to the statist
represent prop 35 use criteria for statist symmetri will be provid eg
the maxim chiral observ within the 2d theori alway have it but there are also
exampl of local 2d theori which satisfi not even statist symmetri cf sect 3
i shall not discuss the character of solut to the variou classif problem in term of graph such as ade further detail on thi aspect can be found in

the modular invari perspect
one consid a ration chiral qft a and the finit system of it covari represent
i with posit energi the most promin exampl for a are affin lie algebra
current algebra the virasoro algebra with central charg c 1 or certain w algebra
aris in coset construct one assum that the charact i for each of these
represent exist as gibb function ie exp i l0 are trace class oper
and that the charact transform linearli in a unitari represent of the sl2 z
transform of the complex temperatur paramet i2 in the regim im 0
and further paramet if necessari thi assumpt is fulfil for all the exampl

the unitari matrix repres for the gener transform 1

the modular classif problem find all coupl matric z with nonneg integ entri and z00 1 which commut with the given pair of matric s and
t and find out and discard the accident one which do not correspond to a local 2d
theori see abov

one find sever type of solut which come in pair becaus with z also zc cz
is a solut there is alway the diagon solut z

where the extend charact i i nii i unit certain famili i of sector and
is some permut of the famili among these there are the orbifold solut where
sector i and j belong to the same famili if and onli if they differ by a simpl sector with
respect to fusion belong to some group of simpl sector solut with the ident
permut are call type i those with a nontrivi permut are call type ii
for the su2 affin lie algebra it turn out that for all modular invari the
nonvanish diagon entri zii 0 can be identifi with the coxet expon of a
dynkin diagram of type a d or e 5 the an diagram correspond to the diagon type i
invari dodd to permut and deven to orbifold invari respect e6 and e8
correspond to the except type i and e7 to the except type ii invari these
ade invari exhaust all modular invari for su2 there are similar classif
for su3 but an exact match with dynkin diagram cannot be achiev 8

the local qft perspect
we consid
the local classif problem find all local 2d conform qft which irreduc extend the given pair of chiral theori a al ar

21
to formal the problem i adopt the algebra framework of qft thu a qft

interv or bo with o a 2d doublecon subject to standard axiom includ essenti
haag dualiti an inclus like 21 is thu alway understood as the collect of local
subfactor al i ar j bo for all o i j
there is no a priori reason from the local qft perspect whi the left and right
chiral subtheori al and ar of a 2d conform qft b should be isomorph pariti
symmetr i prefer to includ the heterot nonsymmetr case in my discuss
from the begin
the left and right chiral observ within the 2d conform theori b must commut
with the respect opposit mobiu group it ha been shown 21 that all 2d observ
which are invari under the right mobiu group inde defin a chiral subtheori refer to as the maxim left chiral observ amax

anticip result below one find that the maxim chiral observ coincid
with the extend observ in the modular invari context 16 with respect to
which the coupl matrix turn into a permut matrix thu give rise to the block
form 14 thi fact is due in view of prop 41 below to the follow equival
character of the maxim chiral observ 21

the subalgebra of left and right chiral observ form an algebra tensor product
and at least in the cyclic subspac of the vacuum they are also repres as a tensor
product 21 it is expect that the tensor product is spatial in the full represent of
the 2d theori and we shall assum thi in the sequel
thi mean that the vacuum represent of b as a represent of the subalgebra
al ar decompos into irreduc accord to the scheme

the coupl matrix z appear in thi decomposit serv as a first though not
complet character of the extens again z ha nonneg integ entri
and z00 1 becaus of the uniqu of the vacuum vector but the label i and j may
run over differ set the sector of al and of ar and z may be rectangular although
a priori the direct sum might be countabl or even uncount infinit we shall assum
it to be finit throughout
it follow that the thermodynam partit function of the 2d conform qft if
it exist is of the most gener form in term of chiral gibb function

with the same coupl matrix z as in the decomposit 24 the notion of coupl matrix thu coincid in the modular and in the local interpret i emphas
howev that coupl matric associ with local 2d extens are not necessarili

due to the intermedi inclus 22 the coupl matrix is a product

bii i play a role like the famili of sector in eq
14 thi analog will also be exhibit in sect 3
the question aris by which data of the chiral subtheori apart from the coupl
matrix their local 2d extens can be character it should be stress that the
coupl matrix will in gener not determin the local extens up to equival although it happen to do so in model with few sector an answer ha been given in
14 for the more gener problem of character local extens b of a qft a in ani
dimens
the local extens b of a quantum field theori a is character by it canon
dhr tripl w w1 assum the index of the local subfactor ao bo to
be finit 14 here is the dhr endomorph 6 of a which describ the vacuum

the sector of describ the dhr charg 6 with respect to the subtheori a which
appear in the vacuum represent of b the isometri w singl out the vacuum
charg zero sector within and w1 is a gener function for the collect of
3jsymbol amplitud of 3point function of charg carri field the ident
27 reflect the condit that the correspond linear combin of local vertex

28 express the condit that these combin which constitut the field of b

the extens b is recov from the canon dhr tripl as follow 14 if is

transport for the local qsystem 0 w w1 can be move to everi poincar or

we conclud that local extens of local qft are complet character by
canon dhr tripl that is solut w w1 to 27 and 28 within the categori of
dhr endomorph and their intertwin for ration qft these oper ident
constitut a finit system of nonlinear algebra equat which may serv as the basi
of the present classif problem

it specif is equival to the specif of the coupl matrix thu the local

the local classif problem involv the determin of all admiss coupl
matric as wa mention befor and will be discuss in more detail in the next section
these do not coincid with the modular invari coupl matric nevertheless the
question aris whether for ani given modular invari an associ local 2d conform
qft exist and whether thi will be uniqu we therefor address also
the exist and uniqu problem for local 2d conform qft decid
whether a given coupl matrix z for al ar modular invari or not aris as the
coupl matrix of a local 2d conform qft and whether the latter is uniqu
there is no reason to expect that the uniqu problem will have a posit answer
in gener it is well known that nonisomorph subfactor can have the same canon
endomorph henc the same coupl matrix the eigenvalu condit 28 will
presum not alter the situat veri much
as for the exist problem some progress ha been made a standard solut of
27 and 28 ha been given in 14 for the coupl matrix z c pertain to the
pariti symmetr case al ar base on prop 42 below thi mean that conjug
left and right chiral dhr charg can alway be combin to yield local 2d field the
standard solut exist for ani close under fusion and conjug subsystem of dhr
sector of a and thu yield truncat conjug diagon coupl matric which are
typic not modular invari
a more gener class of possibl heterot solut can be obtain from prop 43
below for all su2 and mani other modular invari coupl matric

on the relat between modular invari and local
it is appropri to discuss the distinct between the local and the modular classif
problem
first it is not complet understood in which sens the gibb partit function of
ani chiral theori a should transform linearli under the modular group in gener when
no kacpeterson formula 11 is avail higher rank current algebra alreadi exhibit
pair of conjug sector with the same partit function and thi degeneraci ha to be
lift by introduc addit thermodynam paramet on which the modular group
can act the most gener result in thi direct is due to nahm 18 onli the subgroup
gener by t act in gener which measur the spectrum of l0 modulo integ

second one should not exclud heterot model with differ left and right chiral
observ as such model might aris upon passag to extend chiral algebra 16
even if one start with pariti symmetr model the left and right chiral algebra then
might have differ modular transform matric and the requir of modular
invari is no longer a commut properti but an intertwin properti
tl z ztr
and sl z zsr
heterot modular invari
31
if we enlarg the framework accordingli the question aris to which extent modular
invari of the coupl matrix of a local 2d extens is impli by the properti of
a canon dhr tripl
the intertwin properti for t is easili establish accord to the standard
argument all wightman field affili with the local 2d theori b must be bose field
henc should have integ differ between left and right chiral scale dimens in
the algebra framework thi follow from the eigenvalu condit
lemma 31 let w w1 be a canon dhr tripl in ani dimens and an
irreduc subsector of then ha statist phase 1
proof the statist paramet of 6

opposit chiral statist oper and the statist phase of is the quotient of the

now the chiral statist phase are relat to the chiral scale dimens h by the
spinstatist theorem 9 exp 2ih thu the matric t differ from the matric

x by an overal complex phase exp 2i 24
depend on the chiral central charg 11
it follow that the coupl matrix z intertwin tl and tr up to the quotient of these

kh rehren local and modular invari
phase thu local alway impli invari under the modular transform t up
to a phase which is trivial if the left and right central charg coincid modulo 24
a statement of compar gener cannot be obtain for the full modular group
eg the local 2d theori b al ar ha the coupl matrix zij i0 j0 which is
definit not modular invari but we can obtain nontrivi gener result concern
a symmetri which special to modular invari in favor case as thi symmetri
doe not refer to gibb function but to statist i call it statist symmetri def
34 we shall see that it is alway satisfi as a consequ of local for the maxim

thu rather than the thermodynam transform matric t and s we consid

thu we see that 2d local come close to impli the statist symmetri def
34 which gener modular invari to gener heterot model and to model

convers as mention in the introduct there are accident modular invari

the subfactor classif problem find all irreduc canon tensor product subfactor a c b with i and j in 41 belong to given system of sector
of the given factor a and c respect
we have seen in sect 2 that the left and right maxim chiral observ are each
other rel commut within the 2d theori therefor the follow gener result
formul in the broader framework of subfactor is of interest
proposit 41 21 let a c b be a ctp with dual canon endomorph as
in 41 then the follow are equival
i 1l c is the rel commut of a 1l in b and vice versa thi properti is
call normal
ii z0j 0j and zi0 i0
iii the sector i of a and the sector j of c contribut to 41 are both close
under conjug and fusion there is a biject between them which preserv the
fusion rule and the coupl matrix is the permut matrix for thi biject
it is not clear whether everi ctp a c b ha an intermedi normal ctp
a c b as in prop 41 presum thi is not the case in gener the result
in 21 on the tensor product posit of chiral observ within a 2d conform qft
howev ensur the exist of a uniqu normal intermedi subfactor correspond

the proposit when appli to canon dhr tripl thu split the local classif problem into two independ part classif of chiral local extens
a amax and classif of normal canon dhr tripl with z max an isomorph
of the fusion rule of amax
and amax

the proposit also impli that the coupl matrix 26 for a local 2d extens is
of block form 14 as for modular invari note that in the heterot case a distinct
between type i and type ii is meaningless
the ctp classif problem can again be formul algebra in term of qsystem for a c satisfi 27 with of the form 41 we cannot solv thi problem
systemat but there are systemat prescript for the construct of qsystem
for ctpss in thi way the follow prop 42 and 43 were obtain which are mainli
relev for the associ exist problem

proposit 42 14 let a be a pure infinit factor and endfin a a finit
close system of irreduc endomorph with finit index then there is a subfactor
a aopp b with dual canon endomorph

42
if the system is braid then the eigenvalu condit 28 is also satisfi
the result ha been gener to factor of type ii and to infinit system by
masuda 15 who also show that the result subfactor is isomorph to the asymptot
subfactor associ with the inclus a a where is the direct sum of all
i izumi ha shown how to comput the complet structur of these subfactor 10
the coupl matrix in prop 42 is the diagon unit matrix for the system in chiral
conform qft on the circl aopp aiopp is natur isomorph to ai ai
and the latter is mobiu conjug to ai a under these identif the opposit
opp of a dhr endomorph belong to the charg conjug sector

appli to the exist problem for a given coupl matrix or modular invari
the proposit thu state that the conjug diagon matrix z c alway correspond
to a local 2d theori by choos irreduc subfactor a a 1 2 one obtain
an abund of ctpss a1 aopp

restrict of enddhr a to a
the follow result is an import gener by which local 2d conform qft
can be associ with numer other also type ii modular invari

endfin a two finit close system of inequival irreduc endomorph for a
pair of induct see below of put

intertwin for product of i as well ie hom1 2 3 a hom1 2 3 m
if furthermor the system are braid and the braid fulfil a natur condit with respect to hom m then the ctp also satifi the eigenvalu condit

let a1 a2 be local algebra of chiral observ 1 2 subsystem of their dhr
endomorph and assum that the dual canon endomorph for the subfactor
a m are also dhr endomorph these subfactor need not describ local chiral
extens then induct cf sect 3 is applic to and the assumpt of
prop 43 are fulfil with the two opposit prescript for induct it wa shown
in 4 that the correspond coupl matrix 43 ha statist symmetri in fact
mani thermodynam modular invari can be obtain thi way for these modular
invari prop 43 thu prove the exist of an associ local 2d conform qft
the statement of prop 43 is howev not restrict to induct and therefor
produc a larger class of ctpss than appear in 2d conform qft on the other
hand uniqu of the subfactor in prop 42 and 43 is not claim there may well be
inequival ctpss with the same dual canon endomorph but with inequival
qsystem
conclus
i have discuss the interrel between sever classif problem aris in mathemat and physic with variou applic and interpret modular invari
local 2d conform qft and canon tensor product subfactor they all have some
aspect in common notabl a coupl matrix but the specif requir impos
on the coupl matrix depend on the perspect progress in ani of these classif
problem will have a bear on the relat one
