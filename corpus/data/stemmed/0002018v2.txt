modern mathemat physic
what it should be

februari 4 2008
when somebodi ask me what i do in scienc i call myself a specialist in
mathemat physic as i have been there for more than 40 year i have some
definit interpret of thi combin of word mathemat physic
cynic or purist can insist that thi is neither mathemat nor physic ad
comment with a differ degre of malic natur thi call for an answer
and in thi short essay i want to explain briefli my understand of the subject
it can be consid as my contribut to the discuss about the origin and
role of mathemat physic and thu to be relev for thi volum
the matter is complic by the fact that the term mathemat physic
often abbrevi by mp in what follow is use in differ sens and can
have rather differ content thi content chang with time place and person
i did not studi properli the histori of scienc howev it is my impress
that in the begin of the twentieth centuri the term mp wa practic
equival to the concept of theoret physic not onli henri poincar but
also albert einstein were call mathemat physicist newli establish
theoret chair were call chair of mathemat physic it follow from
the document in the archiv of the nobel committe that mp had a right to
appear both in the nomin and discuss of the candid for the nobel
prize in physic 1 roughli speak the concept of mp cover theoret
paper where mathemat formula were use
howev dure an unpreced bloom of theoret physic in the 20
and 30 an essenti separ of the term theoret and mathemat
occur for mani peopl mp wa reduc to the import but auxiliari
cours method of mathemat physic includ a set of use mathemat tool the monograph of p mors and h feshbach 2 is a classic exampl
of such a cours address to a wide circl of physicist and engin
on the other hand mp in the mathemat interpret appear as a
theori of partial differenti equat and variat calculu the monograph of r courant and d hilbert 3 and s sobolev 4 are outstand
illustr of thi develop the theorem of exist and uniqu
base on the variat principl a priori estim and imbed theorem
for function space compris the main content of thi direct as a student
of o ladyzhenskaya i wa immers in thi subject sinc the 3rd year of my
1
undergradu studi at the physic depart of leningrad univers my
fellow student n uraltseva now hold the chair of mp exactli in thi sens
mp in thi context ha as it sourc mainli geometri and such part of
classic mechan as hydrodynam and elast theori sinc the 60 a
new impetu to mp in thi sens wa suppli by quantum theori here the
main apparatu is function analysi includ the spectral theori of oper
in hilbert space the mathemat theori of scatter and the theori of lie
group and their represent the main subject is the schroding oper
though the method and concret content of thi part of mp are essenti
differ from those of it classic counterpart the methodolog attitud is
the same one see the quest for the rigor mathemat theorem about
result which are understood by physicist in their own way
i wa born as a scientist exactli in thi environ i graduat from
the uniqu chair of mathemat physic establish by vi smirnov at the
physic depart of leningrad univers alreadi in the 30 in hi ventur
vi smirnov got support from v fock the world famou theoret physicist
with veri wide mathemat interest origin thi chair play the auxiliari role of be respons for the mathemat cours for physic student
howev in 1955 it got permiss to supervis it own diploma project and
i belong to the veri first group of student use thi opportun as i alreadi mention oa ladyzhenskaya wa our main professor although her
own interest were mostli in nonlinear pde and hydrodynam she decid to
direct me to quantum theori dure last two year of undergradu studi i
wa to read the monograph of ko friedrich mathemat aspect of quantum field theori and relat it to our group of 5 student and our professor
on a special seminar at the same time my student friend from the chair of
theoret physic were absorb in read the first monograph on quantum
electrodynam by a ahies and v berestevski the differ in attitud
and languag wa strike and i wa to becom accustom to both
after my graduat oa ladyzhenskaya remain my tutor but she left
me free to choos research topic and literatur to read i read both mathemat paper ie on direct and invers scatter problem by im gelfand
and bm levitan va marchenko mg krein aya povzner and physic review ie on formal scatter theori by m gellmann m goldberg
j schwinger and h ekstein as well paper by i segal l vanhov and
r haag ad to my first impress on quantum field theori taken from
k friederich in the process of thi selfeduc my own understand of
the natur and goal of mp gradual deviat from the prevail view of the
member of the v smirnov chair i decid that it is more challeng to do
someth which is not known to my colleagu from theoret physic rather
than suppli theorem of substanti my first work on the invers scatter
problem especi for the manydimension schroding oper and that on
the three bodi scatter problem confirm that i realli tri to follow thi line
of thought
thi attitud becam even firmer when i began to work on quantum field
theori in the middl of the 60 as a result my understand of the goal of mp
2
drastic modifi i consid as the main goal of mp the use of mathemat
intuit for the deriv of realli new result in the fundament physic
in thi sens mp and theoret physic are competitor their goal in
unravel the law of the structur of matter coincid howev the method
and even the estim of the import of the result of work may differ quit
signif
here it is time to say in what sens i use the term fundament physic the
adject fundament ha mani possibl interpret when appli to the
classif of scienc in a wider sens it is use to character the research
direct to unravel new properti of physic system in the narrow sens
it is kept onli for the search for the basic law that govern and explain these
properti
thu all chemic properti can be deriv from the schroding equat
for a system of electron and nuclei altern we can say that the fundament law of chemistri in a narrow sens are alreadi known thi of cours
doe not depriv chemistri of the right to be call a fundament scienc in a
wide sens
the same can be said about classic mechan and the quantum physic of
condens matter wherea the largest part of physic research lie now in the
latter it is clear that all it success includ the theori of superconduct
and superfluid boseeinstein condens and quantum hall effect have a
fundament explan in the nonrelativist quantum theori of mani bodi
system
an unfinish physic fundament problem in a narrow sens is physic of
elementari particl thi put thi part of physic into a special posit and
it is here where modern mp ha the most probabl chanc for a breakthrough
inde until recent time all physic develop along the tradit circl
experi theoret interpret new experi so the theori tradit follow the experi thi impos a sever censorship on the
theoret work ani idea bright as it is which is not suppli by the experiment knowledg at the time when it appear is to be consid wrong
and as such must be abandon characterist the role of censor might be
play by theoretician themselv and the great l landau and w pauli were
as far as i can judg the most sever one and of cours they had veri good
reason
on the other hand the develop of mathemat which is also to a great
extent influenc by applic ha nevertheless it intern logic idea are
judg not by their relev but more by esthet criteria the totalitarian
of theoret physic give way to a kind of democraci in mathemat and it
inher intuit and exactli thi freedom could be found use for particl
physic thi part of physic tradit is base on the progress of acceler
techniqu the veri high cost and restrict possibl of the latter soon will
becom an uncircumvent obstacl to further develop and it is here
that mathemat intuit could give an adequ altern thi wa alreadi stress by famou theoretician with mathemat inclin inde
let me cite a paper 5 by p dirac from the earli 30
3
the steadi progress of physic requir for it theoret formul a mathemat that get continu more advanc thi is
onli natur and to be expect what howev wa not expect
by the scientif worker of the last centuri wa the particular form
that the line of advanc of the mathemat would take name
it wa expect that the mathemat would get more complic
but would rest on a perman basi of axiom and definit while
actual the modern physic develop have requir a mathemat that continu shift it foundat and get more abstract
noneuclidean geometri and noncommut algebra which were
at one time consid to be pure fiction of the mind and pastim for logic thinker have now been found to be veri necessari
for the descript of gener fact of the physic world it seem
like that thi process of increas abstract will continu in the
futur and that advanc in physic is to be associ with a continu modif and gener of the axiom at the base of
mathemat rather than with logic develop of ani one mathemat scheme on a fix foundat
there are at present fundament problem in theoret physic
await solut eg the relativist formul of quantum mechan and the natur of atom nuclei to be follow by more difficult one such as the problem of life the solut of which problem
will presum requir a more drastic revis of our fundament
concept than ani that have gone befor quit like these chang
will be so great that it will be beyond the power of human intellig
to get the necessari new idea by direct attempt to formul the
experiment data in mathemat term the theoret worker in
the futur will therefor have to proceed in a more inderect way the
most power method of advanc that can be suggest at present
is to employ all the resourc of pure mathemat in attempt to
perfect and generalis the mathemat formal that form the
exist basi of theoret physic and after each success in thi
direct to tri to interpret the new mathemat featur in term
of physic entiti
similar view were express by cn yang i did not find a compact citat
but all spirit of hi commentari to hi own collect of paper 6 show thi
attitud also he use to tell thi to me in privat discuss
i believ that the dramat histori of set the gaug field as a basic tool
in the descript of interact in quantum field theori give a good illustr of the influenc of mathemat intuit on the develop of the
fundament physic gaug field or yangmil field were introduc to the
wide audienc of physicist in 1954 in a short paper by cn yang and r mill
7 dedic to the gener of the electromagnet field and the correspond principl of gaug invari the geometr sens of thi principl for
the electromagnet field wa made clear as earli as in the late 20 due to the
4
paper of v fock 8 and h weyl 9 they underlin the analog of the gaug
or gradient in the terminolog of v fock invari of the electrodynam
and the equival principl of the einstein theori of gravit the gaug
group in electrodynam is commut and correspond to the multipl
of the complex field or wave function of the electr charg particl by
a phase factor depend on the spacetim coordin einstein theori of
graviti provid an exampl of a much more sophist gaug group name
the group of gener coordin transform both h weyl and v fock were
to use the languag of the move frame with spin connect associ with
local lorentz rotat thu the lorentz group becam the first nonabelian
gaug group and one can see in 8 essenti all formula characterist of
nonabelian gaug field howev in contradistinct to the electromagnet
field the spin connect enter the descript of the spacetim and not the
intern space of electr charg
in the middl of the 30 after the discoveri of the isotop spin in nuclear
physic and form the yukawa idea of the intermedi boson o klein tri
to geometris these object hi propos wa base on hi 5dimension pictur proton and neutron as well as electron and neutrino there were no
clear distinct between strong and weak interact were put togeth in an
isovector and electromagnet field and charg vector meson compris a 2 2
matrix howev the noncommut su 2 gaug group wa not mention
klein propos wa not receiv favor and n borh did not recommend
him to publish a paper so the idea remain onli in the form of contribut
to proceed of warsaw confer new theori in physic 10
the noncommut group act in the intern space of charg appear
for the first time in the paper 7 of cn yang and r mill in 1954 there
is no wonder that yang receiv a cool reaction when he present hi work
at princeton in 1954 the dramat account of thi event can be found in hi
commentari 6 pauli wa in the audienc and immedi rais the question
about mass inde the gaug invari forbid the introduct of mass to
the vector charg field and massless lead to the long rang interact
which contradict the experi the onli known massless particl and
accompan long rang interact are photon and graviton it is evid
from yang text that pauli wa well acquaint with the differenti geometri
of nonabelian vector field but hi own censorship did not allow him to speak
about them as we know now the bold of yang and hi esthet feel
final were vindic and it can be rightli said that cn yang proceed
accord to mathemat intuit
in 1954 the paper of yang and mill did not move to the forefront of high
energi theoret physic howev the idea of the charg space with noncommut symmetri group acquir more and more popular due to the increas number of elementari particl and the search for the univers scheme
of their classif and at that time the decis role in the promot of
the yangmil field wa also play by mathemat intuit
at the begin of the 60 r feynman work on the extens of hi own
scheme of quantiz of the electromagnet field to the gravit theori of
5
einstein a pure technic difficulti the abund of the tensor indic
made hi work rather slow follow the advic of m gellmann he exercis
first on the simpler case of the yangmil field to hi surpris he found that
a naiv gener of hi diagrammat rule design for electrodynam
did not work for the yangmil field the unitar of the smatrix wa broken
feynman restor the unitar in one loop by reconstruct the full scatter
amplitud from it imaginari part and found that the result can be interpret
as a subtract of the contribut of some fictiti particl howev hi techniqu becam quit cumbersom beyond one loop hi approach wa gradual
develop by b dewitt 11 it must be stress that the physic senseless
of the yangmil field did not preclud feynman from use it for mathemat
construct
the work of feynman 12 becam one of the start point for my work in
quantum field theori which i began in the middl of the 60 togeth with
victor popov anoth point as import wa the mathemat monograph by
a lichnerowitz 13 dedic to the theori of connect in vector bundl
from lichnerowitz book it follow clearli that the yangmil field ha a
definit geometr interpret it defin a connect in the vector bundl
the base be the spacetim and the fiber the linear space of the represent
of the compact group of charg thu the yangmil field find it natur
place among the field of geometr origin between the electromagnet field
which is it particular exampl for the onedimension charg and einstein
gravit field which deal with the tangent bundl of the riemannian spacetim manifold
it becam clear to me that such a possibl cannot be miss and notwithstand the unsolv problem of zero mass one must activ tackl the problem of the correct quantiz of the yangmil field
the geometr origin of the yangmil field gave a natur way to resolv the
difficulti with the diagrammat rule the formul of the quantum theori
in term of feynman function integr happen to be most appropri from
the technic point of view inde to take into account the gaug equival
principl one ha to integr over the class of gaug equival field rather
than over everi individu configur as soon as thi idea is understood the
technic realiz is rather straightforward as a result v popov and i came
out at the end of 1966 with a set of rule valid for all order of perturb
theori the fictiti particl appear as auxiliari variabl give the integr
represent for the nontrivi determin enter the measur over the set
of gaug orbit
correct diagrammat rule of quantiz of the yangmil field obtain
by v popov and me in 19661967 14 15 did not attract immedi the attent of physicist moreov the time when our work wa done wa not
favor for it quantum field theori wa virtual forbidden especi in
the soviet union due to the influenc of landau the hamiltonian is dead
thi phrase from hi paper 16 dedic to the anniversari of w pauli
show the extrem of landau attitud the reason wa quit solid it wa
base not on experi but on the investig of the effect of renormal6
izat which led landau and hi cowork to believ that the renorm
physic coupl constant is inevit zero for all possibl local interact
so there wa no way for victor popov and me to publish an extend articl
in a major soviet journal we opt for the short commun in physic
letter and were happi to be abl to publish the full version in the preprint
seri of newli open kiev institut of theoret physic thi preprint wa
final translat into english by b lee as a fermilab preprint in 1972 and
from the prefac to the translat it follow that it wa known in the west
alreadi in 1968
a decis role in the success promot of our diagrammat rule into
physic wa play by the work of g t hooft 17 dedic to the yang
mill field interact with the higg field and which ultim led to a nobel
prize for him in 1999 and the discoveri of dimension transmut the
term of s coleman 18 the problem of mass wa solv in the first case
via the spontan symmetri break the second develop wa base
on asymptot freedom there exist a vast literatur dedic to the histori
of thi dramat develop i refer to the recent paper of g t hooft 19
and d gross 20 where the particip in thi stori share their impress
of thi progress as a result the standard model of unifi interact got it
main technic tool from the middl of the 70 until our time it remain the
fundament base of high energi physic for our discours it is import to
stress onc again that the paper 14 base on mathemat intuit preced
the work made in the tradit of theoret physic
the standard model did not complet the develop of fundament
physic in spite of it unexpect and astonish experiment success the
gravit interact whose geometr interpret is slightli differ
from that of the yangmil theori is not includ in the standard model
the unif of quantum principl lorentzeinstein rel and einstein
graviti ha not yet been accomplish we have everi reason to conjectur that
the modern mp and it mode of work will play the decis role in the quest
for such a unif
inde the new gener of theoretician in high energi physic have receiv an incompar higher mathemat educ they are not subject
to the pressur of old author maintain the puriti of physic think
andor terminolog futhermor mani profession mathematician tempt
by the beauti of the method use by physicist move to the posit of
the modern mathemat physic let use cite from the manifesto written by
p macpherson dure the organ of the quantum field theori year at
the school of mathemat of the institut for advanc studi at princeton
the goal is to creat and convey an understand in term congeni to mathematician of some fundament notion of physic
such as quantum field theori the emphasi will be on develop
the intuit stem from function integr
one way to defin the goal of the program is by negat exclud certain import subject commonli pursu by mathe7
matician whose work is motiv by physic in thi spirit it is not
plan to treat except peripher the magnifici new applic of field theori such as seibergwitten equat to donaldson
theori nor is the plan to consid fundament new construct
within mathimat that were inspir by physic such as quantum
group or vertex oper algebra nor is the aim to discuss how to
provid mathemat rigor for physic theori rather the goal is
to develop the sort of intuit common among physicist for those
who are use to thought process stem from geometri and
algebra
i propos to call the intuit to which macpherson refer that of mathemat physic i also recommend the reader to look at the instruct draw
by p dijkgraaf on the dust cover of the volum of lectur given at the school
21
the union of these two group constitut an enorm intellectu forc
in the next centuri we will learn if thi forc is capabl of substitut for the
tradit experiment base of the develop of fundament physic and
pertin physic intuit
