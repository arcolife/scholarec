abstract
an integr represent for matrix airi function is present
in memori of mv saveliev
the wellknown witten conjectur 1 that the logarithm of the partit
function of gener onematrix model can be consid as the gener
function for intersect number on the moduli space of algebra curv
wa prove by kontsevich 23 who reduc thi problem to the comput of the matrix airi function see 46 where mani aspect of thi
problem were discuss the matrix airi function is defin by an integr
represent we give anoth integr represent for thi function
follow 3 we defin the matrix airi function on the space hn of
hermitian n n matric by the integr
ax

over the space hn where dy is a u n invari measur on thi space
x y hn we also note that the function a x satisfi the equat
a x tr x ax 0

where is the laplacian
we recal that the classic airi function
ai x
exp iy 3 3 xy dy

is the uniqu solut up to a scalar factor of the differenti equat
ai x x aix 0

that is bound on real axe it follow from eq1 that the depend
and n 1 tr x where x x

of ax on the variabl x
tr x 0 can be separ inde we have

is valid for matrix airi function 1 where q and p are diagon matric

proof thi follow immedi from the harishchandra formula

theorem 2 7 if is a conjugaci invari function on the space
hermitian n n matric then

p exp i trqp v p 2 dp 9
for ani diagon hermitian matrix q where y u p u 1 and last integr
is taken over the space of diagon hermitian matric p
we thu obtain an integr represent of the matrix airi function
such that the depend on the variabl is contain onli in the standard onedimension airi function thi represent may be use for
investig of properti of the matrix airi function
for the case n 2 we have trp 3 0 and integr represent 5
take the simpler form
