primordi chemistri began at the recombin epoch when the adiabat expans caus the
temperatur of the radiat to fall below 4000k the chemistri of the earli univers involv the
element hydrogen it isotop deuterium helium with it isotop form and lithium in thi contribut i will discuss the influenc of the primordi molecul on the cosmolog decoupl
in the framework of the gravit instabl theori each protostructur start as a tini local
overdens as long as these inhomogen are small their evolut can be studi by the classic
linear perturb theori onc the deviat becom larg the linear theori is no more valid we
present the role play by these molecul on the transit between the linear regim and the nonlinear regim and show that the molecul can lead to a thermal chang at the turnaround point
between these two regim
1 introduct
at earli time the univers wa fill up with an extrem dens and hot ga due to
the expans it cool below the bind energi of hydrogen deuterium helium lithium
which led to the format of these nuclei sarkar 1996 after thi nucleosynthesi period the
recombin process is not instantan becaus the electron captur into differ atom
energi level could not cascad instantan down to the ground state atom reach the
ground state either through the cosmolog redshift of the lyman line photon or by
the 2s 1s two photon process nevertheless the univers expand and cool faster than
recombin could complet and small fraction of free electron and proton remain
the principl of calcul of the primordi recombin have been mention initi
by shklovskii 1967 novikov zeldovich 1967 peebl 1968 wa the first to present a
theori in which the veri complic recombin process is reduc to simpler term see
puy signor 2000 for the histor descript and refer therein
at the end of the recombin period it is plausibl to imagin that molecul could be
form temperatur of matter and radiat as well as the densiti are not so high and we
have possibl collision reaction between the speci howev in thi cosmolog context
we have metalfre ga which doe not allow the effici reaction of adsorpt on the surfac
of grain
the literatur on the chemistri in the postrecombin epoch ha grown consider in
the recent year mani author have develop studi of primordi chemistri in differ

galli palla 1998 and refer therein
molecul could lead to radi process through the excit of the rotat level and
contribut to the thermal evolut of the medium puy et al 1993 examin the thermal
balanc in the earli univers and show that the molecular cool and heat function have
a slight influenc on the decreas of the temperatur of the matter nevertheless molecul
could play a more decis role in the collaps of protocloud sinc molecular cool can

and to radi process absorpt from cosmic background radiat and spontan or

follow by radi transit provid that no further absorpt occur molecular heat
is due to the radi excit from cosmic microwav background follow by collision
deexcit notic that although the radi deexcit is faster than collision one

we assum that at some time in the past there were small deviat from homogen
in our univers these deviat can grow due to gravit instabl as long as these
inhomogen are small their evolut can be studi by the classic linear perturb

is no more valid it is reason to expect that region which are significantli overdens will
collaps and eventu form gravit bound object in these overdens region the
selfgrav of the local mass concentr will work against the expans of the univers
ie thi region expand at a progress slower rate compar to the background univers
such a slow down will increas the densiti contrast between the overdens region and the
background univers and consequ make the gravit potenti of the local mass
concentr more and more domin eventu such a region will collaps under it own
selfgrav and will form a bound system the detail of the abov process will depend on the
initi densiti profil the simplest model which one can studi analyt is base on the
assumpt that the overdens region is spheric symmetr
peebl 1980 describ the transit between the linear regim where the expans of
the perturb is maximum and the nonlinear regim where the perturb begin to
collaps by introduc the turnaround point

it is crucial to know the temperatur of the matter at the turnaround redshift in order to
evalu the thermal initi condit of the collaps we consid the same order of magnitud
for the mass of the fluctuat given by lahav 1986 and puy signor 1996 which
correspond to turnaround redshift in the rang 10 zta 150 which is the typic period
of the format of the first object
the evolut of turnaround temperatur is shown in fig 2 without and with the molecular
contribut the evolut of radiat temperatur is also plot we see two regim
for the two turnaround temperatur one correspond to a temperatur higher than the
radiat temperatur tr the second is rel to temperatur below tr it is import to
estim the redshift zi where the turnaround temperatur is equal to tr thi point govern the
initi behaviour of the ga if the turnaround temperatur is below the radiat temperatur
the ga heat when the ga cool when the radi temperatur is below the turnaround
temperatur thu thi condit is locat at the redshift zi 130 in the case without
molecul and zi 105 in the case with molecul anoth interest point is the point
which correspond to the turnaround redshift z 55 thi redshift correspond to a typic
valu 109 m of a collaps mass see puy signor 1997 we find see fig 2 that the turnaround temperatur tturn 70 k without molecul and tturn 100 k for the turnaround
temperatur with molecul the consequ could be import if we notic that the lower
excit temperatur for hd main thermal molecular function is 112 k close to 100 k

5 outlook
thi work show a possibl thermal modif due to the primordi molecul at the
begin of the collaps thi thermal mechan could modifi the initi condit of a
gravit collaps the follow analysi could reveal process of fragment triger
by the thermal molecular function see puy signor 1997 1998b thi last point is crucial
for the estim of the amplitud of secondari cosmic microwav background anisotropi
dubrovich 1977 1993 show that reson elast scatter must be consid as the most
effici process in coupl matter and radiat at high redshift he note that the cross
section for reson scatter between the cosmic microwav background and molecul is
sever order of magnitud larger than thomson scatter even with a modest abund
of primordi molecul let us onli emphas that again at present time the primordi
molecul abund and the reaction rate of the chemic reaction are both quit uncertain
