abstract
thi note discuss the relationship between a given intramolecular bridg assist
electron transfer rate and the correspond zero bia molecular conduct of the same
molecular speci
1 introduct
molecular electron transfer one of the most basic chemic process ha been an
activ field of research for over half a century16 investig of thi reaction on the
fundament level focu on the rate of the transfer process between donor and acceptor
speci that exist in solut either as free solut or as separ site of a bigger molecul in
addit to rate the yield of an electron transfer reaction is a meaning observ when
compet process exist theoret studi of these reaction aim to understand the
interplay between solvent dynam properti and between molecular structur and
dynam in determin these rate and yield
anoth manifest of molecular electron transfer is gain increas attent
in recent year the passag of electron current in a nanojunct compris of two metal
lead and a connect molecul or a molecular layer where the molecul ha the role of a
conduct compon see eg ref 79 thi lead to a new type of measur where
the observ is the molecular conduct ideal of a singl molecul or more gener
the currentvoltag characterist of the molecular junction on the theoret side these
observ and their depend on the molecular structur and the moleculemet

bond are usual describ use variant of the landauer formula1012 the latter is a
formal relationship between the electron transmiss coeffici associ with a given
nanostructur a properti deriv from scatter theori and it conduct the need
electron transmiss properti of the molecular junction are comput follow
methodolog appli earlier in studi of convent molecular electron transfer1314
use quantum chemic method at differ level of approxim or for discuss of
gener phenomenolog simpl model eg the superexchang model15 of the donorbridgeacceptor dba system
clearli the conduct properti of a given molecular system and the electron
transfer properti of the same system should be close relat one should keep in mind
that becaus of tunnel there is alway an ohmic regim near zero bia obvious thi
conduct may be extrem low indic in practic an insul behavior16 of
particular interest is to estim the electron transfer rate in a given donorbridgeacceptor
dba system that will translat into a measur conduct of the same system when
use as a molecular conductor between two metal lead an earlier attempt in thi direction17
wa limit to a 1dimension model and ha disregard the franckcondon factor in the
electron transfer rate in thi paper i studi thi issu and deriv an approxim practic

in eq 1 indic that the process is domin by the chang in the
nuclear configur between the two local state of the electron
suppos now that the same dba complex is use to connect between two metal
contact such that the donor and acceptor speci are chemisorb on the two metal
denot left l and right r respect in real molecular junction these speci
correspond to the end group of the molecular chain but we continu to use the term donor
and acceptor in order to maintain the analog to the correspond electron transfer process
we wish to calcul the zero bia conduct g of thi junction and it relat to k d a
first note that the conduct process doe not involv local state of the electron on the
donor or the acceptor so the factor
will not appear in g we assum that at zero bia the
metal fermi energi ef lie in the gap between the homo and lumo of the molecular
4
bridg in thi case dephas and energi loss aris from transient distort of the
bridg nuclear configur are rel small and will be disregard assum as
befor that state of the molecular complex are coupl to the metal onli via the d and a
orbit and that the latter are coupl onli to their adjac metal contact the conduct
at zero bia can be deriv from the weak coupl limit of the landauer formula or
directli from the golden rule it is given by18 g ef with

here e is the electron charg and dl and ar are width imaginari part of the
correspond self energi dl and ar of the d and a level due to their coupl to the
left and right metal lead respect
clearli a relationship between g of eq 7 and k d a of eq 5 can be establish
onli if the electron structur of the dba speci doe not chang consider upon
adsorpt on the metal lead in particular we assum that the weak coupl between the
bridg and the rest of the donor acceptor and metal system remain weak in thi case the
green function element gda is approxim relat to the bridg green function g1n

assum that thi shift occur uniformli in the dba complex without distort it intern
electron structur thi impli that x 1 x 2 1 these approxim may appear
drastic but they are suffici for order of magnitud estim as done below for exampl
sinc dl and ar are of order 1ev the error in the estim of x3 will be of order 1 and

3 discuss and conclus
the follow observ can be made first the appear of
in the
denomin of eq 12 is a direct consequ of the fact that the reorgan energi a
princip factor control molecular electron transfer rate doe not affect the
correspond conduct thi result from the import physic differ between the
two phenomena the first involv while the second doe not involv local of the
electron on the donor and acceptor speci secondli the appear of the width
paramet dl and ar in the same denomin is less obviou and may appear counterintuit it express the fact see eq 8 and recal that im 2 that the effect
coupl between the bridg and the chemisorb donor and acceptor level decreas for
increas final it may be shown by extend an argument given in ref 19 that
provid the energi space eb ef between the bridg level and the fermi energi is
larg rel to kbt eq 12 hold also when the electron transfer process involv thermal
activ into the bridg state

the paramet appear in eq 12 may be estim form experiment data or
theoret model use the classic express for

eq 3 we have for ed e a
exp 4k bt for a typic valu of the reorgan energi 05ev
and at room temperatur thi is 002ev1 take also dl ar 05ev lead to

k d a s 1
10 17 k d a s 1 1 thi set a criterion for
observ ohmic behavior for small voltag bias in molecular junction for exampl
with a current detector sensit to picoamper kda ha to exceed 106s1 for the
estim of
and given abov befor measur current can be observ at 01v
voltag across such a junction it should be kept in mind that thi estim wa done use a
valu for
base on the high temperatur approxim 3 and should modifi in
situat where
is domin by high frequenc k bt intramolecular mode
eq 12 provid a practic express for make such estim but it use should
be exercis with caution thi express is a relat between the conduct of a
molecular structur made of a bridg connect two special chemic group chemisorb
on correspond metal lead and the electron transfer rate of the same molecular structur in
solut where the same special group play the role of donor and acceptor it deriv
involv a drastic assumpt
that apart from a uniform energi shift the electron
structur of thi molecular structur when connect between the metal lead is not
consider differ from the electron structur of the correspond speci in solut
we note that most recent calcul of molecular conduct reli on similar assumpt
use as input electron structur paramet of the free molecul eg assum that the
molecular bridg is electr neutral at zero bia anoth point to emphas is that the
result 12 correspond onli to conduct at zero bia an import attribut of
experiment setup involv molecular conductor is the possibl to employ their finit
bia conduct which is not directli relat to the correspond electron transfer properti
keep these limit in mind eq 12 provid a use approxim relationship
between two extrem import molecular transport properti
