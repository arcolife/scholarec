abstract
we introduc a spectral paramet into the geometr exact hamiltonian
equat for the elast rod in a way that creat a lax pair thi assur
integr and permit applic of the invers scatter transform solut
method if the method can be carri through the solut of the origin problem
is recov by set the spectral paramet to zero
i introduct
consid a famili of curv that are bendabl and twistabl but not
shearabl or extend parametr by arc length s and time t and govern
by a set of partial differenti equat it ha been recent shown by doliwa and
santini1 that that the equat are integr provid that three condit hold
i
the curv lie on or in the surfac of an ndimension sphere
ii
the total arclength of the curv is fix and
iii
the dynam doe not depend explicitli upon the radiu of the sphere
in thi veri gener formul there is no specif physic caus for the motion
of the curv it move in ani way that might be specifi by it differenti
equat
a systemat solut procedur is suggest by these result consid a
kinemat problem in n1 dimens that is nonintegr in the sens that no
invers scatter procedur can be found that lead to it solut increas it
parametr by introduc a new independ variabl the invers of an ndimension sphere radiu plu new equat term that requir the curv to lie
on the surfac of thi sphere the expand equat are now guarante
integr and they lead to an invers scatter procedur that will integr them

if it can be carri through now let go to zero flatten the sphere surfac
back to a euclidian space of n1 dimens solut in the infinitesim
neighborhood of ani point on the sphere now becom solut to the origin
equat which may not have been integr may not have been suscept to
an invers scatter solut on their own
in thi paper we extend these power idea to the case of a curv that
move as a result of it own elast known as the elast rod in the
geometr exact hamiltonian formul the dynam behavior of the elast
rod2 is govern by four vector equat two are pure kinemat equat that
relat bend and twist to local frame rotat and shear and extens to local
frame translat the other two vector equat are dynam equat that
relat elast forc torqu and inertia term to local frame rotat and
translat we show how these equat may be treat in an expand scheme
similar to that of doliwa and santini except that constant arc length is no longer
requir the origin problem of question integr consist of twelv
scalar hamiltonian equat twelv scalar constitut equat and 24
depend variabl each one a function of s and t we use the gener
matric of the special orthogon lie rotat group so4 under which the 4dimension sphere is fulli symmetr togeth with a real spectral paramet
to construct two complex 4by4 quantiti u and v which form a lax pair in
the sens that they obey the zakharovshabat form of the lax equat

becaus the diagon matrix element of y are all zero we may rewrit the
first compon equat in 92b as

thi is the analog of eq91 in 8d

again eqs86ab tell us that it is
better to consid the motion of not just unit vector s f1 but all unit vector f j

1 we have found a lax pair with a correspond spectral paramet for a
system of 12 scalar pde and 12 scalar constitut relat govern
24 depend variabl in 11 dimens
2 when the spectral paramet goe to zero thi system of pde reduc
to the smk equat that describ the dynam of dna model as a
shearabl and extens elast rod

3 when three depend variabl are set to be constant the smk
equat reduc to a system of 9 scalar pde with 9 scalar constitut
relat in 18 depend variabl thi system describ the dynam
of dna model as an unshear and inextens elast rod
kirchhoff elast rod
4 when the smk equat are assum to be independ of t or s they
reduc to a set of 6 ode and 3 constitut relat for 9 depend
variabl describ the motion of a heavi top or the motion of a rigid
bodi in an ideal fluid
it is beyond the scope of thi paper to show in a mathemat rigor
fashion that each step in the reduct will or will not preserv the integr
properti of the pde in the sens of liouvil painlev lax or invers
