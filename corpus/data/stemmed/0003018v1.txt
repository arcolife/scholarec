abstract a veri elementari introduct to quantum algebra is present and a
few exampl of their physic applic are mention
i shall give a veri elementari introduct to the topic of quantum algebra and
mention a few physic applic quantum algebra or quantum group extend the domain of classic group theori and constitut a new and grow field
of mathemat with vast potenti for applic in physic in fact the origin
of quantum group lie in physic in the studi on the behaviour of integr system in quantum field theori and statist mechan use the quantum invers
scatter method by sklyanin kulish reshetikhin takhtajan and faddeev in
the 1980 mathemat abstract from the observ on the common featur of these system led to the definit of the concept of a quantum group and
the studi of drinfeld jimbo manin woronowicz conn wess zumino macfarlan biedenharn reveal mani aspect of quantum group from differ
mathemat and physic point of view i shall neither go into the histori of the
develop of the variou signific concept nor give ani specif refer to
their origin i shall cite at the end some book and articl which would give these
detail and lead to the vast literatur on the subject of quantum group and their
applic
let us consid a two dimension classic vector space whose element can be
written as

where a mean the transpos of the matrix a we say that the differenti calculu
on the two dimension x yplane is covari under the group sl2 r
in natur all physic system are quantum mechan but the quantum mechan behaviour is gener reveal onli at the microscop molecular and
deeper level at the macroscop level of everyday experi quantum physic
becom classic physic as an approxim so onli classic physic wa discov first and observ of failur of classic physic at the atom level led to
the discoveri of quantum physic in the 20th centuri thi passag from classic
physic to quantum physic can be mathemat describ as a process of deform of the classic physic wherein the commut classic observ of a
physic system are replac by noncommut hermitian oper thi process is
character by a veri small deform paramet known as the planck constant
h
and roughli speak in the limit h
0 classic physic is recov from the
structur of quantum physic
in analog with the process of quantiz the classic physic let us now quantiz the classic vector space to get a quantum vector space by assum that the
coordin do not commut with each other at ani point let us model the noncommut of the coordin x and y of a two dimension quantum plane
by
xy qy x

where q is the deform paramet which we shall consid in gener to be
ani nonzero complex number note that in the limit q 1 the noncommut
quantum coordin x and y becom commut classic coordin to be
specif let us choos

it is easi to find an exampl of such noncommut variabl let t and g be
oper act on function of a singl real variabl x such that
t x x
g x eix x

then for ani x
t g x eix x ei g t x

for a given fix valu of thu with the variat of t and g becom
noncommut variabl obey the relat

with fix valu for
now the interest question are
is it possibl to defin a differenti calculu on the two dimension x y plane
if so will it be covari under some gener of the classic group
sl2
the answer are ye ye first let us understand how one can give a mean
to partial deriv with respect to x and y these have to oper on the
space of function f x y which we shall consid to be polynomi in x and
y we can write f x y mn fmn x m y n sinc ani polynomi in x and y
with coeffici commut with x and y can be brought to thi form use the
commut relat 8 then if we take formal
m
x mx m1
x

13
we would have a differenti calculu in the x y plane as desir onc we pre
scribe consist the remain commut relat between x y x
and
y
without go into ani further detail let me state the complet set of commut relat defin the differenti calculu in the x y plane with q ei

in the theori of classic lie group we know that an element of a lie group g
say g can be written as
g e1 l1 e2 l2 en ln
29
where the paramet i character the group element g and li are constant
gener of the group g satisfi a lie algebra

with cijk as the structur constant when the group element g is close to the
ident element i of the group the paramet i are infinitesim and one can
write

now the interest question is
is there an analogu of the lie algebra in the case of a quantum group
the answer is ye to thi end first we have to recal some basic notion of the
theori of qseri
one defin the qshift factori by
x qn

32
then with the notat

the qnumber nq or the socal basic number wa defin by hein 1846
much of ramanujan work is relat to these qseri note that

37
thu ezq defin by 35 is a qgener of the exponenti function call a
qexponenti function note that there can be sever gener of the exponenti function satisfi the condit that in the limit q 1 it should becom the
standard exponenti function in the theori of quantum group a new definit of
the qnumber is often use it is
nq
q n q n
q q 1
38
note that nq also becom n in the limit q 1 and nq is symmetr with respect
to the interchang of q and q 1 unlik hein nq
now consid the 2dimension t matrix parametr as
t
a b
c d
e
e
e e e

which requir the variabl paramet to satisfi a lie algebra
log q
log q

so that a b c d obey the algebra 17 then one can write

in 42 provid the

they also provid the fundament represent of the gener of sl2 algebra 45 when a higher dimension represent of 44 is plug in the formula 43 t becom a higher dimension represent of the t matrix for exampl the three dimension represent 26 is obtain by substitut in 43

which provid the three dimension irreduc represent of the slq 2 algebra 44 and use the parametr of a b c d in term of as
given by 39 note that in the limit q 1 these matric 46 obey the sl2
algebra 45 as seen from 39 43 and 44 one can say that for a quantum
group the groupparamet space is noncommut
the algebra slq 2 is also often call a quantum group actual the relat
in 44 defin the gener of the qdeform of the univers envelop algebra
of sl2 henc the relat 44 are also refer to more properli as uq sl2
the qdeform univers envelop algebra of sl2 the algebra uq sl2 gener by polynomi in x0 x x obey the relat 44 is also a hopf
algebra we shall consid onli the coproduct for uq sl2 a coproduct for
slq 2 is
q x0 x0 1l 1l x0
q x x q x0 q x0 x
47
it can be easili verifi that thi comultipl rule is an algebra isomorph for
slq 2
q x0 q x q x
q x q x 2q x0 q
48
the most import properti of thi coproduct is it noncommut note that
the algebra 44 is invari under the interchang q q 1 sinc 2x0 q 2x0 q1
8
howev the comultipl 47 is not invari under such an interchang thi
mean that the comultipl obtain from 47 by an interchang q q 1
should also be an equal good comultipl it can be verifi that the coproduct
so obtain name
q1 x x q x0 q x0 x
q1 x0 x0 1l 1l x0
49
is inde an algebra isomorph for slq 2 thi coproduct 49 q1 is call the
opposit coproduct in view of the relat
q1 x q x where u v v u
50
sinc
q1 q
or
51
the comultipl q and q1 of slq 2 are noncommut in the limit q 1
the classic sl2 ha onli a singl comultipl x x 1l 1l x which
is commut ie
one can show that the two comultipl of sl2 q name q and q1
are relat to each other by an equival relat such that there exist an r
uq sl2 uq sl2 call the univers rmatrix satisfi the relat
q1 x rq x r1
52
thi univers rmatrix is the central object of the quantum group theori in thi
case it can be shown that
rq
2x0 x0
n
1 q 2 nn12 x0
q x q x0 x
q
nq

53
if we insert the matrix represent of x in thi express for r we get
numer rmatric for exampl substitut in 53 the 2 2 represent of
x given in 42 we get the fundament 4dimension rmatrix

let us now write ani r in the form

it is clear from 53 that thi can be done now defin

known as the quantum yangbaxt equat or simpli the yangbaxt equat ybe
we have consid onli the simplest exampl of a quantum group name
slq 2 associ with the classic group sl2 there exist a systemat theori
of deform of ani classic group it is also possibl in certain case to obtain
deform with sever qparamet actual the studi of quantum group
shed more light on the structur of the classic group theori i shall not go further
into the detail of the formal of quantum group theori
now i am in a posit to mention a few applic of quantum group and
algebra first let us see how these thing start defin

becaus a b c d ae noncommut the relat between t1 t2 and t2 t1 turn
out to be

60
thi type of relat is commonli encount in the quantum invers scatter
method approach to integr model in quantum field theori and statist mechan substitut in 60 r from 54 and t1 and t2 from 58 it is found that
equat 60 is a compact way of state the commut relat 17 defin
the fundament t matrix of slq 2 what about the commut relat 44

then the commut relat 44 defin the gener of slq 2 can be

62
note that the l matric are special realiz of the t matric ie the element of l matric obey the commut relat requir of the t matrix

if we defin for the rmatrix in 54

which is an altern form of the ybe 57 for ani gener rmatrix the ybe 57
can be put in thi form 65 thi relat 65 repres a properti of the gener of a braid group which is a gener of the well known symmetr group
sn the symmetr group sn is the group of all permut of n given object an
element of the braid group bn can be depict as a system of n string join two
set of n point each set locat on a line the two line say top and bottom be
parallel with overcross or undercross of the string the overcross
and the undercross of the string make bn an infinit group which will otherwis reduc to sn if i and i 1 are two consecut point on the top and bottom
line the string start at i on the top line can reach i 1 on the bottom line by
either undercross or overcross the string start at i 1 on the top line and
reach i on the bottom line the correspond element of the braid group are
usual denot by i and i1 respect the element i i 1 2 n 1
gener the braid group bn satisfi two relat

for i j 1
66
and
i i1 i i1 i i1
67
now compar the relat 65 and 67 it is obviou that the solut of the
ybe rmatric or the quantum algebra should play a central role in the theori of represent of braid group braid group have mani applic in
mathemat they are use in the studi of complex function of hypergeometr
type have sever variabl in physic they appear in knot theori statist
mechan twodimension conform field theori and so on
in quantum mechan the notion of continu spacetim with commut
coordin is taken over from classic mechan thi is an assumpt what will
happen if at some deeper microscop level the spacetim coordin themselv are
noncommut it is clear that to deal with such a situat one will have to use a
noncommut differenti calculu and the theori of quantum group provid the
necessari framework as we have seen abov for exampl consid the motion of a
quantum particl in a two dimension noncommut plane with x and y as the
coordin if we take the correspond conjug momenta to be proport to
and y
respect then the relat 14 indic how the twodimension
x
11
quantum mechan phasespac would be deform at that level thu the theori
of quantum group would provid the mathemat framework for the futur of
quantum physic if it turn out that at some deeper microscop level spacetim
manifold is noncommut henc there ha been a lot of interest in studi the
fundament modif that would occur in the framework quantum mechan
rel theori poincar group etc if the spacetim manifold happen to be
noncommut
apart from applic of fundament natur such as those mention abov
there have been mani phenomenolog applic of quantum algebra in nuclear physic condens matter physic molecular physic quantum optic and
elementari particl physic in these applic either an exist model is identifi with a quantum algebra structur or a standard model is deform to have
an underli quantum algebra structur and studi to reveal the new featur
emerg to give an idea of such applic let me mention as the final exampl the qdeform of the quantum mechan harmon oscil algebra also
known as the boson algebra the algebra treatment of the quantum mechan
harmon oscil involv a creation oper a an annihil oper a
and a number oper n obey the commut relat
n a a
a a 1
68
where n is a hermitian oper and a is the hermitian conjug of a the energi
spectrum of the harmon oscil is given by the eigenvalu of the hamiltonian
oper

h
aa a a

in the appropri unit take two such set of oscil oper a1 a1 n1
and a2 a2 n2 which are assum to commut with each other and defin

it is found that

and

72
thi lie algebra 72 is seen to be the same as the sl2 algebra 45 subject to the
hermit condit 71 and is known as su2 algebra the lie algebra of the
group su2 the su2 algebra is the algebra of three dimension rotat or
the rigid rotat with j0 j repres the angular momentum oper the
coproduct rule
j0 j0 1l 1l j0
j j 1l 1l j
12
73
for the algebra 72 obtain by set q 1 in 47 or 49 repres the rule
for addit of angular momenta correspondingli the relat 44 rewritten as
j0 j j
j j 2j0 q
74
j j
75
with the hermit condit
j0 j0
repres the suq 2 or uq su2 algebra or the qdeform version of the su2
algebra 72 one can say that suq 2 is the algebra of the qrotat for the
qangular momentum oper there are two possibl addit rule
q1 j0 j0 1l 1l j0
q1 j j q j0 q j0 j
76
as seen from 47 and 49 now the interest fact is that one ha a realiz of
suq 2 gener given by
j0

j a1 a2
j a2 a1
77
exactli analog to the su2 case 70 where the two set of oper
a1 a1 n1 and a2 a2 n2 commut with each other and obey within each
set the algebra
78
aa qa a q n
n a a
further n is hermitian and a a is a hermitian conjug pair the qdeform
oscil algebra 78 is known as the qoscil or the qboson algebra when
q 1 the qoscil algebra 78 reduc to the canon oscil algebra 68
as is easi to guess phenomenolog applic of quantum algebra in nuclear
and molecular spectroscopi involv the substitut of harmon oscil model
by the qoscil model and the rigid rotat model by the qrotat model such
applic lead to impress result show that the actual vibrationalrot
spectra of nuclei and molecul can be fit into scheme in which the number of phenomenolog qparamet requir are veri much fewer than the number of tradit phenomenolog paramet requir to fit the same spectral data somehow
such qdeform model seem to take into account more effici the anharmon of vibrat and the nonrigid of rotat in nuclear and molecular system
