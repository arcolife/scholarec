puriti level can greatli affect the figur of merit 16 in
addit the crystallin of the materi can affect the
observ figur of merit 17 final the method of nucleat or synthesi may affect the phase or morpholog
of the materi and so affect the figur of merit 19
we assum that the composit and noncomposit
variabl of each sampl can be chang independ
114 then instead of a grid search on the composit
and noncomposit variabl we consid choos the
variabl at random from the allow valu we also
consid choos the variabl in a fashion that attempt
to maxim the amount of inform gain from the
limit number of sampl screen via a quasirandom
lowdiscrep sequenc 20
we further consid perform multipl round of
screen incorpor feedback as the experi proce by treat the combinatori chemistri experi
as a mont carlo in the laboratori thi lead to sampl the experiment figur of merit e proport
to exp if is larg then the mont carlo procedur will seek out valu of the composit and noncomposit variabl that maxim the figur of merit
if is too larg howev the mont carlo procedur
will get stuck in rel lowli local maxima the
first round is initi by choos the composit and
noncomposit variabl at random from the allow
valu the variabl are chang in succeed round
as dictat by the mont carlo procedur
two way of chang the variabl are consid
randomli chang the variabl of a randomli chosen
sampl a small amount and exchang a subset of the
variabl between two randomli chosen sampl these
move are repeat until all the sampl in a round have
been modifi the valu of the figur of merit for the
propos new sampl are then measur whether to
accept the newli propos sampl or to keep the current
sampl for the next round is decid accord to the
detail balanc accept criterion for the random
chang of one sampl we find the metropoli accept

i introduct
the goal of combinatori materi discoveri is to find
composit of matter that maxim a specif materi properti 13 such as superconduct 4 magnetoresist 5 luminesc 68 ligand specif
9 sensor respons 10 or catalyt activ 21116
thi problem can be reformul as one of search
a multidimension space with the materi composit impur level and synthesi condit as variabl the properti to be optim the figur of merit
is gener an unknown function of the variabl and can
be measur onli experiment
present approach to combinatori librari design and
screen invari perform a grid search in composit
space follow by a steepestasc maxim of
the figur of merit thi procedur becom ineffici in
highdimension space or when the figur of merit is not
a smooth function of the variabl and it use ha limit
most combinatori chemistri experi to ternari or
quaternari compound
in thi paper we suggest new experiment protocol for search the space of variabl in combinatori
chemistri exploit an analog between combinatori
materi discoveri and mont carlo comput model method in section ii we discuss sever of these
strategi for librari design and redesign in section iii
we introduc the random phase volum model that we
will use to compar the differ method the effect of differ strategi is discuss in section iv we
conclud in section v
ii sampl the space of variabl in
materi discoveri
sever variabl can be manipul in order to seek
the materi with the optim figur of merit materi
composit is certainli a variabl but also film thick 17 and deposit method 18 are variabl for
materi made in thin film form the process histori such as temperatur pressur ph and atmospher

subspac is identifi by the gramschmidt procedur
move that violat the constraint xi 0 are reject
move that lead to invalid valu of the noncomposit

tial librari of sampl measur the initi figur of
merit chang the variabl of each sampl a small random amount or swap subset of the variabl between
pair of sampl construct the propos new librari
of sampl measur the figur of merit of the propos new sampl accept or reject each of the propos new sampl and perform parallel temper
exchang follow round of combinatori chemistri
repeat these step start with make chang to the
current valu of the composit and noncomposit
variabl these step are repeat for as mani round
as desir or until maxim figur of merit are found
we have chosen to sampl the figur of merit by mont
carlo rather than to optim it global by some other
method for sever reason first mont carlo is an
effect stochast optim method second simpl global optim may be mislead sinc concern
such as patent cost of materi and eas of synthesi are not usual includ in the experiment figur
of merit moreov the screen that is most easili perform in the laboratori the primari screen is usual
onli roughli correl with the true figur of merit inde after find materi that look promis base
upon the primari screen experiment secondari and
tertiari screen are usual perform to identifi that
materi which is truli optim third it might be advantag to screen for sever figur of merit at onc
for all of these reason sampl by mont carlo to produc sever candid materi is prefer over global
optim

the paramet is not relat to the thermodynam

iii the random phase volum model
the effect of these protocol is demonstr
by combinatori chemistri experi as simul by
the random phase volum model the random phase
volum model is not fundament to the protocol it is
introduc as a simpl way to test parameter and
valid the variou search method the model relat the figur of merit to the composit and noncomposit variabl in a statist way the model
is fast enough to allow for valid of the propos
search method on an enorm number of sampl
yet possess the correct statist for the figureofmerit
landscap the ddimension vector of composit mole
fraction is denot by x the composit mole fraction
are nonneg and sum to uniti and so the allow
composit are constrain to lie within a simplex in d
dimens for the familiar ternari system thi simplex
is an equilater triangl the composit variabl are
group into phase center around nx point x randomli place within the allow composit rang the
phase form a voronoi diagram 24 see fig 2 the
model is defin for ani number of composit variabl
and the number of phase point is defin by requir

where is the differ in the valu of between
the two group and e is the differ in the figur
of merit between the two sampl it is import to
notic that thi exchang step doe not involv ani extra screen compar to mont carlo and is therefor
free in term of experiment cost thi step is howev dramat effect at facilit the protocol to
escap from local maxima the number of differ system and the temperatur of each system are paramet
that must be optim
to summar the first round of combinatori chemistri consist of the follow step construct the ini2
the total number of sampl whose figur of merit will
be measur is fix at m 100 000 so that all protocol have the same experiment cost the singl pass

the averag space between phase point to be 025
to avoid edg effect addit point are ad in a
belt of width 2 around the simplex of allow composit the figur of merit should chang dramat between composit phase moreov within each phase
the figur of merit should also vari with y x x
due to crystallin effect such as crystallit size intergrowth defect and fault 17 in addit the noncomposit variabl should also affect the measur figur of merit the noncomposit variabl are denot
by the bdimension vector z with each compon constrain to fall within the rang 1 1 without loss of
gener there can be ani number of noncomposit
variabl the figur of merit depend on the composit and noncomposit variabl in a correl fashion and so the noncomposit variabl also fall within
nz zphase defin in the space of composit variabl there are a factor of 10 fewer noncomposit
phase than composit phase the function form of
the model when x is in composit phase and noncompositionphas is
is the volum of the allow composit simplex note
that the distanc from the centroid of the simplex to the
closest point on the boundari of the simplex is

and noncomposit variabl the feedback protocol
mont carlo mont carlo with swap and parallel temper are consid the mont carlo paramet were
optim on test case it wa optim to perform 100
round of 1000 sampl with 2 for d 3 and 1
for d 4 or 5 and x 01rd and z 012 for
the maximum random displac in each compon
the swap move consist of an attempt to swap all
of the noncomposit valu between the two chosen
sampl and it wa optim to use pswap 01 for the
probabl of a swap versu a regular random displac for parallel temper it wa optim to perform
100 round with 1000 sampl divid into three subset 50 sampl at 1 50 500 sampl at 2 10
and 450 sampl at 3 1 the 50 sampl at larg
essenti perform a steepestasc optim and
have smaller x 001rd and z 0012
the figur of merit found by the protocol are shown
in fig 3 the random and ld protocol find better solut than doe grid in one round of experi more
importantli the mont carlo method have a tremend advantag over one pass method especi as the
number of variabl increas with parallel temper
the best method the mont carlo method in essenc
gather more inform about how best to search the
variabl space with each succeed round thi feedback
mechan prove to be effect even for the rel
small total sampl size of 100000 consid here we
expect that the advantag of the mont carlo method
will becom even greater for larger sampl size note
that in case such as catalyt activ sensor respons
or ligand specif 25 the experiment figur of merit
would like be exponenti in the valu shown in fig 3
so that the success of the mont carlo method would be
even more dramat a better calibr of the paramet in eq 4 may be possibl as more data becom

v conclus
to conclud the experiment challeng in combinatori chemistri appear to lie mainli in the screen
method and in the technolog for the creation of the
librari the theoret challeng on the other hand
appear to lie mainli in the librari design and redesign
strategi we have address thi second question via
an analog with mont carlo comput simul and
we have introduc the random phase volum model to
compar variou strategi we find the multipleround
mont carlo protocol to be especi effect on the
more difficult system with larger number of composit and noncomposit variabl
an effici implement of the search strategi is
feasibl with exist librari creation technolog moreov close the loop between librari design and redesign is achiev with the same databas technolog
current use to track and record the data from combinatori chemistri experi these multipleround
protocol when combin with appropri robot control should allow the practic applic of combinatori chemistri to more complex and interest system
