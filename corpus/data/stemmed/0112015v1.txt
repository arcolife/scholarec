abstract
a problem pose in a remark by pauli is discuss is it possibl to
recov the state vector of a quantum system from the distribut
function of the physic observ of thi system
dedic to the memori of mk polivanov
is it possibl to recov the state vector of a quantummechan object
from the distribut function of measur observ in thi state thi
rather natur pose problem lead to complic mathemat problem
that are not current amen to solut we restrict ourselv here to
some simpl observ and a precis formul of the correspond
mathemat problem
the possibl state of a nonrelativist spinless particl are describ
by onedimension subspac of complex hilbert space l2 r3 kinemat one can specifi measur the distribut function of the coordin oper x the momentum oper p the angular momentum oper l x p and the oper of one of it project l we denot by

ei a basi of common eigenfunct of the oper l2 l and expand
the state vector j j 1 2 j l2 r3 with respect to thi basi

doe it follow from the relat 1 that 14 1 2 c vari
we can divid thi problem into the two follow problem
first it is necessari to describ the set of solut
l2 r3
x w1 x
p
w2 p
2
for fix function w1 and w2 thi formul of the problem is due to
pauli 5 p17
second it is necessari to consid selfadjoint oper a 1 m
in a finitedimension hilbert space h cn we assum that

how can one describ the set
ab x ai x bi
for fix b bi in particular under what condit on a 1 m
is the solut of these equat uniqu in pn1 c ie when x y
ab y x c
we do not know exhaust answer to these question and restrict
ourselv to the follow remark we refer the interest reader to the
2
cite literatur in which the physic formul of the problem and other
result are given
we begin with the finitedimension problem in thi case the follow
theorem hold 6
proposit 1 in the case m 3 n 9 one of the set ab contain
for some b at least two differ solut
proof suppos otherwis then the solut is uniqu therefor the
map

defin a continu embed of cpn1 in the sphere s 3n1 without
loss of gener it can be assum that ni1 ai x2 1 for 1 3
sinc 3n 1 322n 1 1 there exist a differenti embed
of cpn1 in s 3n1 7 therefor by the wellknown theorem 8 p390
3n 1 4n 1 2n 1
3
where k is the number of one in the binari expans of k for n 9
the inequ 3 doe not hold
in particular thi theorem show that the distribut of the three
project of the spin do not uniqu determin the spin state of the
system for suffici larg in absolut magnitud spin
the second observ is as follow we choos an odd prime p and
consid the space of function
x f f zpz c
it is clear that x cp we take two base

where

it is clear that a x and therefor

we note the follow infinitedimension analog of proposit 2 we
set
f x expix2
so that

it is clear that the distribut function f x f p do not depend on

propos by aharonov 9 it wa note quit long ago 1 10 that if one
set x x x x expix and defin the function 1 x
by
1 x x expix
then

and therefor 1 p p
if x x
thu choos in l2 r we find
x x for x r x 1 x
p 1 p for x p r
despit the fact that except for thi exampl we have not obtain ani
result in the case x l2 r one of us advanc the follow conjectur
conjectur am perelomov let f l2 r suppos that
x f x p
fp for almost all x p r then f or
f 1 for some c
in the gener case x l2 rl the consid exampl show that
p

for almost all x p rl where
x 0 x

therefor in gener it doe not follow from the relat 1 that 1 2
for some c 1 sinc the angular momentum is zero for spheric
symmetr state
in conclus we describ the subset of the set 2 that consist of gaussian exponenti we begin with the follow simpl remark
lemma let l2 r2 and c gll r set c x cx
we have
1 t

and

proof we have

we now set

x a exp xt ax

a gll c
assum that re a is a positivedefinit matrix let a a1 i a2 aj
gll r ajt aj for j 1 2 sinc the matrix a1 is posit definit
c t ac i diag 1 l
for same c gll c therefor
1
p

b1 diag 21 2l
and 0 j 1 for 1 j l thu we set
w1 x l2 exp

choos
b lj1 j
b1 diag 21 2l
so that

x w1 x exp ixt a2 x

the real symmetr matric b1 a2 b2 satisfi the relat
i ia2 b1 ib2 i
ie
b1 a2 b2 i
a2 b1 b2 0
thu it is suffici to find all in fact symmetr solut of the equat
a22 c for c i b1 b11 or c diag 1 2j 2
j it follow
from thi that the gener solut for our problem ha the form
a2 t d
t 1
d l
b1 b1
where the set
l diag j 2j 1 2j 2
j

1 j l
contain precis 2l element in other word the set of solut decompos into 2l orbit of the group g ol b1 b1
as a simpl exampl the idea is due to kontsevich 11 we consid
the set of function
x 0 x
o3
set
0 x a exp1 x2 i 2 x21 x22 x23
where
1 0
2 r 0
x r3
it is clear that
p 0 p
x 0 x
and l2 r3 for ani o3 in particular it can be seen that the set
2 can be infinit
one of the author bz moroz had the possibl of discuss the
question consid here with colleagu we take thi opportun of express our deep gratitud to them we are especi grate to yaharonov
