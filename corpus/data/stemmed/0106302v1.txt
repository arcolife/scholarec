introduct
one of the fascin aspect of protein molecul in the biolog world
is their abil to perform variou almost magiclik task 16 a particular class of protein known as molecular motor can move linearli along
it design track against an extern forc by util the biochem
energi sourc adenosin triphosph atp in thi manner the motor
protein act as miniatur engin convert chemic energi to mechan work movement of singl protein molecul insid a cell howev ha
1
to experi thermal agit from the aqueou environ in the cytosol the movement is therefor a brownian motion with drift convect
diffus 6
such movement provid the molecular basi for muscl contract and
variou cellular transport process 24 25 motor protein kinesin is known
to carri out intracellular vesicl transport along microtubul variou
polymeras are move along their correspond templat all these process are essenti to a live cell in a muscl cell the motor protein is
call myosin and it design track is call an actin filament the
actin filament ha a period structur of 36nm therefor without loss
of gener we assum that a myosin molecul move in a forc field with
period potenti energi function u x u x l u x where l is 36nm
for actin
treat the center of mass of the motor protein as a brownian motion with the presenc of a period energi potenti it movement can be
model by the smoluchowski equat 63

f x du xdx is the forc of the potenti u repres the molecular interact between the motor protein and it track p x t is the
probabl densiti function of the motor protein at posit x for time t
the first equal in eqn 1 is a continu equat in which j is a probabl flux the first term on the righthandsid is associ with the
diffus flux accord to fick law the second term is due to the convect associ with an overdamp newtonian motion x f x in
fact eqn 1 is mathemat equival to an overdamp newtonian

when the motion of a motor protein becom steadi and if we are onli
interest in the mean veloc we need onli consid the steadyst solut for x 0 l with period boundari condit with thi set
the steadyst veloc of the motor protein movement is v lj therefor studi on the steadyst movement focu on the flux j to fix our
terminolog we will refer to a stationari solut as a steadyst but a
stationari solut with zero flux as an equilibrium
a littl mathemat analysi immedi show that with u 0
u l ie 0l f xdx 0 the stationari solut of 1 allow onli zero
flux j 0 therefor in a onedimension period structur there is no
drive forc to bia an inert brownian particl to move in either direct
the simplest model given by eqn 1 fail to captur the essenc of motor
protein movement
the drive forc for a motor protein come from a veri import biochem reaction occur insid the protein call atp hydrolysi

where f x and gx are nonneg period function in term of thi
augment huxley model the motor protein can be either attach to or
detach from the filament with respect interact energi function
u x and u x in the origin huxl model u x 0 d are
the diffus friction coeffici of the motor protein in the attach and
detach state respect the attachdetach transit is coupl to the
atp hydrolysi therefor in 5 the biochem reaction is coupl to the
movement of the motor protein more importantli note that in either the
attach or detach state there is no bia for the motor protein movement
howev the attachdetach transit driven by the atp hydrolysi lead to
a bias motion of the motor protein j0 the chemic energi in atp
is convert to the mechan motion of the motor protein thi we shall
show
at thi point it is fascin to read the now classic work of huxley
on the theori of muscl contract which wa written decad befor the
discoveri of the motor protein molecul in it individu form the huxley
model work as follow p 281 of 25 initi the myosin m and actin
filament a are detach m oscil fluctuat back and forth about
it equilibrium posit o as a result of thermal agit with diffus
coeffici d for the brownian motion if a happen to be within the
rang of posit where f the rate of associ is not zero there is a
chanc that combin will take place thi event happen with a probabl character by the markov rate process when thi ha happen
the tension in the elast element f ie the molecular interact between
m and a will be exert on the actin thread by m and convers the
actin will exert the same forc with opposit sign on m as one can see
eqn 5 is the mathemat formul of thi model describ in word
reader who check huxley paper will find sever differ between hi
origin equat and 5 these differ aris becaus we have formul a microscop model for singl motor protein while a model for muscl
contract ha to deal with a larg number of myosin molecul it can be
4
shown that when string mani motor protein into a rigid chain huxley
origin equat can be deriv from eqn 5 26
sinc the work of huxley there have been mani investig follow
and expand the basic notion of the huxley equat most notabl are
the work of hill 22 23 who provid the huxley equat with a sound
thermodynam basi and the work of astumian and bier and peskin et
al who arriv at 5 from the langevin dynam stochast differenti
equat point of view 2 43 there is also a bodi of literatur on brownian
ratchet whose basic movement is character by equat ident to 5

eqn 5 is certainli an oversimplifi model for ani realist biolog system howev it captur the essenc of a theori which unifi

therebi it provid a concret model for chemomechan energi transduct in live organ henc it deserv further detail investig as
a topic in biophys and physic chemistri the mathemat treatment
of 5 ha been mainli in term of differenti equat howev the natur of brownian motion of the motor protein also call for a treatment of
5 in term of stochast process we will review some of the pertin

mathemat analys of sever limit case
of augment huxley equat
while the augment huxley eqn 5 is difficult to solv in gener
due to the nonloc nonequilibrium natur of the steadyst particular
limit case can be analyz to gain insight into the theoret model
in thi section we present some known and also some new result

it is import here to qualifi the term brownian ratchet which doe not involv

be obtain by the method of regular perturb 4 at thi point it is
import to notic the other flux the circular flux which move the motor protein forward in the state but move it backward in the state
therefor doe not contribut to the net transport but onli gener

recent work in mathemat physic on entropi product in nonequilibrium system 19 also focu on appropri set up the nonequilibrium
steadyst with an extern forc and a thermostat simultan act
on a hamiltonian system the forc suppli energi while the thermostat
remov heat in order to keep the system in a steadyst with bound energi thi lead to a random dynam system in which entropi product
is cogent defin 60 the smoluchowski approach we adopt ha a quit
similar set a drive forc due to chemic reaction rather than mechan forc and an implicit thermostat the smoluchowski equat is a
consequ of an overdamp newtonian system with maxwellian distribut for the veloc of the particl 63 in fact the diffus coeffici d
and friction coeffici in 1 defin the temperatur of the thermostat
t dkb the interest mathemat question are when these random dynam system becom diffus process and whether the entropi
product propos in these studi is equival to eqn 15 for diffus
process 54 the recent work by lebowitz and spohn 32 ha provid
some insight on thi problem 52 in a differ approach to weak random
perturb of hamiltonian system in a plane freidlin and wentzel map
the system to a diffus process on a graph which consist of vertic correspond to the stationari state and edg correspond to energi basin
18 howev thi approach remain to be gener to higher dimension
hamiltonian system and it relationship to the kramer transitionst
rate theori in theoret chemistri 21 also remain to be elucid
it is interest to note that in a steadyst the flux j is a constant

to gener the concept of entropi product to eqn 5 is mathemat straightforward thi yield a novel thermodynam theori for

the theori is that it relat epr to the heat product of a work motor

there is an altern view of a stochast process in term of it trajectori
in thi approach all possibl trajectori xt t 0 form a function space

determinist vs stochast motion of molecular motor
while there is no doubt that the motor protein movement is a drift brwonian motion the extent of the random in the motion can be quantita14
tive character accord to the mathemat model let now again
consid eqn 5 in which there is no forc in the detach state as
we have discuss abov in the limit of both d 0 the motion will be
trap at the zero of f x thi indic the import of nonzero d
for the motor movement in thi model as ha been repeatedli point out
by peskin et al 42 43
on the other hand when f x 0 a motor protein can move strictli
in one direct in a random evolut model diffus play no role in
thi mechan these two differ mode of movement correspond nice
with brownian ratchet and power stroke in the biochem literatur
whether a motor protein in fact move backandforth with a drift or almost unidirect consecut can be quantit analyz until now
there ha no quantit mean to differenti these two type of motion
the present theori offer a quantiti method to address thi issu take

as the total movement of the protein note that the first term is associ with the brownian motion and the second term is associ with the

futur work
while the detail mathemat analys remain to be carri out for
model of singl motor movement the mathemat analysi of a chain of
motor protein is larg unknown except for the complet rigid chain of
motor huxley model the gener theori can be develop by connect
n motor protein by spring such a beadandspr model ha been the
theoret foundat of polym physic 12 48 the late professor pj
flori wa award the nobel prize in chemistri in 1974 for hi contribut
to thi theori the differ howev is that a polym is an equilibrium
system while a chain of motor is a live creatur let denot the
posit of n motor protein by x1 x2 xn and the correspond
intern state by 1 2 n where k 0 1 for the detach and
