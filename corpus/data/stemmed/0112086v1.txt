the lep era ha brought immens progress in search for higg boson over the last 12 year which will
guid search at futur collid the evolut of the higg boson mass limit is review with the focu on

can also be interpret as a prefer for a higg boson of that mass in the mssm further small data excess

1 introduct
the search for higg boson ha been one of
the most import line of research dure the
lep era final lep1 result from data taken at
the zreson 1 and preliminari lep2 result
for complet data up to 209 gev centerofmass
energi 2 were recent review the mssm is
well motiv and the most discuss extens
of the sm it predict three neutral h h and a
and two charg higg boson at the begin
of lep oper in 1989 no radi correct
to the neutral higg boson mass were calcul
and mh mz wa predict first and secondord correct increas the upper mass bound
to about 130 gev the neutral higg boson
mass and product cross section strongli
depend on variou model paramet at lep
two way were chosen to present the mass limit benchmark limit for a certain set of mssm
paramet and mass limit base on mssm paramet scan detail of the benchmark and scan
paramet are given for exampl in ref 34

the import of a mssm paramet scan to

show that the h mass limit is reduc from 41 to
25 gev in a paramet scan compar to benchmark result 56

the import of paramet scan is stress by
