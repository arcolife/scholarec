abstract
a gener notion of algebra condit plausibl measur is de ned probabl
measur rank function possibl measur and under the appropri de nition
set of probabl measur can all be view as de ning algebra condit plausibl
measur it is shown that algebra condit plausibl measur can be repres
use bayesian network
1 introduct
pearl 1988 among other ha long argu that bayesian network that is the dag without the condit probabl tabl repres import qualit inform about
uncertainti regard condit depend and independ to the extent that thi
is true bayesian network should make perfect sens for nonprobabilist represent
of uncertainti and inde bayesian network have been use with rank spohn
1988 by darwich and goldszmidt 1994 it follow from result of wilson 1994 that
possibl measur duboi prade 1990 can be repres use bayesian network
the question i address in thi paper is what properti of a represent of uncertainti are requir to be abl to repres the uncertainti use a bayesian network thi
question too ha been address in earlier work see darwich 1992 darwich ginsberg
1992 friedman halpern 1995 wilson 1994 although the character given here
is somewhat di erent shenoy and shafer 1990 consid a relat questionessenti
what is requir of a represent of uncertainti so that margin can be comput use
local comput of the type use in bayesian networksand provid axiom su cient
to guarante that thi is possibl
here i repres uncertainti use plausibl measur as in friedman halpern
1995 to answer the question i must examin gener properti of condit plausibl
as well as de ning a notion of plausibilist independ unlik earlier paper i enforc a
symmetri condit in the de nition of condit independ so that for exampl a is
independ of b i b is independ of a while thi properti hold for probabl under
the asymmetr de nition of independ use in earlier work it doe not necessarili hold
for other formal there are also subtl but import di erenc between thi paper
and friedman halpern 1995 in the notion of condit plausibl the de nition
here are simpler but more gener particular attent is paid here to condit on when
the condit plausibl must be de ned
the major result here are a gener condit simpler than that given in friedman
halpern 1995 wilson 1994 under which a condit plausibl measur sati es the
c 2001 ai access foundat and morgan kaufmann publish all right reserv
halpern
semigraphoid properti which mean it can be repres use a bayesian network
condit are also given that su ce for a bayesian network to be abl to quantit
repres a plausibl measur more precis condit are given so that a plausibl
measur can be uniqu reconstruct given condit plausibl tabl for each node in
the bayesian network condit for quantit represent by bayesian network do
not seem to have been present in the literatur for represent of uncertainti other
than probabl for which the condit are trivial a minor addit condit also
su ce to guarante that dsepar in the network character condit independ all these condit clearli appli to rank and possibl measur perhap
more interestingli they also appli to set of probabl under a novel represent of
such set as a plausibl measur thi novel represent and the associ notion of
condit is shown to have some natur properti not share by other represent
the rest of the paper is organ as follow in section 2 i discuss condit plausibl measur section 3 introduc algebra condit plausibl measur which
are one where there is essenti an analogu to and put such an algebra
structur on uncertainti is not new it wa also done in darwich 1992 darwich ginsberg 1992 friedman halpern 1995 weydert 1994 section 4 discuss independ
and condit independ in condit plausibl space and show that algebra
condit plausibl measur satisfi the semigraphoid properti final in section 5
bayesian network base on algebra plausibl measur are consid combin
the fact that algebra plausibl measur satisfi the semigraphoid properti with the
result of geiger verma pearl 1990 it follow that dsepar in a bayesian network g impli condit independ for all algebra plausibl measur compat
with g a weak rich condit is shown to yield the convers the paper conclud in
section 6 longer proof are releg to the appendix
2 condit plausibl
21 uncondit plausibl measur
befor get to condit plausibl measur it is perhap best to consid uncondit plausibl measur the basic idea behind plausibl measur is straightforward
a probabl measur map subset of a set w to 0 1 it domain may not consist of
all subset of w howev it is requir to be an algebra recal that an algebra f over
w is a set of subset of w contain w and close under union and complement
so that if u v 2 f then so are u v and u a plausibl measur is more gener it
map element in an algebra f to some arbitrari partial order set if pl is a plausibl
measur then we read plu as the plausibl of set u if plu plv then v is at
least as plausibl as u becaus the order is partial it could be that the plausibl of
two di erent set is incompar an agent may not be prepar to say of two set that
one is more like than anoth or that they are equal in likelihood
formal a plausibl space is a tupl s w f pl where w is a set of world f
is an algebra over w and pl map set in f to some set d of plausibl valu partial
order by a relat d so that d is re exiv transit and antisymmetr that
contain two special element d and d such that d d d d d for all d 2 d these
are intend to be the analogu of 1 and 0 for probabl as usual the order is de ned

condit plausibl measur and bayesian network
d by take d1 d d2 if d1 d d2 and d1 6 d2 i omit the subscript d from d d d
and d whenev it is clear from context
there are three requir on plausibl measur the rst two are obviou analogu of requir that hold for other notion of uncertainti the whole space get
the maximum plausibl and the empti set get the minimum plausibl the third
requir say that a set must be at least as plausibl as ani of it subset
pl1 pl d
pl2 plw d
pl3 if u u 0 then plu plu 0
in pl3 i am implicitli assum that u u 0 2 f similar assumpt are made throughout
all the standard represent of uncertainti in the literatur can be repres as
plausibl measur i brie y describ some other represent of uncertainti that will
be of relev to thi paper
set of probabl one common way of repres uncertainti is by a set of probabl measur thi set is often assum to be convex see for exampl campo moral
1995 cousa moral walley 1999 gilboa schmeidler 1993 levi 1985 walley 1991
for discuss and further refer howev convex set do not seem appropri for repres independ assumpt so i do not make thi restrict here for exampl
if a coin with an unknown probabl of head is toss twice and the toss are known to
be independ it seem that a reason represent is given by the set p0 consist
of all measur where hh 2 ht th 1 tt 1 2
unfortun p0 is not convex moreov it convex hull includ mani measur for
which the coin toss are not independ it is argu in cousa et al 1999 that a set
of probabl measur is behavior equival to it convex hull howev even if we
accept thi argument it doe not follow that a set and it convex hull are equival insofar
as determin of independ goe
there are a number of way of view a set p of probabl measur as a plausibl
measur one use the lower probabl p de ned as p u inf f u 2 pg clearli
p sati es pl13 the correspond upper probabl p de ned as p u supf 2
pg 1 p u is also clearli a plausibl measur
both p and p give a way of compar the likelihood of two subset u and v of w
these two way are incompar it is easi to nd a set p of probabl measur on w
and subset u and v of w such that p u p v and p u p v rather than
choos between p and p we can associ a di erent plausibl measur with p that
captur both let dp p fa b 0 a b 1g and de ne a b a0 b0 i b a0
thi put a partial order on dp p clearli dp p 0 0 and dp p 1 1 de ne
plp p u p u p u thu plp p associ with a set u two number that can
be thought of as de ning an interv in term of the lower and upper probabl of u it
is easi to check that plp p u plp p v if the upper probabl of u is less than or
equal to the lower probabl of v plp p sati es pl13 so it is inde a plausibl
measur but one which put onli a partial order on event
361
halpern
the troubl with p p and even plp p is that they lose inform for exampl
it is not hard to nd a set p of probabl measur and subset u v of w such that
u
v for all 2 p and u v for some 2 p but p u p v and
p u p v inde there exist an in nite set p of probabl measur such that
u v for all 2 p but p u p v and p u p v if all the probabl
measur in p agre that u is less like than v it seem reason to conclud that u is
less like than v howev none of p p or plp p will necessarili draw thi conclus
fortun it is not hard to associ yet anoth plausibl measur with p that
doe not lose thi import inform for technic conveni that will becom clear
later assum that there is some index set i such that p f i i 2 i g thu for exampl
if p f 1 n g then i f1 ng let di 0 1i that is the function from i to
0 1 with the pointwis order so that f g i f i gi for all i 2 i 1 it is easi to
check that d is the function f i 0 1 such that f i 0 for all i 2 i and d is the
function g such that gi 1 for all i 2 i for u w let fu be the function such that
fu i iu for all i 2 i for exampl for the set p0 of measur repres the two
coin toss which is index by ir the set w can be taken to be fhh ht tt thg then
for exampl ffhhg hh 2 and ffhtttg 1
it is easi to see that f d and fw d now de ne plp u fu thu
plp u plp v i fu i fv i for all i 2 i i u v for all 2 p clearli plp
sati es pl13 pl1 and pl2 follow sinc plp f d and plp w fw d
while pl3 follow sinc if u v then u
v for all 2 p plp captur all the
inform in p unlik say p which wash much of it away by take inf
thi way of associ a plausibl measur with a set p of probabl measur
gener it provid a way of associ a singl plausibl measur with ani set of
plausibl measur i leav the straightforward detail to the reader
possibl measur a fuzzi measur or a sugeno measur f on w wang klir
1992 is a function f 2w 7 0 1 that sati es pl13 that is it is less gener than a
plausibl measur onli in that it requir the rang to be 0 1 rather than an arbitrari
partial order set a possibl measur poss on w is a special case of a sugeno measur
it is a function map subset of w to 0 1 such that possw 1 poss 0 and
possu supw2u possfwg so that possu v maxpossu possv duboi
prade 1990 clearli a possibl measur is a plausibl measur
rank function an ordin rank or rank or rank function on w as
de ned by goldszmidt pearl 1992 base on idea that go back to spohn 1988
is a function map subset of w to in in f1g such that w 0
1 and u minw2u fwg so that u v min u v intuit a
rank function assign a degre of surpris to each subset of world in w where 0 mean
unsurpris and higher number denot greater surpris it is easi to see that if is a
rank function on w then w 2w is a plausibl space where x in y if and onli
if y x under the usual order on the natur number one standard view of a rank

condit plausibl measur and bayesian network
function go back to spohn is that a rank of k can be associ with a probabl
of k for some xed possibl in nitesim note that thi viewpoint justi es take
w 0 1 and u v min u v
22 condit plausibl measur
sinc bayesian network make such heavi use of condit my interest here is not just
plausibl measur but condit plausibl measur cpm given a set w of
world a cpm map pair of subset of w to some partial order set d i write plu jv
rather than plu v in keep with standard notat for condit in the case of
a probabl measur it is standard to take u jv to be und ned in v 0 in
gener we must make precis what the allow second argument are thu i take
the domain of a cpm to have the form f f 0 where intuit f 0 consist of those set
in f on which it make sens to condit for exampl for a condit probabl
measur de ned in the usual way from an uncondit probabl measur f 0 consist
of all set v such that v 0 note that f 0 is not an algebrait is not close under
complement a popper algebra over w is a set f f 0 of subset of w w satisfi
the follow properti
acc1 f is an algebra over w
acc2 f 0 is a nonempti subset of f
acc3 f 0 is close under superset in f that is if v 2 f 0 v
v 0 2 f 0
v 0 and v 0 2 f then
popper algebra are name after karl popper who wa the rst to consid formal
condit probabl as the basic notion popper 1968 de finetti 1936 also did some
earli work appar independ take condit probabl as primit inde
as renyi 1964 point out the idea seem to go back as far as keyn 1921
a condit plausibl space cp is a tupl w f f 0 pl where f f 0 is a popper
algebra over w pl f f 0 d d is a partial order set of plausibl valu and pl
is a condit plausibl measur cpm that sati es the follow condit
cpl1 pljv d
cpl2 plw jv d
cpl3 if u
u 0 then plu jv plu 0 jv
cpl4 plu jv plu v jv
cpl13 are the obviou analogu to pl13 cpl4 is a minim properti that guarante
that when condit on v everyth is relativ to v it follow easili from cpl14
that pl jv is a plausibl measur on v for each xed v a cp is accept if it sati es
acc4 if v 2 f 0 u 2 f and plu jv 6 d then u v 2 f 0
363
halpern
accept is a gener of the observ that if prv 6 0 then condit on
v should be de ned it say that if plu jv 6 d then condit on v u should be
de ned
cpl14 are rather minim requir for exampl they do not place ani constraint
on the relationship between plu jv and plu jv 0 if v 6 v 0 one natur addit
condit is the follow
cpl5 if v v 0 2 f 0 and u u 0 2 f then plu jv v 0 plu 0 jv v 0 i plu v jv 0
plu 0 v jv 0
it is not hard to show that cpl5 impli cpl4
lemma 21 cpl5 impli cpl4
proof sinc clearli plu v jv plu v v jv by cpl5 it follow that plu jv v
plu v jv v and henc plu jv plu v jv
cpl5 doe not follow from cpl14 inde as shown below the standard notion of
condit for lower probabl sati es cpl14 but not cpl5 a cp that sati es
cpl5 is said to be coher although i do not assum cpl5 here it in fact hold for all
plausibl measur to which one of the main result appli see lemma 35
in ani case cpl5 is certainli not the onli coher that might be requir for
exampl it may seem reason to requir that if v and v 0 are disjoint then it is not the
case that both plu jv v 0 plu jv and plu jv v 0 plu jv 0 similarli we may
want to requir that it not be the case that plu jv v 0 plu jv and plu jv v 0
plu jv 0 2 come up with a reason set of coher condit remain a topic for
futur work the onli properti need for the result of thi paper are cpl14
the notion of cp consid here is close relat to that de ned in friedman
halpern 1995 there a cp is taken to be a famili fw dv plv v w v 6 g of
plausibl space where each plausibl measur plv sati es pl13 and ha domain 2w
and an analogu of cpl5 hold plv v 0 u plv v 0 u 0 i plv 0 u v plv 0 u 0 v to
distinguish the de nition of cp given in thi paper from that given in friedman halpern
1995 i call the latter an fhcp there is no analogu to acc14 in friedman halpern
1995 f is implicitli taken to be 2w while f 0 is implicitli taken to be 2w fg thi is
an inessenti di erenc between the de nition more signi cantli note that in an fhcp
w dv plv is a plausibl space for each xed v and thu sati es pl13 howev
requir cpl13 is a priori stronger than requir pl13 for each separ plausibl
space pl1 requir that pljv d but the element d may be di erent for each
v by way of contrast cpl1 requir that pljv must be the same element d for all
v similar remark hold for pl2 nevertheless as is shown below there is a construct
that convert an fhcp to a coher cp
i now consid some standard way of get a cp start with an uncondit
represent of uncertainti
de nition 22 a cp w f f 0 pl extend an uncondit plausibl space w f pl0
if plu jw pl0 u w f f 0 pl is standard if f 0 fu plu 6 g
all the construct below result in standard cpss

rank function given an uncondit rank function there is a wellknown
way of extend it to a condit rank function
u v v if v 6 1
u jv und

if v 1
thi is consist with the view that if v k then v k sinc then u jv
u v v it is easi to check that thi de nition result in a coher cp
possibl measur there are two standard way of de ning a condit possibl
measur from an uncondit possibl measur poss to distinguish them i write
possu jv for the rst approach and possu jjv for the second approach accord to the
rst approach
8
possv u if possv u possv
if possv u possv 0
possu jv 1
und ned if possv 0
the second approach look more like condit in probabl
possv u possv if possv 0
possu jjv und
ned
if possv 0
it is easi to show that both de nition result in a coher cp mani other notion of
condit for possibl measur can be de ned see for exampl fonck 1994 i focu
on these two becaus they are the one mostoften consid in the literatur
set of probabl for a set p of probabl condit can be de ned for all
the represent of p as a plausibl measur but in each case there are subtl choic
involv when condit is und ned for exampl one de nition of condit lower
probabl is that p u jv is inf f u jv v
6 0g if v 6 0 for all 2 p and is
und ned otherwis ie if v 0 for some 2 p it is easi to check that p de ned
thi way give a coher cpm as doe the correspond de nition of p the problem
with thi de nition is that it may result in a rather small set f 0 for which condit
is de ned for exampl if for each set v 6 w there is some measur 2 p such that
v 0 which can certainli happen in some nontrivi exampl then f 0 fw g as
a consequ the cp de ned in thi way is not accept ie doe not satisfi acc4 in
gener
the follow de nition give a lower probabl which is de ned on more argument
f u jv v 6 0g if v 6 0 for some 2 p
p u jv inf
und ned
if v 0 for all 2 p
it is easi to see that thi de nition agre with the rst one whenev the rst is de ned and
result in gener in a larger set f 0 moreov the result cp is accept howev
the second de nition doe not satisfi cpl5 for exampl suppos that w fa b cg and
p f 0 g where a b 0 c 1 0a 23 0b 13 and 0c 0
365
halpern
take v fa bg u fag and u 0 fbg it is easi to see that accord to the second
de nition p u v jw p u 0 v jw 0 but p u jv p u 0 jv
for plp there are two analog de nition for the rst plp u jv is de ned onli if
v 0 for all 2 p in which case plp u jv is fu jv where fu jv i i u jv thi
de nition give a coher cp but again in gener not one that is accept in thi
paper i focu on the follow de nition which doe result in an accept cp
first extend di by allow function which have valu intuit denot unden more precis let di0 consist of all function f from i to 0 1 f g such that f i 6
for at least one i 2 i the idea is to de ne plp u jv fu jv where fu jv i i u jv
if i v 0 and otherwis note that thi agre with the previou de nition which
appli onli to the situat where v 0 for all 2 p there is a problem though
one to which i have alreadi allud cpl1 say that fjv must be for all v thu it
must be the case that fjv1 fjv2 for all v1 v2 w but if i 2 p and v1 v2 w are
such that i v1 0 and iv2 0 then fjv1 i 0 and fjv2 i so fjv1 6 fjv2 a
similar problem aris with cpl2
to deal with thi problem di0 must be slightli modi ed say that f 2 di0 is equival
to d if f i is either 0 or for all i 2 i similarli f is equival to d if f i is
either 1 or for all i 2 i sinc by de nition f i
6 for at least one i 2 i an
element cannot be equival to both d and d let di be the same as di0 except
that all element equival to d are identi ed and view as one element and all
element equival to d are identi ed more precis let di fd d g ff 2 d0
f is not equival to d or d g de ne the order on di by take f g if one of
the follow three condit hold

neither f nor g is d or d and for all i 2 i either f i gi or f i 6

3 algebra condit plausibl measur
to be abl to carri out the type of reason use in bayesian network it doe not su ce to
just have condit plausibl we need to have analogu of addit and multipl
more precis there need to be some way of comput the plausibl of the union of
two disjoint set in term of the plausibl of the individu set and a way of comput
plu v jv 0 given plu jv v 0 and plv jv 0

it may seem more natur to consid a stronger version of alg4 that appli to all pair

howev as proposit 32 below show by requir that alg3 and alg4 hold onli for
tupl in dom and dom rather than on all tupl in d d some cpss of interest
becom algebra that would otherwis not be intuit we care about mainli to the
extent that alg1 and alg2 hold and alg1 and alg2 appli onli to tupl in dom and
dom respect thu it doe not seem unreason that alg4 be requir to hold
onli for these tupl
proposit 32 the construct for extend an uncondit probabl measur
rank function possibl measur use either possu jv or possu jjv and the plausibl measur plp de ned by a set p of probabl measur to a cp result in algebra
cpss4
proof it is easi to see that in each case the cp is accept it is also easi to nd
appropri notion of and in the case of probabl measur rank function and
possibl measur use possu jjv for probabl clearli and are essenti
and howev sinc the rang of probabl is 0 1 a b must be de ned as max1 a b
and alg3 hold onli for dom fa1 ak a1 ak 1g there is no constraint on
dom it is 0 1 0 1 for rank and are min and there are no constraint
on dommin and dom for possu jjv is max and is again there are no
constraint on dommax and dom i leav it to the reader to check that alg14 hold
in all these case

4 independ
how can we captur formal the notion that two event are independ intuit it
mean that they have noth to do with each otherthey are total unrel the occurr of one ha no in uenc on the other none of the represent of uncertainti
that we have been consid can express the notion of unrelated whatev it might
370
condit plausibl measur and bayesian network
mean directli the best we can do is to captur the footprint of independ on the
notion for exampl in the case of probabl if u and v are unrel it seem reason to expect that learn u should not a ect the probabl of v and symmetr
learn v should not a ect the probabl of u unrelated is after all a symmetr
notion6 the fact that u and v are probabilist independ with respect to probabl measur can thu be express as u jv u and v ju v there is a
technic problem with thi de nition what happen if v 0 in that case u jv is
und ned similarli if u 0 then v ju is und ned it is convent to say that
in thi case u and v are still independ thi lead to the follow formal de nition
de nition 41 u and v are probabilist independ with respect to probabl measur if v
6 0 impli u jv u and u 6 0 impli v ju v
thi doe not look like the standard de nition of independ in text but an easi
calcul show that it is equival
proposit 42 the follow are equival
a u 6 0 impli v ju v
b u v u v
c v 6 0 impli u jv u
thu in the case of probabl it would be equival to say that u and v are independ with respect to if u v u v or to requir onli that u jv u
if v 6 0 without requir that v ju v if u 6 0 howev these equival do not necessarili hold for other represent of uncertainti the de nition of
independ i have given here seem to gener more appropriately7
the de nition of probabilist condit independ is analog
de nition 43 u and v are probabilist independ given v 0 with respect to probabl measur if v v 0 6 0 impli u jv v 0 u jv 0 and u v 0 6 0 impli
v ju v 0 v jv 0
it is immedi that u and v are probabilist independ i they are independ
condit on w
the gener to condit plausibl measur and henc to all other represent of uncertainti that we have been consid is straightforward
de nition 44 given a cp w f f 0 pl u v 2 f are plausibilist independ
given v 0 2 f with respect to the cpm pl written ipl u v jv 0 if v v 0 2 f 0 impli
plu jv v 0 plu jv 0 and u v 0 2 f 0 impli plv ju v 0 plv jv 0
6 walley 1991 call the asymmetr notion irrelev and de ne u be independ of v as u is
irrelev to v and v is irrelev to u although my focu here is independ irrelev is an
interest notion in it own right see cozman 1998 cozman walley 1999
7 anoth properti of probabilist independ is that if u is independ of v then u is independ
of v thi too doe not follow for the other represent of uncertainti and walley 1991 actual
make thi part of hi de nition ad thi requir would not a ect ani of the result here
although it would make the proof somewhat lengthier so i have not made it part of the de nition

we are interest in condit independ of random variabl as well as in condit independ of event all the standard de nition extend to plausibl in a
straightforward way a random variabl x on w is a function from w to the real let
rx be the set of possibl valu for x that is the set of valu over which x rang as
usual x x is the event fw x w xg if x fx1 xk g is a set of random variabl
and x x1 xk let x x be an abbrevi for the event x1 x1 xk xk
a random variabl is measur with respect to cp w f f 0 pl if x x 2 f for all
x 2 rx for the rest of the paper i assum that all random variabl x are measur and that rx is nite for all random variabl x random variabl x and y are
independ with respect to plausibl measur pl if the event x x and y y are
independ for all x 2 rx and y 2 ry more gener given set x y and z of
random variabl x and y are plausibilist independ given z with respect to pl
denot iplrv x yjz if ipl x x y xjz z for all x y and z note that i am use
ipl for condit independ of event and iplrv for condit independ of random
variabl if z then iplrv x yjz if x and y are uncondit independ that
is if ipl x x y xjw for all x y if either x or y then iplrv x yjz is taken
to be vacuous true
now consid the follow four properti of random variabl call the semigraphoid
properti pearl 1988 where x y and z are pairwis disjoint set of variabl
cirv1 if iplrv x yjz then iplrv y xjz
cirv2 if iplrv x y y0 jz then iplrv x yjz
cirv3 if iplrv x y y0 jz then iplrv x yjy0 z
cirv4 if iplrv x yjz and iplrv x y0 jy z then iplrv x y y0 jz
it is well known that cirv14 hold for probabl measur the follow result
gener thi the proof is not di cult although care must be taken to show that the
result depend onli on the properti of algebra cpm
theorem 45 cirv14 hold for all algebra cpss
proof see the appendix
theorem 45 of cours is veri depend on the de nition of condit independ
given here other notion of independ have been studi in the literatur for speci c
represent of uncertainti perhap the most common de nition tri to gener the
observ that if u and v are probabilist independ then u v u v
zadeh 1978 consid thi approach in the context of possibl measur call it
noninteract but it clearli make sens for ani algebra cpm
de nition 46 u and v do not interact given v 0 with respect to the algebra cpm pl

8 shenoy 1994 de ne a notion similar in spirit to noninteract for random variabl
372
condit plausibl measur and bayesian network
fonck 1994 show that noninteract is strictli weaker than independ for a number of notion of independ for possibl measur the follow result show that
independ impli noninteract for all algebra cpm
lemma 47 if w f f 0 pl is an algebra cp then iplu v jv 0 impli ni plu v jv 0
proof suppos that v 0 2 f 0 and iplu v jv 0 hold if v v 0 2 f 0 then from alg2 it
follow that
plu v jv 0 plu jv v 0 plv jv 0 plu jv 0 plv jv 0
on the other hand if v v 0 2 f 0 then by acc4 plv jv 0 by cpl3 plu v jv 0
and by lemma 33 plu jv 0 plv jv 0 thu plu v jv 0 plu jv 0 plv jv 0
what about the convers to lemma 47 the result of fonck show that it doe not hold
in generalinde it doe not hold for possu jv so what is requir for noninteract
to impli independ the follow lemma provid a su cient condit
lemma 48 if w f f 0 pl is a standard algebra cp that sati es alg40 then ni plu v jv 0
impli ipl u v jv 0
proof suppos that v v 0 2 f 0 and ni plu v jv 0 then by alg2
plu v jv 0 plu jv v 0 plv jv 0

by acc3 v 0 2 f 0 so ni pl u v jv 0 impli
plu v jv 0 plu jv 0 plv jv 0

sinc v v 0 2 f 0 and w f f 0 pl is standard plv v 0
6 sinc plv v 0
plv jv 0 plv 0 it follow from lemma 34 that plv jv 0
6 so by alg40 2
0
0
and 3 it follow that plu jv v plu jv an ident argument show that
plv ju v 0 plv jv 0 if u v 0 2 f 0 thu iplu v jv 0
lemma 47 and 48 show whi noninteract and independ coincid for condit
probabl de ned from uncondit probabl rank function and possibl measur use possu jjv moreov they suggest whi they do not coincid in gener sinc
neither possu jv nor plp satisfi alg40 it is perhap not surpris that in neither case
doe noninteract impli condit independ we shall shortli see an exampl in
the case of plp fonck 1994 give exampl in the case of possu jv inde noninteract may not even impli condit independ for an arbitrari condit probabl
measur as the follow exampl show
exampl 49 suppos that w fa bg f 2w f 0 f fg a 1 b 0 but
bjb 1 it is easi to see that fbg is not independ of itself but fbg doe not interact
with fbg sinc b b b nevertheless it is not hard to check that thi condit
probabl measur is algebra and in fact sati es alg40 howev it is not standard
sinc fbg 2 f 0 although b 0
373
halpern
it is easi to see that the assumpt of standard is necessari in lemma 48 for
suppos that w f f 0 pl is an arbitrari nonstandard algebra cp for which
6
sinc w f f 0 pl is nonstandard there must exist some u 2 f 0 such that plu jw
but then
pljw plju plu jw
thu
plu jw plu jw plu jw
so ni plu u jw but plu ju 6 plu so ipl u u jw doe not hold
in gener theorem 45 doe not hold if we use ni pl rather than ipl that is alg14
do not su ce to ensur that cirv14 hold for ni pl besid noninteract a number of
di erent approach to de ning independ for possibl measur campo huet
1999a 1999b duboi farina del cerro herzig prade 1994 fonck 1994 and for set
of probabl measur campo huet 1993 campo moral 1995 cousa et al
1999 have been consid in gener theorem 45 doe not hold for them either it is
beyond the scope of thi paper to discuss and compar these approach to that consid
here but it is instruct to consid independ for set of probabl measur in a
littl more detail especi for the represent plp
de campo and moral 1995 de ne what the call type1 independ u and v
are type1 independ condit on v 0 with respect to p if u and v are independ
condit on v 0 with respect to everi 2 p it is easi to check that type1 independ
is equival to noninteract in the context of set of probabl measur thu by
lemma 47 iplp u v jv 0 impli that u and v are type1 independ condit on
v 0 and similarli for random variabl howev the convers doe not necessarili hold
becaus the two approach treat condit on event that have probabl 0 accord
to some but not all of the measur in p di erent to see thi consid an exampl
discuss by de campo and moral suppos a coin is known to be either doublehead or
doubletail and is toss twice thi can be repres by p f 0 1 g where 0 hh
1 and 0 ht 0 th 0 tt 0 while 1 tt 1 and 1 ht 1 th 1 hh 0
let x1 and x2 be the random variabl repres the outcom of the rst and second
coin toss respect clearli there is a function depend between x1 and x2 but
it is easi to check that x1 and x2 are type1 independ with respect to p moreov
noninteract hold ni plx1 i x2 j hold for i j 2 fh tg on the other hand
iplp x1 x2 doe not hold for exampl fx1 h1 0 while fx1 hjx2 h1 9
the di erenc between noninteract ie type1 independ and the de nition of
independ use in thi paper in the context of set of probabl measur can be summar as follow u and v do not interact with respect to p if u and v are independ
9 as peter walley privat commun 2000 point out thi exampl is somewhat mislead the
de nition of independ with respect to plp produc the same counterintuit behavior as type1
independ if the probabl are modi ed slightli so as to make them posit ie when there is
almost function depend between the two variabl for exampl suppos that the coin in the
exampl is known to either land head with probabl 99 or 01 rather than 1 and 0 as in the exampl
let 00 and 01 be the obviou modi cation of 0 and 1 requir to repres thi situat and let
0 00 01 it is easi to check that x1 and x2 continu to be type1 independ and noninteract
continu to hold but now ipl x1 x2 also hold the real problem is that thi represent of
uncertainti doe not enabl learn

respect to p if 1 u and v are independ for all measur 2 p such that u 0 and
v 0 and 2 u 0 i v 0 for all 2 p the de nition of independ use
here is thu more restrict it doe not ignor the measur that give u or v probabl 0
when determin independ the di erenc between the two approach is illustr
in the exampl in the previou paragraph
as the variant of the exampl consid in footnot 9 show though neither de nition
can complet claim to repres the intuit that if u is independ of v then learn
u give no inform about v if the coin in the exampl is known to land head with
probabl either 99 or 01 then see the rst coin toss land head certainli seem to
give inform about the second coin toss even though both de nition would declar
the event independ howev the de nition of independ use here doe have the
advantag of lead to an algebra cp which mean as is shown in the next section that
use it lead to a represent of set of probabl measur that can be repres as
a bayesian network
5 bayesian network
throughout thi section i assum that we start with a set w of possibl world character
by a set x fx1 xn g of n binari random variabl that is a world in w is a tupl
x1 xn with xi 2 f0 1g and xi x1 xn xi that is the valu of xi in world
w x1 xn wi10 the goal of thi section is to show that mani of the tool of
bayesian network technolog can be appli in thi set the proof of the main result
all proceed in essenti the same spirit as wellknown result for probabilist bayesian
network see geiger pearl 1988 geiger et al 1990 verma 1986
51 qualit bayesian network
as usual a qualit bayesian network over x is a dag whose node are label by
variabl in x the standard notion of a bayesian network repres a probabl
measur pearl 1988 can be gener in the obviou way to plausibl
de nition 51 given a qualit bayesian network g let pargx be the parent of the
random variabl x in g let desg x be all the descend of x that is x and all those
node y such that x is an ancestor of y let ndg x the nondescend of x consist
of x desg x note that all ancestor of x are nondescend of x the bayesian
network g is compat with the cp w f f 0 pl or just compat with pl if the other
compon of the cp are clear from context if iplrv x ndg x jparx that is if x is
condit independ of it nondescend given it parent for all x 2 x
there is a standard way of construct a bayesian network that repres a probabl measur pearl 1988 i brie y review the construct here sinc it work without
chang for an algebra cpm given an algebra cpm pl let y1 yn be a permut of the random variabl in x construct a qualit bayesian network gplhy1 y i

algebra cpm determin by a quantit bayesian network as state thi question is
somewhat undetermin the number in a quantit network do not say what and
ought to be for the algebra cpm
a reason way to make the question more interest is the follow recal that
for the purpos of thi section i have taken w to consist of the 2n world character by
the n binari random variabl in x let pld consist of all standard cpss of the form
w f f 0 pl where f 2w so that all subset of w are measur the rang of pl is

0 1 0 1 in the case of probabl there is no need to make thi requir explicit
howev it is necessari for other represent of uncertainti
the follow result show that as the name suggest there is a uniqu cpm that
repres a represent quantit bayesian network
theorem 56 if g f is d represent then there is a uniqu cpm pl 2
pld such that g f repres pl
53 dsepar
just as in the case of probabl condit independ can be read o the bayesian
network use the criterion of dsepar pearl 1988 recal that a set x of node
in g v e is dsepar from a set y of node by a set z of node in g written
dsep g x yjz if for everi x 2 x y 2 y and a trail from x to y that is a sequenc
x0 xk of node in g such that x0 x xk y and either xi xi1 or xi1 xi
is a direct edg in g and a node xi on the trail with 0 i k such that either
a xi 2 z and there is an arrow lead into xi and an arrow lead out ie either
xi 1 xi xi xi1 2 e or xi xi 1 xi1 xi 2 e
b xi 2 z and xi is a tailtotail node ie xi xi 1 xi xi1 2 e
c xi is a head to head node ie xi 1 xi xi1 xi 2 e and neither xi nor ani
of it descend are in z
let gpl consist of all statement of the form iplrv x ndg x jparg x let pld
be an arbitrari collect of cpss of the form w f f 0 pl where all compon other
than pl are xed and the plausibl measur pl all have the same rang d of plausibl

2 iplrv x yjz is provabl from cirv14 and gpl
378
condit plausibl measur and bayesian network
3 iplrv x yjz hold for everi plausibl measur in pld compat with g
the implic from 1 to 2 is prove in geiger et al 1990 verma 1986
theorem 57 geiger et al 1990 verma 1986 if dsep gx yjz then iplrv x yjz is
provabl from cirv14 and gpl
it is immedi from theorem 45 that the implic from 2 to 3 hold for algebra
cpm
corollari 58 if iplrv x yjz is provabl from cirv14 and gpl then iplrv x yjz
hold for everi algebra cpm pl compat with g
final the implic from 3 to 1 for probabl measur is prove in geiger pearl
1988 geiger et al 1990 here i gener the proof to algebra plausibl measur
notic that to prove the implic from 3 to 1 it su ce to show that if x is not dsepar from y by z in g then there is a plausibl measur pl 2 pld such that
iplrv x y jz doe not hold to guarante that such a plausibl measur exist in pld
we have to ensur that there are enough plausibl measur in pld in the follow
technic sens
de nition 59 a bncompat domain d is rich if there exist d d0 2 d such
that 1 d d0 2 d 2 d d0 and 3 if x x1 xk where each xi is either
d or d0 and k n then d x x d d0 x and x d0 are all in d intuit d
contain all product involv d and d0 of length at most n
all the domain for the cpss we have consid are easili seen to be rich
theorem 510 suppos that plausibl measur in pld take valu in a rich bncompat domain then if iplrv x yjz hold for everi plausibl measur in pld
compat with g then dsep g x yjz
i remark that independ and dsepar for variou approach to repres set
of probabl measur use bayesian network are discuss by cozman 2000b 2000a
howev the technic detail are quit di erent from the approach taken here
6 conclus
i have consid a gener notion of condit plausibl that gener all other standard notion of condit in the literatur and examin variou requir that
could be impos on condit plausibl one set of requir those that lead to
algebra cpss wa shown to su ce for the construct of bayesian network further
assum that the rang d of the plausibl measur is a bncompat domain su ce
for all the more quantit properti of bayesian network to hold and for dsepar
to character the independ it should also be clear that standard construct like
belief propag in bayesian network pearl 1988 can also be appli to algebra cpss
with rang that are bncompat sinc they typic use onli basic properti of condit addit and multipl all of which hold in bncompat domain use
379
halpern
and in particular these result appli to set to probabl measur provid that
they are appropri repres as plausibl measur the particular represent
of set of probabl measur advoc in thi paper wa also shown to have a number of
other attract properti
the result of thi paper show that alg14 are su cient condit for repres
a measur of uncertainti that is accept as a bayesian network they may not be
necessari it would be interest to see if other natur condit also su ce similarli i
have focus onli on accept cpss that is one that satisfi acc14 acc3 and acc4 are
nontrivi condit it would be of interest to see to what extent they could be weaken
while still be abl to prove result in the spirit of thi paper i leav these question to
futur research
appendix a proof
in thi section i give the proof of theorem 45 56 and 510 i repeat the statement of
the result for the conveni of the reader
lemma a1 suppos that w f f 0 pl is a cp a1 an is a partit of w x a1 an 2

proof use an easi induct argument it follow from alg1 that
plx jy ni1 plx ai jy
if ai y 2 f 0 then it follow from acc4 that plai jy thu by cpl3 plx ai jy
use lemma 33 it follow that
plx jy fia y 2f 0 g plx ai jy

as desir
theorem 45 cirv14 hold for all algebra cpss
proof cirv1 is immedi from the fact that independ is symmetr
for cirv2 suppos that iplrv x y y0 jz we must show iplrv x yjz that is we
must show that ipl x x y yjz z for all x y and z thi requir show two
thing
0 then plx a y pla y plx a y by alg2 thu the term

thu we have 4a
for 4b suppos that x x z z 2 f 0 there are now two case to consid if
pli yjx x z z 6 then by acc4 x x y y z z 2 f 0 moreov by

pli y y0 y0 jz z
as desir
now if pli yjx x z z then by cpl3 it follow that pli y

appli cpl3 we get that pli y y0 y0 jz z thu again 4b hold
theorem 56 if g f is d represent then there is a uniqu cpm pl 2
pld such that g f repres pl
proof given g f suppos without loss of gener that x hx1 xn i is a topo
logic sort of the node in g i now de ne the plausibl measur pl determin by g f
i start by de ning plgf on set of the form x x
it easili follow from alg2 that if pl 2 pld and plx1 x1 xn 1 xn 1 6
then
plx x plxn xn jx1 x1 xn 1 xn 1
plxn 1 xn 1 jx1 x1 xn 2 xn 2

plx2 x2 jx1 x1 plx1 x1
thu an algebra plausibl measur sati es an analogu of the chain rule for probabl
sinc in d is assum to be associ no parenthes are requir here howev even
without thi assumpt it follow easili from alg2 that is in fact associ on tupl
a b c of the form plu1 ju2 plu2 ju3 plu3 ju4 where u1 u2 u3 u4 which are
the onli type of tupl that aris in 11 associ will be more of an issu below
if pl is compat with g then in fact
plx x plxn xn j x 2par x xj xj
plxn 1 xn 1 j x 2par x 1 xj xj
12
x1 x1
if parg xk then plxk xk jx 2par x xj xj is just taken to be plxk xk
it is clear from 12 that plgf x x must be dx gx
dx1 gx
note that everi subset of w can be written as a disjoint union of event of the form
x x thu if u 2 f de ne
plgf u fxxx u gdx gx
dx1 gx
for condit plausibl suppos that plgf v 6 so that v 2 f 0 let
fx1 xk g fx x x v g it follow easili from bn6 bn7 r1 and r2 that
plgf x x1 plgf x xk 2 d thu by bn8 if x x v then

where plgf jv is taken to be note for futur refer that it follow from bn5
that plgf u jv plgf v 2 d and
plgf u jv plgf v plgf u v
13
thi complet the de nition of plgf it remain to check that it is an algebra cpm
that is repres by g f thu we must check that alg14 and cpl14 hold alg1
is immedi from the de nition and bn1 and bn2 bn2 is necessari for the case that
one of the disjoint set is empti alg3 is immedi from bn3 and alg4 is immedi
from bn4 for alg2 note that if plgf v 6 and plgf v 0 6 then by 13
plgf u v jv 0 plgf v 0 plgf u v v 0 and
plgf u jv v 0 plgf v jv 0 plgf v 0

by 13 plgf w jv plgf v plgf v sinc plgf v plgf v by
bn2 it follow from bn4 that plgf w jv cpl3 follow readili from the de nition
togeth with bn1 bn6 and bn7 cpl4 also follow by de nition
next we must show that g f repres plgf the rst step is to show that
plgf x xjparg x z dx xjpar x z note that by 13
plgf x xjparg x z plgf parg x z plgf x x parg x z
by de nition
plgf x x parg x z fxxx0 x xpar x yg plgf x x0
each term in the sum on the right is the product of term inde the sum is over all
possibl product that includ dx yjpar x z as one of the term and a term dy yjpar y z0
for each y 2 parg x where y is the compon of z correspond to y by use bn1
bn3 r1 and r2 it is not hard to show that
plgf x y parg x z
fxx0 x xpar x y plgf x x0
14
dx xjpar z plgf parg x z
it now follow from bn4 that plgf x xjparg x z dx xjpar x z
to show that plgf x xjndg x y parg x z dx xjpar x z it su ce

for then the result follow by bn5 15 can be shown much like 14 but now the commut of bn1 is essenti that is the express for plgf x x ndg x
y parg x z and dx xjpar x z plgf ndg x y parg x z involv
the same term but not necessarili in the same order with commut they can be

theorem 510 suppos that d is a rich bncompat domain then if iplrv x yjz
hold for everi plausibl measur in pld compat with g then dsep g x yjz
proof suppos that x is not dsepar from y by z in g then there is some x 2 x
and y 2 y such that x is not dsepar from y by z in g i construct a cpm in
pl 2 pld such that iplrv x y jz doe not hold use the techniqu of geiger et al
1990
as shown in geiger et al 1990 lemma 9 if x is not dsepar from y in g there
exist a subgraph g0 of g such that
1 g0 includ all the node in g but onli a subset of the edg in g
2 x is not dsepar from y by z in g0
3 the edg e 0 in g0 consist onli of those speci ed below
a a trail q from x to y
b for everi headtohead node xi on the trail q there is a direct path pi in g0 to
a node in z moreov the path pi do not share ani node and the onli node
that pi share with q is xi
note that everi node in g0 ha either 0 1 or 2 parent in g0 let g0 f be a quantit
bayesian network such that for each node in x in g0 with no parent in g0 the cpt f x
is such that dx 0 d and dx 1 d0 if a node x in g0 ha one parent say x 0 then the
cpt f x is such that dx ijx 0 j is if i j and if i 6 j final if x ha two parent
say x 0 and x 00 the cpt f x is such that dx kjx 0 ix 00 k is if k i j mod2 and is
otherwis sinc d d0 and bn2 guarante that the construct sati es
r1 the rich of d guarante that r2 hold by theorem 56 there is a uniqu
plausibl measur in pl 2 pld that is repres by g0 f it is easi to check that
pl is compat with g as well there are three case to consid
suppos that x ha no parent in g0 then it is easi to see that iplrv x yjz for all
y and z and in particular if y ndgx and z pargx
suppos that x ha one parent in g0 say x 0 then it is easi to see that iplrv x yjz
hold for all y and z such that x 0 2 z sinc x 0 is a parent of x in g again
iplrv x ndg x jparg x must hold
final if x ha two parent in g0 say x 0 and x 00 then it is easi to see that
iplrv x yjz hold for all y and z such that fx 0 x 00 g z sinc x 0 and x 00 are
parent of x in g again iplrv x ndg x jparg x must hold
