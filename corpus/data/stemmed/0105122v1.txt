we discuss some aspect of forward jet product as a signatur
for small x physic at thera energi

introduct
the evolut of the parton densiti at small x is a veri rich but complic
issu the steep rise of the structur function f2 at small x is explain by the
presenc of a huge gluon number densiti the pure dglap 1 2 3 4 evolut
equat meant to describ the evolut of the parton densiti as a function of
q2 are abl to reproduc the rise of f2 provid the input start distribut
are chosen properli

of success branch in the gluon chain and k2 is virtual of the tchannel
gluon with k2 kt2 in dglap the k2 depend of all emiss in the gluon
chain are simplifi by the observ that at not too small x the domin part
to the cross section come from the region of phase space where k2 is veri small
howev if x or z becom veri small the collinear small kt2 approxim of

wherea at hera energi s 300 gev the total cross section of deep
inelast scatter can be reason well describ with the dglap evolut

clear deviat from a pure dglap scenario
the cross section at low x and larg q2 for a high et2 jet in the proton
direct a forward jet ha been advoc as a particularli sensit measur of small x parton dynam 12 13 if the forward jet ha larg energi
xjet ejet eproton x the evolut from xjet to small x can be studi
when et2 q2 there is no room for q2 evolut left and the dglap formal
predict a rather small cross section in contrast to the bfklccfm formal
which describ the evolut also in x measur perform at hera 14 15
show that the predict from the naiv dglap formal lie a factor 2 below
the data wherea the data can be describ by ccfm evolut equat 16

the effect of new small x parton dynam is most clearli seen if the contribut
from typic dglap dynam is suppress the forward jet product in deep
inelast scatter at small valu of x is one exampl of such a process howev
the kinemat need to be investig further typic event select criteria at

the rang in x is typic 103 x 102 the evolut take place from
the larg xjet down to the small x with a typic rang at hera energi of

instead of a fix order calcul one would requir at least 2 or more gluon

figur 2 the valu of the split variabl z for event satisfi the forward jet criteria with 7 at hera energi
gluon emiss between 103 x 101 one can assum that each gluon carri
the same energi then the rang of x 001 result in z 02 which is far
from be in the veri small z region where the bfkl or ccfm approxim
treat onli the 1z term in the gluon split function are expect to be
appropri in fig 2 we show the valu of the split variabl z in event
satisfi the forward jet criteria at hera energi obtain from the mont carlo
gener cascad 16 sinc the valu of the split variabl z are inde in
the larg z region the major ha z 01 it is question whether the bfkl
or ccfm evolut equat includ onli the 1z term of the gluon split
function are alreadi applic wherea the measur at hera stop at
x 103 the avail phase space at thera is enlarg by a factor of 10
therefor the gluon along the chain will presum have smaller z valu and
the usag of the small x evolut equat might be more justifi in fig 3 we
show the z valu obtain from event satisfi the forward jet select criteria
at thera energi s 959 gev compar with the one at hera energi

becom flat at small z at thera energi and that the small z valu are no

thera energi the dash line correspond to hera energi
longer suppress as in the hera kinemat region thi clearli show that the
applic of small x evolut equat at thera energi are justifi and
unavoid although the sensit to the treatment of larg z split doe
not complet go away
at hera the forward jet cross section could be reason well describ
by includ a resolv virtual photon contribut becaus the phase space for
small z emiss at hera energi wa rel small the situat chang at
5
thera energi the phase space for small z emiss is larger and effect from
small x evolut becom more visibl in fig 4 the cross section for forward jet
product is shown as a function of x for standard dglap predict dot includ in addit a contribut from resolv virtual photon dasheddot
and the ccfm predict dash for comparison the predict from ariadn 171 is shown which implement a semiclass soft radiat model in
a dipol cascad and which current give the best overal descript of smallx hera data sinc the the avail phase space at thera is enlarg by
a factor of 10 the differ between the standard dglapbas calcul
and the ccfm calcul is increas moreov at thera the ccfm approach predict a larger cross section than the model with resolv virtual photon
contribut ad and smaller cross section than ariadn while all three
model give compar result at hera thi give a uniqu opportun not
onli to distinguish between the differ approach but also to studi detail of
the qcd cascad in a regim where the new smallx evolut equat should
be appropri

in fig 5 the forward jet cross section is shown for differ minim jet angl
cut on the experiment side thi requir complet accept both in the
electron and proton direct down to the lowest possibl angl from the size of
the cross section ddx one would like to reach at least 3 for the forward jet
measur but there are other reason to ask even for 1 on the other
hand the luminos need for such measur are moder so that thi
question can be settl within one year of run at thera

conclus
hera ha conclus shown the need to go beyond the standard dglap evolut equat in order to explain the data on smallx final state the reach
in x is howev not quit enough to realli studi detail of the smallx evolut
to be abl to distinguish between differ approach such as the ccfm evolut resolv virtual photon and the dipol cascad model with the increas
kinemat region avail at thera thi will becom possibl the steepli
rise cross section as x get smaller mean that such measur can be done
even with moder luminos on the other hand the demand on the forward
coverag of the detector is more critic ideal it should be possibl to measur
jet down to an angl of 1
onc a good understand of the smallx evolut is obtain it should be
possibl to use the underli k factor theorem in bfklccfm where
observ are describ in term of processdepend offshel matrix element
and univers unintegr parton densiti to make firm predict of ani other
smallx measur just as normal dglap parton densiti and matrix element
are use today at larg q2 thera will be the onli place where these unintegr parton densiti can be measur
