abstract
present here is the mathemat model describ the phenomenon of shock
wave the underli concept is base on the timespac model of wave propag
keyword shock wave wave equat

concept behind the phenomenon
the first assert is that a wave is caus by the differ between energi
valu at some point and averag energi valu coin as an energi level in the
neighborhood of thi point that differ is call energi discrep at thi point
which is wavili propag both in space and in time besid that a wave travel with a
finit speed see 1
the second assert is that addit to wavi propag the energi
discrep spread directli as well but direct spread deceler quickli wherea
wave may propag on a big distanc
the conclus is that when speed of direct spread of energi discrep
exce the speed of wave propag the wave acquir an addit energi while
travel in space and we have to appli the wave attenu as well
therefor an accumul of energi discrep by travel wave creat the
phenomenon which receiv a name of shock wave

model descript
here i describ the onedimension case
i assum that at time t t 0 in point x x 0 we have a posit energi
discrep
0 t 0 x 0 0

accord to 1 thi discrep propag wavili in space with a finit speed
c 0 while travel the wave attenu therefor at time t t1 t 0 when a
discrep reach the point x x1 where
x x0 t1 t 0 c x 0
it will have the amplitud
x1
0 t1 x1 0 t 0 x 0
x dx t

x0
where x 0 repres the loss of energi discrep at point x
x 0 x1
on the other hand energi discrep spread directli in interv
x0 x 2
quickli attenu i assum that the energi discrep spread with a speed
v c 0
thu the discrep accumul and the accumul valu is
x
x dx
x xx02
x dx

for x x 2

for x x 2
where x 0 is a posit monoton decreas function
henc the overal energi discrep at time t t1 in point x x1 where it
hold x0 x1 x 2 is
t1 x1 0 t 0 x 0
x1
x x dx

x0
therefor when x x for x
x 0 x1 it hold the inequ
t1 x1 0 t 0 x0
and the energi discrep grow for the travel wave
