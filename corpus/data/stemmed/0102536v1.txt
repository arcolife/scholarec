the effect of the electronelectron cusp on the converg of configur interact ci wave
function is examin by analog with the pseudopotenti approach for electronion interact
an effect electronelectron interact is develop which close reproduc the scatter of
the coulomb interact but is smooth and finit at zero electronelectron separ the exact
manyelectron wave function for thi smooth effect interact ha no cusp at zero electronelectron separ we perform ci and quantum mont carlo calcul for he and be atom
both with the coulomb electronelectron interact and with the smooth effect electronelectron
interact we find that converg of the ci expans of the wave function for the smooth
electronelectron interact is not significantli improv compar with that for the diverg
coulomb interact for energi differ on the order of 1 mhartre thi show that contrari to
popular belief descript of the electronelectron cusp is not a limit factor to within chemic
accuraci for ci calcul
attribut to their correct descript of the shortrang
part of the interact
a complet differ point of view taken by gilbert
in 1963 15 is that the difficulti of ci wave function in
describ shortrang effect of the cusp are energet
unimport and that the benefit of the explicitli correl approach is that the entir coulomb hole with a
size on the order of the atom orbit is much easier to
describ in term of interelectron coordin gilbert
suggest appear to have receiv littl attent and
the idea that smooth out the coulomb potenti and
remov the cusp altogeth will automat lead to
an improv ci converg ha been state in the literatur 169 howev no systemat studi of the effect
of the electron cusp on ci energi converg at the level
of interest for chemic accuraci 1 mhartre for total
energi have been present
in thi paper we explor whether a signific improv in the converg of the ci expans is
obtain when the true hamiltonian is replac by one
which ha a smooth and finit electronelectron interact pseudointeract at short distanc and consequ smooth eigenfunct with no cusp
surprisingli in calcul for the he and be atom
we find that remov the diverg of the coulomb
potenti at electronelectron coalesc doe not significantli reduc the length of the ci expans therebi
substanti the argument put forward by gilbert 15
that the slow converg should be attribut to difficulti in describ not the interelectron cusp but
the intermediaterang electron correl the poor
treatment of the interelectron cusp in the ci expans is
not a limit factor at the mhartre level of accuraci on
the total energi to further confirm thi result we calcul the energi within quantum mont carlo qmc for
the true electronelectron interact with accur wave
function which explicitli contain interelectron coordin and then deliber remov the shortrang cor
i introduct
the primari difficulti in solv the schroding equat for manyelectron system aris from the presenc
of the electronelectron interact which result in a
problem nonsepar in the electron coordin configur interact ci calcul use an expans
of the manybodi wave function in configur state
function csf given by spin coupl sum of determin built from singleparticl orbit one of the central difficulti for the converg of the ci expans
is thought to aris from the behaviour of the coulomb
interact at small electronelectron separ 110
the manybodi wave function must have an appropri
cusp at electron coalesc so that the infinit coulomb
interact term is exactli cancel by an opposit diverg of the kinet energi 11
it is often state in the literatur that failur of the
ci expans to reproduc the correct electron cusp ie
the shortrang part of the coulomb hole lead to a slow
converg in the energi with respect to the number
of csf 3 while thi ha been shown 25 in the
asymptot regim ie veri larg angular momentum l
and energi error of the order of 106 hartre it is not
clear that it appli in the practic regim mhartre
accuraci for multielectron system
explicit inclus of term in the interelectron distanc r12 method 124 or the use of correl gemin gaussian basi function 13 significantli improv
the converg of a ci calcul for the helium atom
the inclus of r12 term 5 yield an expans in partial
wave converg asymtot as l6 or better instead
of a slow l3 where l is the maximum angular momentum
in the expans baker et al 14 also show that use
basi function with the same analyt structur as the
true wave function depend on power and logarithm
of r12 lead to a reduc expans length the success of method explicitli includ r12 term ha been

relat term relat to the cusp keep other part
of the wave function unchang we find that the remov of the cusp ha a veri small effect on the variat energi final we demonstr that the converg behavior of the ci expans as a function of
angular momentum in the rang practic for mani applic l 6 is larg unaffect by the smooth
of the electron cusp therefor the angular momentum

the electronelectron interact and briefli present the

isol pair of electron we use with some minor modif the gener normconserv method devis by hamann 19 to gener pseudopotenti for

cowork 20 in a differ context in appendix b the

exact eigenst energi is analyz qualit use
firstord perturb theori in appendix c we defin a shortrang interelectron correl term which
can be directli relat to the replac of the diverg
coulomb interact with a smooth normconserv interact
when modifi the shortdist electronelectron
interact we wish to keep the intermedi and longrang correl properti of the manybodi eigenst unchang thi will allow us to isol systemat the effect of the shortrang cusplik behaviour in
the wave function to achiev thi our new smooth interact should ideal have electronelectron scatter
properti ident to the true interact for all energi if thi were the case all manyelectron eigenvalu
would be ident for both interact while thi ideal
cannot be exactli realiz we expect that a potenti
with the same scatter properti as the true interact over a suffici wide rang of scatter energi
will give manyelectron eigenvalu veri close to the true
one
thi goal for electronelectron scatter is analog
to the problem of electronion scatter address in the
wellestablish pseudopotenti method 17 in that approach the aim is to produc a smooth electronion potenti which reproduc the singleparticl eigenvalu
of the true system over a rang of energi and ha the
same singleparticl wave function outsid some suitabl

a desir degre of converg in the ci calcul is
achiev a full ci fci calcul can be obtain for

a ground state of the he atom
in fig 2 we show the singlet ground state energi of
the he atom calcul with a normconserv electronelectron interact vp gener as in sec ii for variou
valu of the cutoff radiu rc the valu obtain from
qmc exact calcul are shown we also plot the
energi calcul use the verf r interact the horizont line indic the exact energi e0 2903724
hartre for the true coulomb interact 26
the calcul qmc energi for vp and verf in
fig 2 are fit with polynomi expans of the form
3
it way thi condit is similar to the criterion use
in the gener of electronion pseudopotenti where
the cutoff radiu is chosen to be insid the peak of the
valenc electron densiti
also shown in fig 2 are the variat energi with
the true coulomb electronelectron interact obtain
for the he ground state by remov the electron cusp
from the accur trial wave function which wa determin by varianc minim for use in the dmc calcul as specifi in eq c1 thi trial wave function
includ consider variat freedom in the interelectron term and obtain 100 of the correl energi
as can be seen in fig 2 remov of the cusp out to radii
of 05 au caus littl degrad of the qualiti of the
energi obtain with thi wave function thu the success of interelectron term in obtain good variat
energi is not primarili due to their descript of the
shortrang cusp behaviour
thi trend is further born out when we look at
the converg of partial ci expans within a given
singleparticl basi set for the mcci method the ci
calcul were perform with the correl consist polar valenc doublezeta ccpvdz triplezeta
ccpvtz quadruplezeta ccpvqz and quintuplezeta ccpv5z basi set of dun 27 with the electron interact vp for variou valu of rc all four
basi set show similar behaviour and we present onli
the ccpvqz result in detail tabl i show the correl energi obtain as a function of cutoff radiu rc for
variou valu of the expans coeffici threshold cmin
the full ci result is obtain when cmin 00 for larger
valu of the cutoff radiu rc upper row of tabl the
total correl energi is smaller as the variat of the
interact vp becom smaller around the typic separ distanc of the electron howev the fraction of
the correl energi which is recov at a given ci
threshold level cmin depend littl on the valu of rc
fig 3 show the number of csf in the ci expans as a function of cutoff radiu rc for variou valu
of the expans coeffici threshold cmin for valu of
cmin 3 102 one is quickli reduc to a few csf
and final to the hartreefock solut as with the correl energi for a given threshold cmin the number
of csf show rel littl chang for valu of rc between 0 and 095 again it is worth bear in mind that
the typic electronelectron separ is 1 au and that
a cutoff radiu rc 095 repres a veri smooth interact thu remov of electron cusp doe not result
in a signific reduct in the number of contribut
configur in the ci expans
we next demonstr that remov of the electron cusp
doe not significantli chang the converg properti

in thi paper we have directli explor the effect
of the electron cusp on the converg of the energi for ci wave function to do so we introduc
a fictiti electronelectron interact which unlik
the true coulomb potenti doe not diverg at electron coalesc and therefor ha manybodi eigenfunct which are smooth there the smooth potenti is obtain by a method analog to the wellestablish treatment of electronion interact with

rang cusp rather the improv in converg at
the mhartre level must be understood in term of a
better descript of mediumrang correl when express in interelectron coordin thi fact must be
consid when develop theoret treatment of the

particl are involv in the gener of the electronelectron pseudointeract so that we do not need to includ screen potenti ii becaus we are solv the

the mass of the electron is replac by the reduc mass
for the twoelectron system in hartre atom unit the

in the normconserv pseudopotenti approach differ scatter potenti are often gener for differ valu of the angular momentum l the full manybodi wave function is antisymmetr with respect to exchang of ani two electron thu if the two electron
have parallel spin the orbit part of the wave function
must have odd pariti and the allow angular momentum
l must be odd thu the domin parallelspin scatter ha l 1 for singlet antiparallel scatter
the orbit part is symmetr and l must be even with
domin allow angular momentum l 0 follow
the usual pseudopotenti approach we might then expect to gener a parallelspin scatter potenti use
l 1 and an antiparallelspin scatter potenti use
l 0 in practic we find that the l 0 potenti give
good scatter for both angular momenta and the use
of separ parallel and antiparallelspin potenti is
unnecessari
sinc l is posit the wave function will oscil for
larg r and if a node occur for r r the invers of the schroding equat will fail thu the joint
requir that rc be suffici larg to produc a
smooth pseudointeract and that r 25rc effect limit the maximum refer energi l at which
the pseudointeract construct is possibl
we find that the pseudointeract is transfer ie
ha veri similar scatter strength to the true interact for energi over a wide rang about the refer
energi l as found previous for electronion pseudopotenti in particular we find that transfer is best
for energi less than the refer energi at which the
pseudopotenti wa gener thi would suggest that
the best refer energi to use is the largest energi

in the gener of the normconserv potenti discuss in appendix a we obtain a pseudo wave function up r which is a solut to the radial schroding
equat at the scatter energi l for the pseudointeract and the wave function ul r which is the
correspond solut for the true coulomb interact
the ratio jsr ul up of these two function ha the
correct electron cusp ie logarithm deriv of 14
