introduct it is alway a good practic to provid the physic content of an
analyt result the follow algebra inequ lend itself well to thi purpos
for ani finit sequenc of real number r1 r2 rn we have

a standard proof is given in 1 an altern proof follow from the isoperimetr

where a is the surfac area and v the volum of ani threedimension bodi set

the area a n

a bubbl proof we give yet anoth proof now use element of surfac tension
theori and ideal ga law to the format and coalesc of bubbl thi proof
found in 2 run as follow
accord to a wellknown result in surfac tension theori when a spheric bubbl
of radiu r is form in the air there is a differ of pressur between the insid
and the outsid of the surfac film given by
p p0

where p0 is the extern atmospher pressur on the surfac film of the bubbl p
is the intern pressur and t is the surfac tension that maintain the bubbl 3

now suppos that all n bubbl come close enough to be drawn togeth by surfac
tension and combin to form a singl spheric bubbl of radiu r and intern
pressur p also obey eq 2 when thi happen the product of the intern
pressur p and the volum v of the result bubbl form by the coalesc of

now if the total amount of air in the bubbl doe not chang the surfac area of
the result bubbl form by the coalesc of the bubbl is alway smaller than
the sum of the surfac area of the individu bubbl befor coalesc thu

sinc the potenti energi of a bubbl is proport to it surfac area 7 is
a physic condit that the surfac energi of the system is minim after the
coalesc
it follow from 7 and the fact that p0 and t are posit constant that the
left hand side of equat 6 satisfi

the equal which impli conserv of volum hold when the excess pressur
in the bubbl film is much less the atmospher pressur combin 7 and 8
yield the inequ 1 which is also valid for neg number
acknowledg ob would like to thank dr joel hass for point out the isoperimetr proof of 1 and fapesp for support under grant 97144302
