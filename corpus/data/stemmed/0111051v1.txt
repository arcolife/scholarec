summari talk intern confer of flavor physic icfp 2001 zhang
jiaji hunan china may june 2001
for me it is a pleasur to give the summari talk at thi confer on flavor
physic held near one of the most spectacular place on our planet the natur
wonder of wulingyan in the hunan provinc of china in the natur park we
have seen a veri spectacular abund of form and structur wulingyuan
prove onc again that natur prefer complex instead of simplic onc
it is given the choic the german philosoph leibniz suggest more than
300 year ago that we live in the best of all possibl world i doubt whether
thi is true but certainli he did not mean that we live in the simplest of all
possibl world it is not the world of konfuziu follow rigid law and
simpl structur but rather the world of laots full of complex a world
in the etern swing between yin and yang
the topic of thi confer the physic of flavor fit veri well into these
surround in all of particl physic the physic of flavor stick out as the
field which ha the highest complex and the richest phenomenolog inde
the flavor of particl physic can be seen most clearli by look at the physic
of flavor with all it phenomena rang from the spectra of heavi meson and
baryon from particleantiparticl oscil from cp violat etc up to
exot pheonomena like neutrino oscil
flavor physic is an area which ha emerg as an independ field of
high energi physic onli after the standard model of today had come up
in it first contur shortli after the begin of the 70i at that time
it becam appar that quark carri color and the color forc is of crucial
import for the understand of the strong interact phenomena thu
the need to distinguish between the color index and the index describ the
variou type of quark u d s suddenli wa in the air at least at caltech
which wa about the onli place where such subtleti were discuss at that
time for my own privat use i denot the variou quark as quark type

a notat i still use today in the german languag onc gellmann and i
were drive to a lunch restaur in pasadena and pass by a baskin and
robin icecream place advertis 32 differ flavor murray suddenli came
up with the propos to use the name flavor i did not like thi propos
at the begin translat it into german where it mean geschmack
an express one could hardli use for the descript of a subatom particl
soon afterward howev i went along with it expeci after realiz that
in other languag the translat of flavor give quit meaning result
for exampl in italian the word il sapor use e g in il sapor del vino
could veri well be use to distinguish the variou degre of freedom of the
quark
compar to the present time the flavor physic in those day wa rather
poor onli three flavor i e u d s were known and the basic paramet
of flavor physic were the three quark mass and the cabibbo angl cp
violat wa consid to be a peculiar phenomenon not intrins relat
to the flavor mix
today we see the sharp contur of the standard model1 in front of us like
the contur of the wulingyan mountain seen from the golden whip stream
the physic of flavor is at the same time the physic of the multitud of the
free paramet of the theori even if we disregard possibl neutrino mass
the minim number of paramet is 18 among them the six mass of the
quark the three lepton mass and four flavor mix paramet especi
those 13 paramet are in the focu of flavor physic in the standard model
they aris in a way which can hardli be consid satisfactori even on low
standard they appear as the result of a direct coupl of the fermion to
the higg field a formal devic without ani predict power as far as those
paramet are concern
in my view thi mechan of fermion mass gener is the least attract corner of the standard model and it is quit like that thi is the corner
where the model might deviat from realiti furthermor it might well be that
the higg particl respons for the gener of mass for the w and the
zboson doe not coupl to the bquark with a strength proport to mb
as expect in the standard model in which case the higg particl would
not decay predominantli into a bbsystem but into other particl e g into
two gluon or into see e g ref 2
more than a year ago we have enter the new millenium with a rather
bizarr spectrum of the lepton and quark mass which extend in the absenc
of neutrino mass from about 05 mev electron mass to about 175000 mev
tmass stretch over almost six order of magnitud on a logarithm
scale the quark mass are nearli on straight line if plot as function of

the hierarchi exhibit by the mass spectrum is impress moreov
about 97 of the mass is provid by the tmass the tquark is the onli

thu far thi factor 2 which look like a clebschgordon coeffici ha
not been understood it might of cours simpli be an accid
nevertheless the leptonquark mass spectrum exhibit simpl featur which
ask for a deeper understand beyond the rather shallow interpret given
within the standard model slightli more than 100 year ago the energi spectra observ e g for the hydrogen atom found their theoret explan
within quantum theori one can expect that in a similar way the fermion
mass spectrum is a clear sign that there is physic activ beyond the frontier
line drawn by the standard model presum not much below the present
explor surfac
in thi talk i shall not summar the confer by go in more detail
through the mani topic discuss at the confer let me just list the main
theme after we were remind by wolfenstein that cp violat is now
with us for 36 year we heard in the talk of roo and sagawa the news about
the bdecay measur from babar and bell the result for sin2 have
still larg error but they provid clear sign that cp is violat also in the
bsystem for the first time cp violat ha been observ outsid the k
system further result for bdecay came in from cleo as report by gao
in the standard model cp violat aris as a byproduct of flavor mix
but ani extens of the model e g toward supersymmetr theori ha
it new sourc of cp violat as discuss by chang
flavor physic cannot be seen disjointli from other part of particl physic
in particular from qcd or from extens of the standard model toward a
deeper understand of graviti see the talk of liu and li on chiral symmetri
and of kim on the mysteri surround the cosmolog constant
3
as we heard in the talk of koepk and hsiung direct cp violat which
is expect in the standard model seem to be establish both at cern
and at fnal although the violat in the us is larger than in europ the
chairman of thi confer yueliang wu describ in detail the present
theoret prictur which seem to suggest that the true valu for direct
cp violat is about in the middl between the fnal and cern result
cp violat ha not been observ thu far for baryon thi might chang
in the futur as point out by valencia in hi talk on hyperon decay
besid cp violat there are mani other featur to be studi in the
physic of charm and bflavor particl see the review by kutschk on
the fnal result of lista on babar and of antilogu on the result from
delphi
the decay of bmeson provid us with a beauti test ground to
studi the interplay between qcd and flavor dynam thi interplay wa
discuss in the talk of cheng chiu and lu
although flavor physic is the corner of the standard model which is veri
close to the experi it is not immun with respect to extrapol of
the standard model thu far the experi have not provid a direct hint
to where the exit road which take us beyond the standard model is leav
but thi could chang soon as discuss by ali and masiero with respect to
the exit toward supersymmetri and by ng with respect to the path lead
to the jungl of extra dimens
new result from be were discuss by liu the present situat at
lep concern the still hidden higg particl wa outlin by jin yuan
describ the interplay between the physic of the tquark and of the higg
particl the futur of the tquark physic from the tevatron to the lhc
and lc wa discuss by yeh
dure the second half of the nineti a new field of flavor physic ha
open it door the field of lepton flavor mix most notabl seen in the
progress which wa made in the studi of neutrino oscil one should be
remind that neutrino oscil were first discuss by pontecorvo about
0 oscil thu they came up
40 year ago in connect with the k 0 k
in close contact with the flavor physic of quark we hear from kaneyuki
about the impress progress made in kamioka neutrino oscil seem
to be firmli establish although mani detail in particular the absolut
0
magnitud of the neutrino mass are still unknown like in the k 0 k
system we know the mass split among the mass eigenst much better
than the mass themselv
presum the onli way to find out more about the absolut magnitud of the neutrino mass in the laboratori is to studi the doubl decay
4
unfortun we could not hear about the futur plan in thi field sinc
professor klapdorkleingrothau could not come of cours doubl decay
is onli feasabl as a tool to investig the neutrino mass matrix if neutrino
are either pure majorana particl or mixtur of dirac and majorana state
in case of massiv dirac state there would be no effect due to the lepton
number conserv
in the past neutrino physic wa a part of high energi physic in which
neutrino were use as tool to studi the structur of nuclear matter like the
quark structur function of the nucleon now the focu ha chang the
neutrino themselv are the subject of investig it might well be that
the new insight obtain in thi field allow us to find import inform
about the dynam insid the lepton sector i do not have to stress how
import it would be to confirm the result about neutrino mix obtain
in studi the solar and atmospher neutrino by laboratori measur
longley discuss thi in connect to the mino project in the us suzuki in
connect to the kamland projekt in japan
neutrino are special elementari object in the sens that they are electr neutral thu the dynam of the neutrino can easili be influenc
by phenomena beyond the standard model e g by mix with state which
have no resid permit within the framework of the standard model unifi
gaug theori base on the gaug group so10 are good exampl for thi
phenomenon
it is wellknown that within a theori base on so103 one is abl to
describ a nontrivi mass and mix pattern for the neutrino moreov
the simplest scheme for the break of the symmetri suggest simpl relat
between the mass of the quark and the lepton in particular between the
mass of the charg lepton and the downtyp quarks4
furthermor the seesaw mechan to gener the neutrino mass can
easili be implement in the so10framework it connect the flavor mix in the quark sector typic describ by small mix angl and in
the lepton sector howev thi connect can onli be made if someth
is known about the mass and mix pattern of the righthand massiv majorana partner of the observ neutrino a larg mix between the light
neutrino is possibl if the structur of the mass matrix for the righthand
majorana state is similar to the massmatric of the quark and charg
leptons5
recent much interest ha been devot to the studi of addit larg
dimensions6 i e dimens which go beyond the minkowski 31
structur they are possibl provid all field of the standard model propag onli in the fourdimension subspac but field which are allow with
5
respect to the sm gaug group in particular graviton and righthand neutrino are singlet to propag in a larger spacetim manifold departur
from the inversesquar law of newton are expect in thi case but have
not been seen down to the submillimet scale nevertheless if such extra
dimens are there the fundament energi scale associ with graviti
will not be the planck scale of about 1019 gev but could be much lower in
particular for one extra dimens the scale is expect to be about 108 gev
in which case neutrino physic is like to be the onli possibl to find out
someth about the extra dimens as discuss by lam a righthand
neutrino would be deriv from a 5dimension dirac field and it would act
like a steril neutrino or a tower of steril neutrino mix with the ordinari
neutrino the oscil pattern of the observ neutrino can be quit differ to the one of the extend standard model with onli three massiv
neutrino one featur of those model is that a consider amount of the
activ neutrino flux is dispers into steril neutrino in the case of e and
neutrino there are good limit for such an effect and no dispers is seen
thu far howev no limit exist for the neutrino in the forese futur
the experimentalist will provid us with enough data to set rather stringent
limit on a possibl divers of neutrino flux into the dark corner of extra
dimens and thi will at the same time provid strong constraint on the
physic of extra dimens less like but certainli possibl is their actual discoveri in look through the neutrino gla beyond the realm of our
fourdimension world
the phenomenon of flavor mix is an intrins part of the standard
model but the part whose dynam is not understood the world would be
simpler without flavor mix but natur seem to prefer to go off the simplest
road obvious the mix between the famili is intrins relat to
the dynam of quark mass gener the observ fact that the flavor
mix angl in the quark sector are small must be relat to the strong mass
hierarchi observ in the mass spectrum
the standard parametr of the flavor mix matrix advoc by
the particl data group and the origin kobayashimaskawa parametrization7
were introduc without take possibl link between the quark mass and
the flavor mix paramet into account the parametr xing and
i introduc some time ago for a review see ref 5 is base on such a
connect although the specif relat between flavor mix angl and
quark mass might be more complic than commonli envisag it is a
parametr which allow to interpret the phenomenon of flavor mix as
an evolutionari or tumbl process in the limit in which the mass of the
light quark u d and the medium light quark c s are set to zero while
6
the heavi quark t b acquir their mass there is no flavor mix onc
the mass of the c squark are introduc while the u dquark remain
massless the flavor mix is reduc to an admixtur between two famili
describ by one angl as soon as the u and dquark mass are introduc
as small perturb the full flavor mix matrix involv a complex phase
paramet and two more mix angl u d appear these angl can be
interpret as rotat between the state u c and d s respect in
either the standard parametr or the kobayashimaskawa represent howev such specif limit are difficult to consid the represent

the typic estim of the quark mass give mu mc 006 008 a

the angl d is determin rather precis by the ratio md ms if
one take the result of chiral symmetri break into account one expect

in the represent i am advoc the mix strength between the
first and second gener is determin by the two mix angl u and
d both angl vanish if the mass of the light quark mu and md are
turn off in thi limit cp violat would not be present suppos onli one
of the light quark u d acquir a mass in thi case both u and d are
nonzero but one of the angl is extrem small it magnitud depend on
the actual structur of the mass matrix in specif models5 u is of the order
7
of md ms ms mb if mu is zero i e about 102 an order of magnitud
smaller than observ likewis d is of the order of mu mc mc mt if md
is zero i e about two order of magnitud smaller than the observ valu
thu the observ valu of the flavor mix angl u d give a strong hint
that neither mu nor md are vanish
the mix element vu is given by
vu
su sd ei
6
where sud sinud thu a precis determin of vu along with a precis
determin of su and sd would allow to determin the phase respons
for cp violat
in the mass matrix model mention abov u and d are given by
mu mc and md ms respect the relat for vu fix a triangl in
the complex phase which is congruent to the unitar triangle5
it is wellknown that the absolut valu of the cabibbo transit vu is
essenti ident to md ms which can be determin veri well from the
chiral dynam of qcd thu there is littl space for the contribut from
su and one conclud that the cp violat phase must be close to 900 a
situat which can be describ as maxim cp violation5
the pictur which emerg is the follow in the absenc of the u and d
mass onli one mix angl describ the mix between the second and
third famili is present at the second step the mix angl d md ms
appear while u mu ms can be introduc in a third step the cabibbo
transit vcd is then given by
vcd d u ei

cp violat is clearli seen as a phenomenon relat to the gener of
mass for the first famili as mention abov the observ absolut magnitud of vu and vcd agre with the ratio md ms and the correct come
from mu mc cannot be sizeabl impli that the phase angl must be
close to 900 in thi case one can rewrit vcd as follow
vcd
md

mu
mc
8
i e the mass of the uquark enter with a neg sign such that a phase
angl of 900 appear thi phase angl of 900 might be a signal for a specif
discret symmetri sinc the phase angl correspond to the angl in the
8
unitar triangl it is impli that the unitar triangl is rectangular the
other two angl and are given in term of the two mass ratio mu mc
and md ms take the central valu of the quark mass one find
20 sin2 064 and 700 more specif the rang of sin 2 vari
between 056 and 070 as we vari mu mc in the most like rang 006
008 the experiment data from babar and bell are consistend with thi
rang of valu for sin 2 but differ so much from each other that a clear
conclus cannot be drawn nevertheless the valu sin 2 070 seem to
me the upper edg of the allow rang if the experi eventu give a
higher valu the theoret basi of connect the flavor mix angl with
quark mass ratio as discuss becom question
but even if thi would be the case which i doubt we must conclud that
the success of the standard model with respect to cp violat is impress
it strength both is the k meson sector and in the b meson sector is predict
by paramet which on their own have noth to do with cp violat but
rather with flavor violat the flavor mix angl the phase paramet
describ the cp violat is larg it might even be 900 in view of thi
success it seem unlik to me that the observ cp violat come from
someth els than the mechan offer for free by the standard model
where it is link to the flavor mix howev small deviat from the
standard model expect might be there and should be search for in the
futur whether they are there and whether they are specif enough to point
toward a specif model like the supersymmetr extens of the standard
model remain to be seen
close thi confer let me thank especi also in the name of all
foreign particip the organ committe and in particular it chairman
prof yueliang wu for take on the complic task to organ thi
