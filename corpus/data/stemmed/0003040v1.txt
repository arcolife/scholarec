ie the tf energi and densiti is obtain by minim e with l53 r3 and n the
eulerlagrang equat call the thomasfermi
equat is
thomasfermi theori sometim
call the statist theori it wa invent by
l h thomasth and e fermief shortli after
schroding invent hi quantummechan wave
equat in order to approxim describ the electron densiti x x r3 and the ground state
energi en for a larg atom or molecul with a
larg number n of electron schroding equat which would give the exact densiti and energi
cannot be easili handl when n is larg
a start point for the theori is the tf energi
function for a molecul with k nuclei of charg
zi 0 and locat ri r3 i 1 k it is
e
x23 x
where a max0 a is some constant lagrang
multipli and is the tf potenti

the justif for thi function is thi

the first term is roughli the minimum quantumn

produc an electron densiti
e tf n is a strictli convex decreas function
the second term is the attract interact of

thu a larg atom ie larg z is smaller than a
z 1 atom by a factor z 13 in radiu despit
thi seem paradox tf theori give the correct
electron densiti in a real atom so far as the bulk
of the electron is concern as z
anoth import fact is the larg x asymptot
of tf
atom for a neutral atom as x
an import properti of the solut is teller
theorem et prove rigor in ls which impli that the tf molecul is alway unstabl ie
for each n z there are k number nj 0 zj

where

is crucial for thi result the inequ is strict not
onli doe e tf decreas when the nuclei are pull
infinit far apart which is what 4 say but ani
dilat of the nuclear coordin rj rj 1
will decreas e tf in the neutral case posit of
the pressur el bl thi theorem play an import role in the stabil of matter
an import question concern the connect between e tf n and e q n the ground state energi
infimum of the spectrum of the schroding oper h it wa meant to approxim
independ of z again thi behavior agre with
quantum mechan on a length scale z 13 which
is where the bulk of the electron are to be found
in light of the limit theorem 5 teller theorem
can be understood as say that as z the
quantum mechan bind energi of a molecul is
of lower order in z than the total ground state energi
thu teller theorem is not a defect of tf theori
although it is sometim interpret that way but
an import statement about the true quantum mechan situat
for finit z one can show use the liebthir
