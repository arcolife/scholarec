electron scatter is known to be one of the most power mean to
studi both the structur of nuclei and the intern structur of the nucleon especi the less known strang and axial form factor in particular inclus ee process at or near quasielast peak kinemat have
attract attent in the last two decad and sever experi have
been perform with the aim of disentangl the longitudin and transvers contribut to the quasielast cross section these are link to the
hadron tensor

where q q is the fourmomentum carri by the virtual photon
j is the nuclear manybodi current oper and the nuclear state i
and f are exact eigenst of the nuclear hamiltonian with definit fourmomentum the gener form 1 includ all possibl final state that
can be reach through the action of the current oper j on the exact
ground state here we focu on the oneparticl onehol 1p1h excit
the simpl impuls approxim while explain the electron scatter reaction mechan around the quasielast peak reason well is
unabl to account for the observ strength in the dip region between the
quasielast and peak where meson product includ via the
and twobodi current should be taken into account

most of the exist calcul that includ nuclear correl have
been perform within a nonrelativist framework where nonrelativist
wave function and current oper are obtain use standard expans which view both the momentum transfer q and the energi transfer
as be small compar to the nucleon mass m for highenergi condit
the current oper so obtain are obvious inadequ and new express are need thi provid the focu for the develop in 1 2 3
where new current oper that are exact as far as the variabl and q
are concern were deriv

sinc the physic of the qep is remot not onli from the physic surfac
of the nucleu but from the fermi surfac as well we consid a treatment
in term of nucleon and meson degre of freedom the latter view
both as forc and current carrier to be appropri henc as a first step
we focu on pion as they can be expect under these condit to be
the major carrier of the current that respond to an extern electromagnet field imping on the nucleu moreov sinc the effect of pion
on the free respons of the relativist fermi ga are not expect to be
too disrupt the interact is dealt with in first order of perturb
theori which amount to consid the manybodi feynman diagram in

same as fig 1 for the transvers respons
the numer result are display in fig 2 and 3 where the global
respons in first order of perturb theori are compar with the free
one for sever momentum transfer the overal effect of the twobodi
current appear suffici modest to justifi our firstord treatment
moreov the soften at larg q appear to be common to both l and t
channel wherea at low q the longitudin respons display a harden
that is absent in the transvers one also evid is the almost vanish
of the twobodi correl contribut at the peak of the free respons
a detail analysi of the separ contribut of the diagram in
fig 1 is present in ref 4 5 here we summar the main result
the mec are almost irrelev in the longitudin channel wherea
teir contribut typic amount to about 510 in the transvers
one
the impact of the correl current is substanti in both the longitudin and transvers respons though it is actual domin in the
former due to the small of the isoscalar magnet moment
the mec and correl effect tend to cancel in the transvers channel especi for low valu of q wherea for higher valu of the
momentum transfer the mec domin
the selfenergi contribut aris from a delic cancel of diagram 1f and 1g as alreadi point out in ref 6 in a semirelativist
context
to stress the relev of relativist effect in fig 4 we compar the mec
relativist effect in quasielast electron scattering5
contribut to the transvers respons with the nonrelativist calcul of 7 for q 500 mevc it clearli appear that apart from the
differ stem from the relativist kinemat which shrink the respons domain the relativist respons are about 30 smaller than the
nonrelativist one indic that rel play an import role even
for not so high qvalu
figur 4 transvers mec contribut solid compar with the nonrelativist calcul of ref 7 dash
we can now studi the evolut of the mec and correl with the
momentum transfer and with the densiti such depend are clearli
relev in connect with analys of scale in nuclei 8 both of first
and second kind from our result it emerg that
scale of first kind independ of q is attain at high momentum
transfer
scale of second kind independ of kf is broken through depend roughli on the fermi momentum squar for all valu of q
thi point is best illustr by display the respons as function of the
scale variable8

in fig 5a the ratio rm

gevc but then it rapidli satur at q 1 gevc where it valu stabil typic around 10 thu scale of the first kind is satisfi in
fig 5b the same ratio is plot versu at q1 gevc for kf vari
from 200 to 300 mevc it clearli appear that the rel mec contribut grow with kf attain a valu of about 20 at kf 300 mevc

indic that the mec content of rt increas with the denisti roughli
as kf2 in contrast with the free respons which decreas as kf1 similar
figur 5 the ratio mecfre in the transvers channel plot versu at kf 237
mevc for variou valu of q in gevc in panel a and for variou valu of kf in
mevc at q1 gevc in panel b
result hold for the correl contributions4 we can thu conclud that
the pionic effect in the repons function do not go away as q becom veri
larg and attain scale of the first kind at momentum transfer somewhat
abov 1 gevc while scale of the second kind is badli violat
