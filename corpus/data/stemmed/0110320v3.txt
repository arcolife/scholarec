we examin the potenti for detect and studi higg boson at a photonphoton collid facil
associ with a futur linear collid our studi incorpor realist luminos spectra base on
the most probabl avail laser technolog result includ detector simul we studi the case
of a a smlike higg boson b the heavi mssm higg boson c a higg boson with no w wzz
coupl from a gener two higg doublet model

introduct
higg product in collis first studi in 1 2 offer a uniqu capabl to measur the twophoton
width of the higg and to determin it charg conjug and pariti cp composit through control
of the photon polar both measur have uniqu valu in understand the natur of a higg
boson eigenst photonphoton collis also offer one of the best mean for produc a heavi higg
boson singli impli significantli greater mass reach than e e product of a pair of higg boson in
thi paper we present a realist assess of the prospect for these studi base on the current next
linear collid nlc machin and detector design 3 4 5 but we will also comment on chang in our
result base on the tevenergi superconduct linear acceler tesla design 6 when refer
to either of these machin in a gener context we will use the phrase linear collid lc summari of
and refer to other recent work on higg product at the lc appear in 3 4 5 6 in our work we
attempt to assess the potenti of higg product use a realist comput of the luminos and
polar of the collid backscatt photon and of the result background includ detector
simul and appropri cut we will particularli focu on a studi a light standardmodellik
higg boson includ a determin of it cp and b determin the best strategi for detect the
heavi higg boson of the mssm for model paramet choic such that they will not be seen either at
the lhc or in e e collis oper of the lc
there are mani import reason for measur the coupl of a higg boson gener denot
h in the standard model sm the coupl of the higg boson hsm to two photon receiv contribut
1
from loop contain ani charg particl whose mass aris in whole or part from the vacuum expect
valu vev of the neutral higg field in the limit of infinit mass for the charg particl in the loop
the contribut asymptot to a valu that depend on the particl spin ie the contribut doe
not decoupl thu a measur of hsm provid the possibl of reveal the presenc
of arbitrarili heavi charg particl sinc in the sm context all particl acquir mass via the higg
mechanism1 of cours sinc such mass are basic proport to some coupl time v 174 gev
the higg field vacuum expect valu if the coupl is perturb the mass of these heavi
particl are unlik to be much larger than 05 1 tev sinc brhsm x is entir determin by
the spectrum of light particl and is thu not affect by heavi state n hsm x hsm
brhsm x will then provid an extraordinari probe for such heavi state
even if there are no new particl that acquir mass via the higg mechan a precis measur
of n h x for specif final state x x bb w w can allow one to distinguish between
a h that is part of a larger higg sector and the sm hsm the abil to detect deviat from sm
expect will be enhanc by combin thi with other type of precis measur for the smlike higg boson observ of small deviat would be typic for an extend higg sector as one
approach the decoupl limit in which all other higg boson are fairli heavi leav behind one smlike
light higg boson in such model the observ small deviat could then be interpret as impli the
presenc of heavier higg boson typically2 deviat exceed 5 if the other heavier higg boson have
mass below about 400 to 500 gev a precis measur of the deviat coupl with enough other
inform about the model might then allow one to constrain the mass of the heavier higg boson
therebi allow one to understand how to go about detect them directli for exampl in the case
of the twodoublet minim supersymmetr standard model mssm higg sector there are five physic
higg boson two cpeven h0 and mh 0 with mh0 mh 0 one cpodd a0 and a charg higg pair
h in thi model signific deviat of the h0 properti from those of the hsm would indic that
ma0 might well be suffici small that the approxim degener h 0 and a0 could be discov in
h 0 a0 product at a lc collid with energi of order s 500 600 gev
of cours the abil to detect h 0 a0 will be of greatest import if the h 0 and a0 cannot
be detect either at the larg hadron collid lhc or in e e collis at the lc in fact there is a
veri signific section of paramet space in the mssm for which thi is the case often refer to as the
wedg region the wedg basic occupi the follow region of ma0 tan paramet space
0 0
m a0 m h 0
s2 for which e e h a pair product is imposs we will be focus
on an lc with s 630 gev impli that the wedg begin at ma0 315 gev
1
tan 3 below thi the lhc will be abl to detect the h 0 a0 in a varieti of mode such as
0
0
h 0 h0 h0 and a0 zh0 for ma0
2mt and h a tt for ma0
2mt in some version of the
loop contribut from charg particl that acquir a larg mass from some other mechan beyond the sm context
will decoupl as mass2 and if there is a smlike higg boson h h will not be sensit to their presenc
2
but there are except region of paramet space for which thi is not true 7
2
mssm eg the maxim mix scenario most of thi region is alreadi elimin by constraint
from the larg electron positron collid lep data
tan tan min ma0 where tan min ma0 is the minimum valu of tan for which the lhc can
detect bbh 0 bba0 product in the a0 h 0 decay mode current deem the most
access tan min ma0 rise from 12 at ma0 315 gev to 18 at ma0 500 gev
in thi wedg the lc altern of e e bbh 0 and e e bba0 product also have such
extrem small rate as to be undetect see eg 8
thi wedg will be discuss in greater detail later in the paper a lc for which the maximum e e
center of mass energi is s 630 gev can potenti probe higg mass in collis as high as
500 gev the point at which the luminos spectrum run out an import goal of thi paper is
to determin the portion of the wedg ma0 tan paramet region for which h 0 a0 will be detect
via collis we find the follow
if mh 0 and ma0 are known to within roughli 50 gev on the basi of precis h0 data and there is
suffici knowledg of other mssm paramet from the lhc to know how to interpret these data
then we find that it is almost certain that we can detect the h 0 and a0 by employ just one or
two s set and electronlaserphoton polar such as to produc a spectrum peak in
the region of interest
howev it is veri possibl that there will be no fulli reliabl constraint on the h 0 a0 mass other
than ma0 mh 0 s2 from lc run in the e e collis mode in thi case for expect
luminos the simplest and probabl also the most effici procedur will be to simpli oper
the machin at a singl high energi roughli 23 to 34 of the time use electronlaserphoton
polar configur that produc a broad spectrum e spectrum and 13 to 14 of the time
use configur that yield a spectrum peak at high e we will find that after three to four
year of oper thi procedur will yield a visibl signal for h 0 a0 product for most of the
wedg paramet space and more gener for mani ma0 tan paramet choic
earlier work on detect the heavi mssm higg boson in collis appear in 9 10 our studi
employ the best avail predict for the luminos spectrum and polar use the realist
assumpt of 80 polar for the collid electron beam
the collid would also play a veri import role in explor a nonsupersymmetr gener twohiggsdoublet model 2hdm in thi paper we will explor the role of a collid in the context of a
cpconserv cpc typeii
3
2hdm of which the mssm higg sector is a special case in particular
there are cpc typeii 2hdm with higg sector potenti for which the lightest higg boson is not at all
smlike despit the fact that the other higg boson are fairli heavi sever such model were consid
3
in a typeii 2hdm at treelevel the vacuum expect valu of the neutral field of one doublet give rise to uptyp
quark mass while the vev of the neutral field of the second doublet give rise to downtyp quark mass and lepton mass
3
in ref 11 in the model consid there is a light higg boson with no w w zz coupl gener
denot h while all other higg boson includ a heavi neutral higg boson with smlike coupl
are heavier than s further there is a wedg somewhat analog to but larger than that of the
mssm of moder tan valu in which the e e bbh and e e tth product process both
yield fewer than 20 event for l 1 ab1 and in which lhc detect will also be imposs if mh is also
so heavi mh 150 gev 250 gev for s 500 gev 800 gev respect as to yield few or no event
in e e z hh or e e hh product then onli h bb might allow detect of the h
we again find that such detect would be possibl for a signific fraction of the mh tan paramet
space that is not access at the lhc or in e e lc oper the precis valu depend upon the
luminos expend for the search
onc one or sever higg boson have been detect precis studi can be perform primari on
the list would be the determin of the cp natur of ani observ higg boson thi and other type
of measur becom especi import if one is in the decoupl limit of a 2hdm the decoupl
limit is defin by the situat in which there is a light smlike higg boson while the other higg boson
h 0 a0 h are heavi and quit degener in the mssm context such decoupl is automat in the
limit of larg ma0 in thi situat a detail scan to separ the h 0 and a0 would be veri import
and entir possibl at the collid further measur of rel branch fraction for the h 0
and a0 to variou possibl final state would also be possibl and reveal much about the higg sector model
in the mssm context the branch ratio for supersymmetr final state would be measur these are
especi import for determin the basic supersymmetri break paramet 12 13 14 15 9 10

polar of the collid photon and for suitabl cut our procedur yield a realist assess
of the prospect for higg studi and detect via collis for the variou sm mssm and 2hdm
scenario we consid the basic point is that the luminos spectra and polar we employ predict
that the jz 2 background is far larger than the jz 0 background after cut consequ even if nlo
correct enhanc the jz 0 background by a factor of 5 to 10 as is possibl the jz 0 background
will still yield at most a 1020 correct to the jz 2 background at low higg mass 120 gev

and a 510 correct at high higg mass 300 gev such correct are well within the other
uncertainti implicit in thi studi further the nlo correct do not significantli alter the shape of the

and are plot as a function of y in fig 1
for the three independ choic of rel electron and laser polar orient and for x 569
x 4334 and x 186 the relev of these particular x valu will emerg veri shortli we observ
that the choic i of e e 4 p p 1 give larg and f y 1 for small to moder
y the choic ii of e e 4 p p 1 yield a peak spectrum with 085 at the
peak final the choic iii of e e 4 p 1 p 1 give a broad spectrum but never achiev
larg as earlier note larg valu of are import for suppress the bb continuum higg
detect background with lead treelevel term 1 thu the peak spectrum choic ii
is most suit to higg studi in fact becaus increas rapidli as y increas just past the peak
locat it is alway possibl to find a valu of y for which f y 95 of it peak valu while 09
a final import point is to note that it is realli veri import for both e beam to be polar in
order to minim the 1 compon of the background and that luminos and polar at the
peak are veri significantli reduc if one beam is unpolar current technolog onli allow for larg e
polar at high luminos unless techniqu for achiev larg e polar at high luminos
are develop 19 higg studi at a collid demand e e collis thu it may be veri difficult to
perform higg studi at a 2nd parasit interact region dure e e oper
let us now turn to the relev of the particular x valu illustr in fig 1 if the laser energi is
adjust x 48 is often deem to be an optim choic yield ymax 082 in that it is the largest
valu consist with be below the pair creation threshold while at the same time it maxim the
peak structur at y 08 for the case ii spectrum more realist howev the fundament laser
wavelength will be fix the livermor group ha determin that a wavelength of 1054 micron is the
most technolog feasibl valu see section 5 of chapter 13 p 359366 of ref 3 the subpuls
energi of the livermor design is 1 joul thi result in a probabl of 65 that a given electron in
one bunch will interact with a photon higher valu for the subpuls energi are possibl but would result
in more multipl interact and increas nonlinear effect the subpuls energi chosen is felt to be a
good compromis valu for achiev good luminos without be overwhelm by such effect
for a fix wavelength x will vari as the machin energi is vari for a wavelength of 1054
repres valu are x 186 at a machin energi of s 206 gev for which p e 0 p e 0
yield a spectrum peak at e 120 gev as appropri for a light higg boson and x 569 at
s 630 gev for which p e 0 p e 0 yield a spectrum peak at e 500 gev as appropri
for a heavi higg boson howev as illustr in fig 1 the peak for x 186 is not veri strong
as compar to higher x valu further the valu of 1 at the peak to which background for
7
higg detect are proport for x 186 is somewhat larger than for larg x valu fortun the
livermor group ha develop a techniqu by which the laser frequenc can be tripled4 in thi way the
x valu can be tripl for a given s allow for a much more peak spectrum and smaller 1
at the peak for the light higg case for 13 a spectrum peak at e 120 gev is obtain by
oper at s 160 gev yield x 4334 the spectra for thi case is also plot in fig 1 the
much improv peak for x 4334 as compar to x 186 is appar regard x 569 it ha
been argu in the past that x 48 is undesir in that it lead to pair creation howev our studi
which includ these effect indic that the result background are not a problem
we will return to the import of includ the full depend of the accept on z and z shortli
for now let us continu to neglect thi depend and review a few more of the standard result
realist e spectra

there are import correct to the naiv luminos distribut just consid first the luminos
at low e is affect by two conflict correct finit suppress the low luminos howev
thi effect is more than compens by beamstrahlung secondari collis between scatter electron
and photon from the laser beam and other nonlinear effect the result is a substanti enhanc
of the luminos in the low region thi is illustr in fig 2 for case ii polar orient
choic and for s 160 gev which yield x 433 for a 1054 micron laser sourc run with the
frequenc tripler and a cpip separ between the photon convers point cp and photonphoton
interact point ip of 1 mm we also note that all the spectra consid here were obtain for flat
electron beam for a given cpip separ round electron beam would give a factor of roughli two
larger luminos howev we chose the flat beam configur for consist with the finalfocu and
collim arrang that will be use in e e collis as expect from fig 1 the spectrum show
a peak at e 120 gev as might correspond to a light higg boson mass howev the low tail is
now quit substanti thi impli that it will be veri import to achiev a small mass resolut re
for the final state reconstruct the luminos l in the bin center at e 120 gev is equival
to dlde 066 fb1 gev per 107 sec year the correspond luminos at tesla could be as much
as a factor of 2 larger due to higher repetit rate and larger charg per bunch if one wish to avoid a
larg low tail then it is necessari to have a significantli differ configur includ much larger
cpip separ andor a highfield sweep magnet these option were consid also use the cain
program in the asian committe for futur acceler acfa report 4 where a cpip separ of
1 cm wa adopt and a 3 tesla sweep magnet wa employ 5 the disadvantag of thi arrang is
a substanti lower valu for dlde at the peak at least for the correspond bunch charg repetit
4
in order to tripl the laser photon frequenc one must employ nonlinear optic the effici with which the standard
1054 laser beam is convert to 0351 is 70 thu roughli 40 more laser power is requir in order to retain the
subpuls power of 1 joul as deem roughli optim in the livermor studi
5
for earlier nlc studi a cpip separ of 05 cm wa use and sweep magnet were not incorpor

that the cain mont carlo predict that thi behavior of is smooth out somewhat after includ

onli track and shower with co 09 in the laboratori frame are accept
track are requir to have momentum greater than 200 mev and shower must have energi greater
than 100 mev
we then focu on the two most energet jet in the event with jet defin use ycut 002
we requir these two jet to be backtoback in three dimens use the criteria p1i p2i 12 gev
for i x y z
we requir co 05 where is the angl of the two most energet jet in their center of

we note that even though we do not explicitli requir exactli twojet in the final state the third and
fourth cut list abov especi the backtoback requir result in 90 of the retain event
contain exactli two jet
we employ the two most energet jet after impos the cut given abov to reconstruct the higg
boson signal our mass resolut for the narrowwidth higg boson signal is 476 013 gev for a
gaussian fit from 1 to 108 which is similar to the 6 gev found in 21 we believ that the
differ in mass resolut is due primarili to differ in the mont carlo employ if we keep onli
event with m2

110 gev there are roughli 1450 signal event and about 335 background event
after all cut thi would yield a measur of hsm brhsm bb with an accuraci of
s bs 29 9 the error for thi measur increas to about 10 for mhsm 160 gev given
the predict signal rate s b 1 1 and 085 at the peak these accuraci are those estim
for one 107 sec year of oper deviat due to h hsm in an extend higg sector model typic
exceed 3 if the other heavier higg boson have mass below about 500 gev so that there are signific
correct to the decoupl limit to obtain the abov result excel b tag is essenti to elimin

we employ thi rang in order to avoid the rapidli rise background at low mass and the mass distribut tail at
mass below the reson peak come from reconstruct

the more optimist error of close to 2 quot in 21 for mhsm 120 gev is base upon a higher peak luminos
we estim a factor
2 larger peak luminos at tesla come primarili from rep rate and bunch charg densiti the
tesla analyz also assum a somewhat higher beam polar the result is that tesla error will be about a factor of
2 smaller than error we estim as is consist with the 2 vs 29 error at mhsm 120 gev the error for the acfa
design of ref 4 is about 76 for we believ about 3 year of run which is much larger than the error we achiev after
just one year of oper thi differ is larg due to the factor of nearli 5 smaller valu of dlde at the peak and
would have been even greater if more realist 100 polar for the e beam had been employ

we should note explicitli that we have perform our background and signal cross section calcul

the import of be abl to perform full simul analyz someth that is onli possibl in the
context of pandora and jetset for the signal and in the context of pythia and jetset for the
background we estim our error are not more than 1020 as a result of ignor higher order

in mani scenario it is veri possibl that by combin result from h0 bb with other type

10
precis measur could provid addit indirect

receiv correct from loop involv the extra higg boson howev to directli produc the heavier
higg in e e collis is like to requir larg machin energi for exampl in the 2hdm e e h 0 a0

we will show that singl h 0 a0 product via collis will allow their discoveri throughout a
larg fraction of thi wedg the event rate see eq 6 can be substanti due to quark loop contribut
mainli t and at high tan b and loop contain other new particl eg the chargino of supersymmetri in thi studi we will also assum that the superparticl mass for the chargino squark
slepton etc are suffici heavi that a the higg boson do not decay to superparticl and b the
superparticl loop contribut to the coupl are neglig
14
assum no reliabl preconstraint on ma0 mh 0 an import question is whether it is best to search
for the h 0 a0 by scan in s and therebi in e assum typeii peak spectrum configur
or run at fix s use a broad e spectrum part of the time and a peak spectrum the rest of
the time 1 as we shall discuss if cover the wedg region is the goal then run at a singl energi
part of the time with a peak e luminos distribut and part of the time with a broad distribut
in ratio 21 would be a somewhat prefer approach
figur 5 we plot the integr h 0 and a0 higg cross section i as defin in eq 6 as a function of
higg mass for a varieti of tan valu we employ the maximalmix scenario with msusi 1 tev
supersymmetr particl loop are neglect
the first import input to the calcul is the effect integr cross section i as defin in
eq 6 for the h 0 and a0 these cross section are plot as a function of higg mass for a varieti of
tan valu in fig 5 we have comput the cross section use the bb branch ratio and width
obtain from hdecay 28 use input mass of ma0 as plot on the xax we have employ

restrict to ma0 500 gev due to the fact that if the lc is oper at
s 630 gev correspond
to x 569 for 1 micron laser wavelength we can potenti probe higg mass as high as 500 gev
figur 6 we plot the sum h 0 brh 0 bb a0 bra0 bb as a function of tan
for sever ma0 valu the signal rate n h 0 a0 bb is roughli proport to thi quantiti
result for the five case delin in the text are shown
an interest question is the extent to which these input are model depend in that they are sensit
to other paramet of the mssm our studi ha been perform for the maximalmix scenario with
mt 175 gev and msusi 1 tev assum that all susi particl are heavi enough to not significantli
influenc the h 0 a0 coupl and heavi enough that h 0 a0 susi decay are not signific
in the context of hdecay we have set iofsusy1 if susi particl are moder light there
will be some but not dramat modif to the coupl and some dilut of the h 0 a0 bb
branch ratio these effect will be minim at the higher tan valu in the wedg region but could
make discoveri in the bb channel difficult for some of the lower tan point one would undoubtedli
tri to make use of the susi decay channel themselv to enhanc the net signal for h 0 a0
even if susi particl are all heavi there could be some variat as one move from the maximalmix
scenario to the nomix scenario and so forth further there are certain nondecoupl loop correct
16
to the relat between mb and the h 0 a0 bb yukawa coupl that could either enhanc or diminish
the h 0 a0 bb rate 29 these are not current incorpor into the standard version of
hdecay we have perform a limit explor by consid five case comput for case
iiv are perform use version 20 of hdecay ie that avail as of septemb 2001
i the maximalmix scenario defin abov
ii the maximalmix scenario as abov but with 1 tev
iii the nomix scenario defin by ab a at tan with msusi 1 tev
iv the maximalmix scenario as in case i but with 0
v in thi case we employ the maxim mix scenario with msusi 1 tev but employ a modifi
version of hdecay provid by the author of ref 29 in which the b correct to the
higg bb vertic are includ these aris from loop correct involv supersymmetr particl
neglect in case iiv and are most substanti when tan is larg these correct do not
vanish ie do not decoupl even when susi particl mass are larg the correct would have
opposit sign to those plot for 1 tev
the result in each of the abov five case for h 0 brh 0 bb a0 bra0 bb to
which the signal rate n h 0 a0 bb is roughli proport are plot in fig 6 as a function
of tan for sever ma0 valu we observ that although there is consider model depend for the
rel low mass of ma0 150 gev thi model depend becom quit minim when compar
case iiv for ma0 250 gev ie in the wedg region of interest howev result for case v show that
susi loop correct can impact the predict signal event rate onc tan is larg enough but remain
minim for ma0 500 gev and tan valu in the wedg region

the luminos enhanc at low e rel to naiv expect in the case of the typeii spectrum the luminos remain quit larg even below the e peak at e 500 gev and that
is larg for e 450 gev in the case of the typei spectrum the luminos grow is substanti for
e 400 gev and rise rapidli with decreas e in addit reason larg is retain for
250 e 400 gev howev in both case the valu of are alway small enough that the jz 2
part of the bb background to higg detect will be onli partial suppress by the 1 factor and
will be domin
the final ingredi is to assess the impact of the cut requir to reduc the bbg and ccg background
to an accept level in order to access the higg boson with mass substanti below the machin

is the angl of the two most energet jet rel to the beam direct in the twojet rest frame is far
more optim than is a cut of co 05 where is the angl of a jet in the laboratori frame thi is
illustr in fig 7 where it is seen that the former cut on lead to much higher luminos than the
latter cut on thu even though slightli larger is obtain use the cut much better signal
rel to background are achiev use the cut a second cut is that impos upon the twojet
mass distribut the optim valu for thi cut depend upon the higg width the degre of degeneraci
of the h 0 and a0 mass and the detector resolut and reconstruct techniqu
figur 8 we plot the total width of the a0 as a function of ma0 for our standard set of tan valu

figur 8 show the total a0 width as a function for ma0 for our standard set of tan valu for the

narrow with width below 3 gev in fact the width of the twojet mass distribut will probabl
deriv mostli from detector resolut and reconstruct procedur a full mont carlo analysi for
heavi higg boson with rel small width is not yet avail howev there are mani claim in the
literatur that the result mass resolut will almost certainli be better than m2jet 30 m2jet

the result obtain assum ejet 18 ejet for each of the backtoback jet 3 4 5 6 veri roughli
thi correspond to a fullwidth at half maximum of about 6 gev in the mass rang from 250 500 gev
of interest
figur 9 we plot differ mh 0 ma0 as a function of ma0 for our standard set of tan valu result
are those from hdecay for the earlier defin maxim mix scenario with msusi 1 tev
supersymmetr particl loop are neglect
the second import ingredi in understand the natur of h 0 a0 signal is the degre to which
they are degener in mass the degre of nondegeneraci is plot in fig 9 for tan 2 and
3 the mass differ at lower ma0 are such that the h 0 and a0 peak would remain substanti
separ even after includ 6 gev experiment mass resolut howev start with tan 5
and for larger ma0 2mt in the tan 2 3 case the mass differ is suffici small and their
total width suffici larg that after includ experiment mass resolut there will be consider
overlap between the h 0 and a0 peak a central locat 10 gev bin would pick up a larg fraction of
the h 0 and a0 event the assumpt that 50 of the total number of h 0 and a0 event fall into one 10
gev bin center on ma0 is thu an approxim way of take into account both the 6 gev experiment
mass resolut the few gev total width and the nondegeneraci while 50 is probabl an overestim
20
for tan 2 3 and lower ma0 it is not much of an overestim becaus for these paramet case the
a0 signal is much stronger than the h 0 signal in ani case see fig 5 the 50 assumpt is probabl
a conserv approxim for tan 5 and abov and is probabl onli a bit of an overestim for
tan 3 and ma0 350 gev a full simul of both the h 0 and the a0 peak as a function of tan
and ma0 is requir to do the job properli howev we have found that the exist mont carlo seem
to give too larg an experiment mass resolut further refin of the mont carlo will be requir
befor a complet simul will be possibl
our full list of cut is then as follow
onli track and shower with co 09 in the laboratori frame are accept
track have to have momentum greater than 200 mev and shower must have energi greater than
100 mev
we focu on the two most energet jet in the event with jet defin use the durham algorithm
with ycut 002
we requir these two jet to be backtoback in two dimens use the criteria p1i p2i 50 gev
for i x y transvers to the beam
we requir co 05 where is the angl of the jet rel to the beam direct in the
twojet center of mass as discuss the altern of co 05 is not desir for retain
larg luminos at lower e in the broad band spectrum it also doe not significantli alter the
statist signific for the peak spectrum case
after the backtoback and co cut about 95 of the event retain contain exactli two jet
final we estim the number of event with ma0 5 gev m2jet ma0 5 gev as follow
as in the light higg studi we assum an effici of 70 for doubletag the two jet as bb in
addit to the reconstruct effici which we find to be nearli constant at 35 and the btag
effici of 70 we assum that onli 50 of the higg event fall within thi 10 gev bin in effect
these reconstruct btag and mass accept effici result in a net effici of 1225 for
retain higg event the effici for the bb background is much smaller due primarili to the fact that
the reconstruct effici is far smaller than the 35 that is applic for the higg event thi is
due primarili to the veri forwardbackward natur of the background event as compar to the uniform
distribut in co of the higg event the cc background befor btag is substanti larger than
the bb background howev after doubletag we employ a probabl of 35 for doubletag a
cc event as a bb event the bb and cc background are compar
higher order nlo correct to the jz 0 cc and bb background can be substanti howev the
jz 2 background are so much larger after our cut in particular the twojet cut that even if the
jz 0 background is increas by a factor of 5 to 10 by the nlo correct the total background would
increas by onli 5 to 10 for a more detail discuss see appendix b

the 1523 becom 1823 further for s 630 gev it is veri probabl that one could see h 0 a0 pair
product for ma0 300 gev in which case collis oper with factor 2 type accumul
luminos would allow detect of h 0 a0 throughout most of the remain portion of the wedg
in which they cannot be seen by other mean final we note that other channel than bb are avail at
low tan we expect that the h0 h0 channel for the h 0 and the zh0 channel for a0 will provid observ
signal for the remain wedg point with ma0 2mt 350 gev the tt channel might provid further
confirm for bb signal for wedg point with ma0 450 gev the singl most difficult wedg point is
ma0 400 tan 15 which is at the edg of the lhc wedg region
it is import to realiz that if the lhc wa abl to detect the h higg boson in some portion
of the wedg region for exampl use the h decay mode a reason accur 25 gev
determin of mh would emerg if studi of the susi particl indic that the mssm is the
correct theori then we would employ the model predict that ma0 mh 0 mh and run the
collid with typeii peak spectrum at the s valu yield epeak mh unfortun the latest
simul result as repres in fig 4 indic that the h can onli be detect if tan is larger than
the upper boundari of the wedg region howev these studi are be continu refin ultim
the actual situat will onli be known onc the lhc start oper
we conclud that a collid can provid higg signal for the h 0 and a0 over a possibl crucial
portion of paramet space in which the lhc and direct e e collis at a lc will not be abl to detect
these higg boson or their h partner inde the collid is veri complementari to the lhc and
e e lc oper as regard the portion of ma0 tan paramet space over which a signal for the heavi
mssm higg boson can be detect
if a h 0 a0 signal is detect in the wedg region one will of cours reset the machin energi so that
epeak ma0 and proceed to obtain a highli accur determin of the h 0 a0 bb rate and
rate in other channel these rate will provid valuabl inform about susi paramet includ

for ma0
350 gev than the 2year typei 500 plu 1year typeii 500 option but would not provid
reliabl signal in the wedg region for ma0
325 gev
the abil to obtain a 4 signal in nearli all of the ma0
350 gev wedg use the 2year typei 500 plu 1year typeii 500 option is import sinc it is like that the collid will be run at
maximum energi for other physic reason thu if no signal for the h 0 a0 and h are detect at

h 0 a0 higg boson and pursu other physic studi supersymmetr particl product in particular
will be oper part time with typei and part time with typeii luminos spectra roughli in the

final we make a few remark regard the abil to detect the h 0 a0 for tan valu for which
the lhc would alreadi have detect a signal precis studi of the h 0 a0 bb rate and rate
in other channel as well would be an import sourc of inform and cross check becaus of the
mani differ type of particl in the mssm that potenti contribut to the h 0 a0 coupl
fig 6 show that the minimum rate in the bb final state occur at tan 15 when ma0 250 gev and
also though not plot ma0 300 gev and at tan 20 when ma0 350 gev thu the signal
are actual weakest precis in the upper part of the wedg region and somewhat beyond start with
tan valu suffici far abov the wedg region the signal becom stronger and stronger as tan
increas asymptot rise as tan2 but rise more like tan in the tan 30 50 rang thu
if other physic studi forc run at maxim s it is quit possibl to nonetheless have a strong

there is no h0 w w zz coupl here we will studi the case of a light a0 sinc it and not a light
h0 could play a role in explain the possibl discrep of the anomal magnet moment of the muon
with the sm predict 30 12 as discuss in 11 the precis electroweak constraint impli that if the
a0 is light and the other higg boson are heavi then the coupl of the h0 must be smlike further
perturb impli that the h0 should not be heavier than about 1 tev we would then be face with
a veri unexpect scenario the lhc would detect the heavi smlike h0 and no supersymmetr particl
would be discov the precis electroweak constraint which naiv requir a veri light hsm in the
absenc of addit physic would demand the exist of addit contribut to t as could be
verifi by gigaz oper of the lc the gener 2hdm provid the addit t contribut via a
mass split between the h and the h 0 both of which would have mass of order a tev detect of
the light a0 possibl need to explain the a deviat would be crucial in order to learn of the exist
of the extend higg sector
as for the h 0 and a0 of the mssm discoveri of an a0 with mass abov 200 to 250 gev could be
difficult if tan is chosen in the moder rang the a0 will not be seen in e e a0 bb or e e a0 tt
product 8 11 discoveri of the a0 would also be imposs at the lhc in a wedg of paramet
space veri similar to but somewhat more extend in tan assum no overlap reson with the
opposit cp than that found in the mssm case final such an a0 can onli be seen in e e za0 a0
or e e a0 a0 product through it quartic w w a0 a0 zza0 a0 coupl if ma0 150 gev
250 gev for s 500 gev 800 gev thu the abil to detect the a0 in a moder tan wedg
begin at ma0
250 gev use collis might turn out to be of great import in explor
thi abil we follow procedur close analog to the mssm studi
first we need the integr cross section i see eq 6 result are present in fig 17 in
comput i for the 2hdm a0 we assum that all the other 2hdm higg boson have mass of 1 tev
the main differ with the mssm is that sinc we take the h0 and h 0 to be heavi there are no
overlap signal event from a 2nd higg boson howev for ma0 2mt thi loss of overlap signal
is somewhat compens by increas a0 bb branch ratio due to the absenc of a0 zh0 decay
in the largemh0 scenario be envis
next as in the mssm case we consid
s 630 gev and employ the cain luminos spectrum
effici and cut are the same as in the mssm studi assum one year of 107 sec oper each
use typei broad spectrum and typeii peak spectrum we give result for the total signal rate after
all cut and effici in fig 18 the correspond statist signific nsd s b are also
shown in fig 19 we display those ma0 tan point for which two year of oper in typei mode
and one year of oper in typeii mode would allow 4 level discoveri of the a0 the addit point
for which a 4 signal would be achiev for 2 and 4 time as much luminos for both typei and typeii
12
in order for a light a0 to be the entir sourc of the origin publish deviat in a larg tan is requir 30 suffi
cientli larg that lhc andor lc detect would be probabl howev recent improv in the theoret predict
for a suggest that the a deviat could be smaller than origin thought in thi case or if other mechan contribut
the scenario we focu on of a moder light a0 and moder tan could be veri relev
33
figur 17 we consid a gener 2hdm and plot the integr a0 higg cross section i as defin in
eq 6 as a function of ma0 for a varieti of tan valu we have assum that all other higg boson
of the 2hdm have mass of order 1 tev
oper are also display we find that a reason fraction of the point in the wedg would allow
a0 detect after 3 year of collis a 4 signal is found for 1042 of the 42 sampl point that
might fall into the wedg in which the a0 would not be discov by other mean for a factor two higher
integr luminos eg after 6 year of oper at the nomin luminos predict by cain for the
current design thi fraction would increas to 1642
of cours one could also consid the 1year 350 typeii plu 1year 400 typeii plu 1year 500
typeii run option which would provid somewhat improv signal for ma0 350 gev and ma0
400 gev than doe the 2year 500 typei plu 1year 500 typeii option consid abov howev the
lhclc wedg in which the a0 cannot be discov is quit larg and certainli extend to ma0 valu as
low as 200 250 gev to which onli the latter option provid some sensit at lower tan regardless
of the run option chosen collis provid an import addit to our abil to detect the a0

in thi paper we have explor the variou way in which a collid could contribut to our understand of higg physic we have confin our studi to the bb final state we have shown the follow
for a smlike higg boson it will be possibl to determin hbrh bb with excel
precis eg 29 accuraci for mh 120 gev thi accuraci will be achiev after just one 107
sec year of oper use the frequenc tripler technolog and a peak e spectrum is the most
optim
by use the excel 1 2 measur of brh bb one can extract a 29 mea
surement for h as discuss in the introduct deviat of thi width from it sm
expect could be veri reveal in particular at thi level of accuraci deviat that might
be present as the result of the smlike higg boson be part of a larger higg sector such as that
of the mssm would typic be visibl if some of the other higg boson were not too much heavier
than 500 gev or so in the mssm context the precis magnitud of the deviat might thu allow
extract of the crucial mass scale ma0 if ma0 is known with suffici accuraci one would know
more or less exactli what s to employ so that detect of a0 h 0 at the collid would
be straightforward and would becom a high prioriti
even if there is no predetermin of ma0 detect of h 0 a0 is still like to be possibl for
a larg fraction of the problemat wedg of moderatetan paramet space describ earlier
for which the h 0 a0 will not be observ either at the lhc or at a lc for instanc for a lc
of s 630 gev the wedg begin at ma0
300 gev the approxim upper reach of the
e e h 0 a0 pair product process wherea the collid can potenti allow detect of
the h 0 a0 up to the e spectrum limit of about 500 gev inde use just bb final state our
result show that h 0 a0 detect will be possibl in somewhat more than 65 of the wedg after
two 107 sec year of oper use a broad spectrum and one year of oper use a peak
spectrum by also consid h 0 h0 h0 a0 zh0 and h 0 a0 tt final state we estim
that somewhat more than 85 of the wedg paramet region with ma0
500 gev would provid
a detect signal after a total of two to three year of oper
thu by combin s 630 gev collid oper with lc studi of e e collis and lhc
search for the mssm higg boson we would have an excel chanc of find all the neutral
higg boson of the mssm higg sector if they have mass
500 gev wherea without the
collid one would detect onli the h0 at both the lc and lhc in the problemat paramet
space wedg in short if we detect supersymmetr particl at the lhc and lc consist with the
mssm structur and find onli the h0 at the lc and lhc oper focus on higg discoveri
will be a high prioriti
41
the one caveat to thi veri optimist set of conclus regard the h 0 a0 is that if susi
0
0
particl are light mass
ma0 2 they will alter the predict for the h a coupl
and diminish the h 0 a0 bb branch ratio if these effect are veri strong as possibl at lower
tan detect of the h 0 a0 in the bb channel could becom significantli more difficult both in
collis and at the lhc susi decay channel would need to be employ howev at the
larger tan valu in the wedg region under consider the bb coupl is strongli enhanc and
it is unlik that these effect would be suffici larg to significantli alter our conclus
it is import to note that the h 0 a0 bb rate ha a minimum at tan 15 tan 20 for
m a0
300 gev ma0 350 gev ie tan valu that are just larg enough to be abov the wedg
region at higher ma0 thu the h 0 a0 bb rate increas for still higher tan roughli
linearli for tan in the 3050 rang consequ if the h 0 a0 are discov at the lhc becaus
tan is larg and yet other physic consider forc oper at maxim s rather than
at the s such that epeak ma0 there is a good possibl that the h 0 a0 bb signal will
be quit substanti if one choos the appropri typei or typeii spectrum for the ma0 valu
found at the lhc thi would then provid an opportun for a rel precis measur
of the veri interest h 0 a0 coupl that will not be access by ani other mean
thi in turn could lead to signific inform about other susi paramet in particular as
illustr in the main part of the paper tan can be determin with reason accuraci from
the h 0 a0 bb rate if the mass and properti of the susi particl are known from lhc
andor lc data most notabl the larger tan is the more accur will be thi determin
in contrast most other techniqu for determin tan eg from neutralino chargino gluino etc
cross section and branch ratio becom increasingli insensit to tan as tan increas
after three 107 sec year of oper 2 with typei spectrum and 1 with typeii spectrum it will
be possibl to detect the a0 of a gener twohiggsdoubl model in particular one with paramet
such that all other higg boson are heavi includ the smlike neutral higg over a substanti
portion of the paramet space in which it cannot be detect in ani other lc or lhc mode
determin of the cp natur of ani higg boson that can be observ will be possibl in colli
sion by employ transvers linearli polar laser beam photon in particular we studi the
case of a light smlike higg boson with mh 120 gev and show that the error in determin
of it cp 1 would be cpcp 011
for these variou purpos there is no question that maxim the luminos will be veri import in
the case of the nlc design we consid the result state abov would requir 1 107 sec year of oper
at low s for the light higg precis studi 1 year of oper at low s in the linearli polar mode
for the cp studi and 3 year of oper for the h 0 a0 search one in the peak spectrum mode and
two in the broad spectrum mode if one is constrain to run at the maxim s 630 gev assum in our
studi the extra factor of 2 in luminos that might be achiev at tesla would prove an advantag
42
further optim of the nlc design might also be possibl and is strongli encourag for instanc
go to a round beam configur keep the cpip separ at 1 mm might yield as much as a
factor of two increas in luminos
we should note that our studi have onli includ hadron background due to direct qed process
and have not yet incorpor background result from the hadron structur of the photon the photon
can resolv into quark or gluon plu spectat jet hadron product could then occur through
1resolv or 2resolv process resolv photon background have two contribut to
the background to higg product the first is that in which a quark or gluon constitu of one of
the backscatt photon is respons for initi a twobodi scatter process that creat a pair
of highpt b or c jet as discuss for exampl in ref 34 good btag effici and puriti as
employ here is requir in order to elimin other resolv photon twojet background such as gb or
gc final state howev it is gener the case that such contribut to the background are numer
unimport unless the higg mass is far below the maximum e thi wa first conclud in ref 34
and more recent confirm in ref 21 in the mh 120 gev case we studi the higg mass is quit
close to the maximum energi and in the h 0 a0 studi the higg mass is at least 50 of the maximum
energi for such choic thi kind of resolv photon background is not import in addit ani
residu resolv photon background of thi type could be further reduc by veto event in which there
is an extra remnant jet in the forward andor backward region such jet would tend to have transvers
and longitudin momentum of order 31 mh to 21 mh for the configur we employ and would therefor
be readili visibl in the detector
the second type of background from resolv photon process aris when a resolv photon scatter
process underli the primari higg product reaction these event aris when backscatt photon
other than those involv in the higg product reaction also interact thi can happen either use back
scatter photon aris in the same bunch cross or photon from two differ bunch cross within
the same detector readout interv cross section befor cut for produc rel soft jet deriv
from these resolv photon process are sever order of magnitud larger than the correspond direct
x cross section thu such addit scatter primarili yield addit lowpt jet that would
underli the bb jet aris from higg product they would thu make it less effici to isol the true
2bjet signal use cut that requir exactli two reconstruct jet which are rather precis backtoback
mass resolut could also deterior as might the effici for btag the level of thi background is
determin by the number of backscatt photon creat in each bunch cross as well as the number
of bunch cross over which the detector integr at tesla the bunch space is 337 ns and it might
be possibl to design the detector so that there would be onli one cross per detector readout in thi
case onli the underli interact from thi singl cross would need to be consid for the
nlc paramet consid here the bunch space is onli 28 ns as desir for oper in order
to maxim the bunch charg for the same total current in gener the detector will integr over a
number of bunch cross and it will therefor be desir to minim thi number thi may turn out
43
to be an import factor in determin the nlc detector design on the other hand although it may
onli be necessari to integr over one bunch cross at tesla the bunch charg will be roughli 30
higher and there will be more backscatt photon that can give rise to underli interact per
cross than for the nlc design thu a detail examin of thi background is requir in both the
tesla and nlc case in particular the perform of the btag and energi flow algorithm will be
critic and will depend upon the occup in the vertex detector and calorimet respect overal
our abil to reconstruct the twojet compon of the higg reson in the presenc of underli
soft jet structur from resolv photon interact is critic depend upon detector design featur
absent the requir studi in the context of a detail detector design we cannot current determin
whether the result resolv photon background will be a problem at either machin or which machin
will yield the smallest resolv photon background
we should note that our result have assum 80 polar for both the e beam use to backscatt the laser photon onli the cp studi would remain littl alter if one of the beam doe not
have substanti polar becaus of substanti increas background level compar result
for the other studiessearch would requir significantli more integr luminos if onli one beam ha
larg polar as a result if one is to be abl to perform these studi parasit dure normal
e e oper of the lc substanti e polar will be veri import anoth issu relat to
simultan studi e e collis and interact is the bunch space if the design 14 ns
bunch space for e e is employ then our luminos will be decreas by about 40

appendix b higherord correct
paper that have consid higher order qcd correct to higg product and the background cross
section and that have examin implic for higg detect includ 35 36 22 23 9 10 37 some
of the correct found in these paper are larg under certain circumst the purpos of thi appendix
is to explain whi these correct are rel small for the cut and the collid photon luminos
and polar predict by cain employ and to demonstr that it is much more import to
have as accur a simul as possibl in a realist experiment approach
let us discuss the background cross section first the treelevel jz 0 and jz 2 cross section
are given in eq 3 and 4 the m2q s suppress of the jz 0 background impli that radi
correct to thi compon of the cross section can be larg the exact magnitud of these correct
depend critic upon the laser beam configur in particular circular or linear and the precis cut
employ the radi correct are dramat reduc by employ cut that isol twojet final
state in the case of circularli polar laser beam if twojet final state are isol by employ
ycut 002 the first of the twojet cut we use the jz 0 background can still be increas rel to
45
the treelevel expect by up to a factor of 10 16 thi factor will be reduc by the addit backtoback cut that we employ which also discrimin against the radiat of an addit gluon at the
parton level but still might be larg in contrast radi correct to the jz 2 background cross
section are rel small
10 typic 16 for linearli polar laser beam the higherord
correct to the twojet final state are quit modest in size 37 thu the most import question
is whether or not we need to worri about the larg correct to the jz 0 background in the case of

anoth theoret issu concern the suppress factor associ with impos 2jet cut on
the signal
our approach ha been to gener the signal at treelevel but in the context of pan
dorapythiajetset which allow for the gener of extra jet via final state radiat the imposit of 2jet cut will then give rise to a suppress factor as comput in the context of pythiajetset
which factor is expect to be quit similar to that obtain from the analyt approach but will also
take into account experiment issu relat to jet definit detector resolut and so forth in thi
regard it is use to compar to ref 21 which follow an approach veri similar to our their fig 1
show that befor cut about 75 of the higg event have more than 2 jet use ycut 002 for the
same higg mass we obtain almost exactli the same result further we find that thi same percentag
appli also for higg mass in the 300 500 gev rang a correspond result is not given in 21 after
impos their cut in our case after cut especi the backtoback and co 05 cut we find
that roughli 90 95 of the event are 2jet for higg mass of 120 gev 400 gev
the final theoret issu that requir discuss is the possibl import of interfer between
signal and background here we refer to sever discuss in 10 first as shown in their eq 322 we
note that the interfer cross section onli involv the jz 0 part of the background sinc the higg
boson be consid are essenti produc onshel and sinc after cut the jz 0 background are
49
reduc to a level much smaller than the signal cross section such interfer will be small for exampl
10 see below eq 364 find that the interfer cross section is typic of order 1100 to 11000 of
the signal cross section after impos cut similar those we consid
