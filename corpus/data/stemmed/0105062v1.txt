the four lep experi aleph delphi l3 and opal have search for higg boson
predict by a larg number of extens of the standard model flavor independ search
are present for the h0 z0 process in which the h0 decay hadron search result are
also present for fermiophob higg boson invis decay higg boson charg higg
boson and the neutral higg boson in the mssm

introduct
sinc we have no experiment evid for the standard model sm higg particl we must
test more complic scenario beyond the sm sever extens of the sm introduc addit higg doublet and singlet 1 in thi work we present result on the 2hdm higgs the
2hdm is a minim extens of the sm in the sens that onli one addit doublet is introduc in the theori after the symmetri is broken the higg spectrum consist of five particl
two cpeven neutral scalar h0 and h0 a cpodd neutral scalar a0 and a charg pair h
the properti of the higg boson are defin by six free paramet four higg mass the
ratio of the vacuum expect valu of the two field tan and the mix angl in the
neutral cpeven sector the higg coupl with the boson and fermion control higg
product and decay particularli the higg coupl with the fermion must be limit
in order to suppress fcnc flavor chang neutral current at the tree level there are
exactli two possibl for the higg boson to coupl to the fermion onli one doublet coupl
with fermion and the other doe not coupl to quark or lepton and thi determin the
structur of the 2hdm of type i or one doublet coupl to downtyp fermion and the second
doublet coupl with the uptyp fermion and thi determin the structur of the 2hdm of
type ii

be suppress with respect to the sm valu while decay to charm quark or gluon pair are
enhanc therefor flavor independ search have been perform the experi have
updat their search for a scalar boson which is produc in associ with the z0 and which
decay hadron with a br 1 these analys use the same topolog as for the sm higg
boson search but do not make use of the btag in the absenc of a signal the result are usual
given in term of exclud region in the plane mh versu a sm cross section scale factor 2

fermiophob decay
fermiophob decay due to suppress coupl between the higg boson and the fermion
can appear in sever nonminim model as for exampl 2hdm of type i at mass below

invis decay
invis higg boson decay can appear in differ model as mssm majoron model model
with extradimens etc at lep energi it can be produc via the higgsstrahlung mechan e e h0 z0 follow by the decay of h0 into undetect final state the signatur
for such process are either 2 jet and miss energi in the event or a lepton pair and miss
