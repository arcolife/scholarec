abstract
in thi paper we review mani interest open problem in mathemat
physic which may be attack with the help of tool from construct field
theori they could give work for futur mathemat physicist train with
the construct method well within the 21st centuri
i
introduct
construct field theori start in the 70 as a program to studi the exist and properti of nontrivi particular interact field theori those
with simpl lagrangian inde it wa not obviou at that time that such
structur fulfil a suitabl set of axiom such as the wightman axiom
wi exist at all in three decad not onli model of field theori first
superrenormaliz then just renormaliz have been built and to some
extent analyz but also the method and techniqu develop in construct field theori have been appli to a wide varieti of problem outsid the
initi scope of the program construct techniqu have been appli to
equilibrium statist mechan particularli to the studi of critic phenomena and to disord system they have been introduc success
in the analysi of mani fermion model such as those of condens matter they have also inspir and renew studi in classic mechan and
in time depend problem such as nonequilibrium phenomena it is no
longer easi to draw the contour of thi nebula howev the initi group of
peopl who pioneer construct field theori in the earli 70 togeth with
1
a second and now a third gener of bright student although work in
veri differ domain nowaday still share in common a certain number of
featur they are usual faith to longterm program mayb even stubborn beyond the adject construct they share in common with the
construct trend in mathemat advoc for instanc by kroneck
a tast for explicit solut togeth with explicit bound rather than abstract exist theorem in principl thi mean that when translat into
algorithm and implement on comput the construct analysi of
a physic model can lead to quantiti comput with better precis and
better control accuraci
in thi review for the special issu of jmp of year 2000 we will be brief
on the success of the past and refer to the exist books1 instead we
will focu on the open problem conjectur and challeng that lie ahead
in a subject that could now perhap be call construct physic rather
than construct field theori and which remain character by the
rigor treatment of model issu from physic by hard analyt method
thi paper doe not contain ani equat it purpos is to entic the reader
to choos among the challeng problem just mention and then to go
for the refer where the formal for the correspond problem are
more precis defin final we apolog for the fact that the list of open
problem emphas inevit reflect our person bias and interest
i thank d brydg and j imbri for sever discuss and for their
hospit at the univers of virginia charlottesvil usa where a larg
part of thi paper wa written i thank also c kopper and v mastropietro
for sever discuss
ii
construct field theori
thi is the histor core of the theori and in spite of some spectacular
success it remain larg a mine of open problem
we recal that use the euclidean function integr approach model
of nontrivi interact field theori have been built over the past thirti
year which satisfi osterwalderschrad axiom henc in turn have a
1
for classic refer on construct field theori see ersigj1 for review on
construct renorm and the problem of asymtot complet see respect
r and ia and for the most recent proceed on construct field theori see cp
2
continu to minkowski space that satisfi wightman axiom wiosz
such model are unfortun yet restrict to spacetim dimens 2 or
3 but they includ now both the first wave of superrenormaliz model
such as p 2 gjs1gj1si 43 gj2fefom or the yukawa model
in 2 and 3 dimens as well as just renormaliz model such as the
massiv grossneveu model in two dimens or gn2 gk1fmrsdr1
most of these model have been built in the weak coupl regim use
expans such as the cluster and mayer expans the harder model
requir multiscal version of these expans reshuffl accord to the
renorm group philosophi
in most case the relationship of the nonperturb construct to the
perturb one ha been elucid the nonperturb green function
be the borel sum of the correspond perturb expans em
ms fmr
we identifi and discuss sever main area for futur progress
ii1
asymptot freedom four dimension model
by coleman theorem renormaliz asymptot free field theori
in dimens 4 must involv nonabelian gaug field howev these field
lead to dread infrar problem eg confin therefor no theori
satisfi the flat infinit volum wightman axiom in dimens 4 the
histor goal of construct field theori ha been construct yet howev in a finit volum balaban succeed in prove ultraviolet stabil
of the effect action for nonabelian lattic gaug theori after an arbitrarili larg number of renorm group step ba1 we mention
also a less advanc attempt to construct thi ultraviolet limit in a particular nonstandard gaug use gaug symmetri break cutoff mr thi
situat is not complet satisfi we list among open problem
ii11
nonlinear sigma model
construct the ultraviolet limit of the two dimension on non linear sigma
model which is a well behav asymptot free boson field theori see
eg gk2 for construct of the hierarch version of the model it is
quit irrit that we still do not have such a construct mani expert
3
in the field tri it without success the infrar mass gener ha been
obtain recent see kit
ii12
yangmil
construct the yang mill 4 correl function in a finit volum and a
standard gaug such as the landau gaug thi presum impli a
front attack on the gribov problem
simplifi and rewrit balaban result on the lattic gaug theori thi
is no small task sinc refer in ba1 total hundr of page
ii13
44
elucid the natur of 44 renorm pertub seri prove for instanc that renormalon do exist see dfr can one prove in full gener
that it ultraviolet limit is trivial a1frr
ii14
supersymmetr and topolog field theori
develop construct version of the nowpopular supersymmetr field theori and topolog field theori develop a construct understand of
montonenol dualiti in n 4 susi yangmills4 and of seibergwitten
dualiti for n 2 susi yangmills4
sinc these issu repres rather formid challeng it may be worth
to attack first some two dimension problem w1 polynomi henc superrenormaliz n 2 supersymmetr field theori allow the construct of interest quantiti sensit to topolog chang w2 then the
more difficult wesszuminowitten model at larg paramet k and the
calabiyau model are field theori in which the field take valu in a nontrivi manifold as target space
accord to the point of view of witten w1 develop construct
theori of function field theoret integr for these model could attract
more mathematician to field theori and may speed up the construct
program in other more tradit area too

ii2
strong coupl or low temperatur result
in the regim of strong coupl or low temperatur there are less result
contour expans have been use to prove the exist of the 42 phase
transit gjs2 mani result have been obtain for model with an
ultraviolet cutoff ie model inspir by field theori but which are truli
statist mechan model for instanc the phase transit and nonperturb mass gener ha been prove for the gn2 model with an
ultraviolet cutoff kmr and continu symmetri break in dimens
greater or equal to 3 ha been studi with renorm group techniqu ba2 an interest challeng would be to glue thi nontrivi
lowtemperatur analysi to the construct of the ultraviolet limit when
it is possibl sinc the weakcoupl expans for the ultraviolet limit is
somewhat in contradict with the lowtemperatur expans thi should
be done first for model with an other auxiliari small paramet such as
nvector model at larg n where the 1n expans can complet in the
infrar the small coupl expans in the ultraviolet
therefor the first problem to attack in that direct could be
ii21
construct dimension transmut
glue the ultraviolet analysi of the grossneveu model gk1fmrsdr1
with the nonperturb mass gener of the same model kmr at larg
n to obtain the first exampl of so call dimension transmut
one could also glue the ultraviolet construct of 43 to the infrar
continu symmetri break analysi of ba2 to control the larg ncompon 43 model in the continu symmetri broken phase without an
ultraviolet cutoff
ii22
construct conform field theori
develop rigor link between conform field theori in dimens two and
construct field theori along thi line the first signific result should
be to prove that the phase transit of 42 is in the same univers class
ie ha the same critic expon than the ise 2 phase transit thi
could be later extend to p 2 model with more vacua and pott model
more gener it should be nice to develop contact point between conform field theori in two dimens bpz the theori of integr system
5
which reli more onto algebra tool and construct theori which reli
more on analysi for instanc there exist integr lattic model of the
ade type which scale to conform field theori of the bpz classif
at their critic point pa can we find a model which can be built with
construct method for everi such conform theori
ii3
scatter asymptot complet and
minkowski space
develop phase space analysi and nonperturb method for field theori
that work directli in minkowski space thi should lead to first proof of
asymptot complet see ia for quantum field theori model
the easiest model in thi direct may be the grossneveu model sinc
it is pure perturb although it is justrenormaliz henc ha
a wors ultraviolet power count than 42 it can be written pure as a
reshuffl perturb seri dr1 so that in order to build it directli in
minkowski space one doe not need to develop a theori of function integr in minkowski space base on stationari phase analysi it should be
enough to simpli develop a renorm group analysi around the mass
shell hyperbola which should resembl the renorm group around the
fermi surfac of section iv
ii4
other problem
complet in full detail the construct of the first non renormaliz field
theori the grossneveu model in three dimens and larg number of compon dcfdvmsdv construct other model of thi type for instanc
the correspond regim of the sinegordon model
develop construct field theori in curv spacetim
make better contact with the c algebra approach sometim call axiomat field theori we refer to bv for a point of view on the renorm group in algebra field theori

equilibrium statist mechan
in thi categori we alreadi mention the construct studi of continu
symmetri break ba2 and dimension transmut in subsect ii21
iii1
coulomb gase
after proof of deby screen and kosterlitz thouless kt phase transit thi area togeth with the studi of the sinegordon and thir
model remain veri activ among constructivist for background in thi
subject we refer to bm here is a list of open problem for which we thank
d brydg
iii11
find a direct proof of converg of the mayer expans for dipol at
low activ which doe not use a cluster expans the dipoledipol
interact should be smooth at short distanc so that it is stabl
iii12
converg of the mayer expans at low activ for the kt phase of the
2d coulomb ga thi is harder than the previou problem and involv
presum an effect analysi of that ga in term of multipol
iii13
prove exponenti screen in the 2d coulomb ga at not particularli small
temperatur down to the kt transit
iii14
control the correl at the kt transit
iii15
are the transit between kt and 12kt in the d2 coulomb ga visibl
in ani correl

iii2
disord system
the proof by j imbri that the three dimension random field ise model
develop symmetri break at zero temperatur im remain a beauti
exampl in which rigor construct method have solv a controversi
physic issu disord system are common in natur conductor or
semiconductor with structur defect or dope spin glass real glass
granular or porou media etc they pose particularli challeng mathemat problem and we review here onli a few of them
iii21
anderson model of an electron in a random potenti
here after the main result of fs2 and follow on the local regim
at high disord or out of the continu spectrum of the free hamiltonian
we feel that the main area for open problem is the weakcoupl phase
it is expect that the anderson 2 model and2 is alway local but with
exponenti small local length when the coupl constant tend to
0 a proof of thi statement through construct field theori method seem
to requir first the proof of decay of a singl averag green function
g on a scale proport to 2 the squar of the coupl constant thi
also control the densiti of state of the system a construct analysi is
under way base on sector decomposit as in fmrt1 a random matrix
analog and ward ident mpr1 then the real studi of local
involv the studi of g g and requir a resumm of lead
ladder plu a studi of the associ goldston mode therefor the
whole program is certainli as hard to complet as the bcs2 program for
interact fermion defin in section iv below
in dimens 3 one expect the small coupl phase to be diffus henc
the system should undergo an anderson mott phase transit from insul to conduct at a certain critic coupl to prove thi one should
again first control the decay on a length scale of 2 of a singl averag
green function thi seem much harder than in dimens 2 essenti for
the same reason that bcs3 is much harder than bcs2 the random potenti
view as a random matrix between angular direct is not of the usual
type ie is not independ ident distribut see mpr2 after that
difficulti ha been solv howev the task of control the squar modulu of the green function g g should be easier than in dimens
8
2 sinc we expect diffus rather than local
iii22
construct studi of spin glass
thi area is not familiar to me but it contain certainli veri challeng
problem which do not often belong to the cultur of main stream constructivist to solv in a construct sens model like the sherringtonkirckpatrik model is certainli an ambiti goal for the futur one should
understand the correct notion of state for the model in particular in connexion with the ultrametr structur conjectur by the physicist it would
be fascin to also understand in a more precis and construct sens
the replica symmetri break tool of parisi recent an explicit formula
for the partit function at low temperatur ha been obtain kou
iii3
polym
polym and selfavoid walk saw are relat to zerocompon field
theori and have been often studi by construct theorist among the
establish result are the work a2bshslim which explor the behavior of these system in 4 dimens or more scale dimens of saw
with specif interact in two dimens can also be studi rigor
through conform invari see d for a recent result in thi area use
quantum graviti method
here is a list of open problem
iii31
polym with partli attract interact prove that they scale to brownian motion in d 4 at least if the interact is stabl and small exist
of transit when the interact is stabl but attract
iii32
d 4 self avoid walk find new proof that the endtoend distanc ha
an expon of 12 with log correct
9
iii33
find new proof that random walk in random environ scale to brownian
motion in d 2
iii34
prove anyth at all about the expect endto end distanc of a self avoid
walk in d 4 is it greater than that of simpl random walk doe it have
an expon if it doe is the expon differ from 12
iii35
prove that the scale limit of true self avoid walk in d 2 is brownian
motion
iii4
interfac wulff construct
the construct studi of function integr associ to interact surfac polyakov function integr is much harder than the ordinari random walk the import of these function integr for instanc in
string theori nevertheless justifi that constructivist should get interest
into them
iii41
wet
the studi of interfac is more advanc for solidon solid model than for
real model such as the ise model in the two phase regim
an import open problem is to construct the nontrivi renorm group fix point for a solidonsolid model of an interfac with two
compet exponenti thi should be doabl at least in the regim where
thi fix point is close to a gaussian one thank to a small paramet in
the rate of the two exponenti bhl
an other import problem is to give rigor mean to the wulff
construct for such model dm
there are also perturb result on the renorm surfac interact eg with a singl impur ddg which one would like to connect to
a construct analysi
10
iii5
non equilibrium statist mechan
the studi of situat far from equilibrium made a big conceptu progress
with the introduct of the srb steadi state srb a typic recent rigor result in thi domain is the fluctuat theorem of gallavotti and cohen
gc on entropi product see g1 for a discuss of thi result
we remark that the quantum nonequilibrium statist mechan remain a wide open subject an import long term goal for construct
theori should be after mani bodi system are better understood and the
main problem of the next section iv are solv to develop the correspond
theori near equilibrium namley to put on a firm mathemat microscop
analysi the kubo formula and the joul effect and more gener transport
theori
iv
condens matter
in the construct theori of condens matter the main event of the past
wa the adapt of renorm group techniqu to model with a
fermi surfac bgft12fmrt15
iv1
interact fermion in 2 dimens
in two dimens there is a welldefin strategi which should lead ultim to the complet construct of the bcs2 model name the control
of the bc phase at zero temperatur fmrt5 there exist alreadi a control of the model until a scale where the coupl constant becom small
but of order uniti which prove that ani transit temperatur ha to be
exponenti small in the coupl dr23 then the zone where the coupl constant is of order uniti should be under control through some kind
of 1n expans where here n is no longer an ad hoc paramet but is
the effect number of angular direct on the fermi surfac at the scale
consid fmrt2 thi expans is not easi to write and one may start
with a simpler model which ha onli quartic interact at the bc scale
like in kmr then one ha to glue thi analysi to the previou one henc
treat the correct to the quartic effect action final one ha to control the distanc scale much longer that the bc scale where the physic
is govern by the infrar singular of the goldston boson here the
11
key tool should be a multiscal renorm group analysi that reli on
ward ident fmrt4 like in ba2 thi is a long and difficult program
even by the construct standard
iv2
interact fermion in 3 dimens bcs3
in dimens 3 the bc program is less advanc although perturb
power count for the fermi liquid is independ of dimens and the
goldston boson problem is easier in 31 than in 21 dimens the initi
regim the equival of fmrt1dr2 is harder to control for bcs3
becaus the momentum conserv law are not as restrict in 3 than
in 2 dimens vertic can be nonplanar or twist in 3 dimens
fmrt3 the onli rigor result so far is that the radiu of converg
of perturb theori in a slice around the fermi surfac is independ
of the distanc of that slice to the singular mr to find the analog of
fmrt1dr2 name that the sum of all converg contribut to the
theori is analyt in the coupl constant remain in our opinion a major
challeng of construct theori
iv3
boseeinstein condens
develop the theori of boseeinstein condens thi can be view as a
piec of the previou bc program where the boson are cooper pair ie
bound state of fermion or as an independ program if the boson are
given from the start see be
iv4
nonspher surfac hubbard model
iv41
treat nonspher surfac after the work on the renorm of convex
surfac fkltfst treat surfac with flat piec andor singular point
the regular hubbard model at halffil on a squar lattic ha both these
featur until now thi ha to reli for at least some part on numer
rather than analyt tool
12
iv42
develop a rigor nonperturb meanfield theori for condens matter
ie develop the nonperturb version of the dynam meanfield or
d limit of model such as the hubbard model thi dynam meanfield model is realli a one dimension theori with a selfconsist condit
but without an explicit action gkkr
iv5
quasiperiod potenti quasicryst
develop the mathemat theori of conduct in quasicryst
in one dimens it is believ that fermion develop a charg densiti
wave instabl at small temperatur with period equal to the invers of
the densiti an interest goal is to prove the gener of such cdw in a
system of interact fermion in thi direct an expans for interact
fermion with an incommensur extern potenti satisfi a proper diophantin condit wa shown to converg in ma thi is a first bridg on
the gap between solid state physic and classic mechan the kam theorem below sinc it amount to solv a small denomin problem with
loop it would be nice to extend thi bridg to other model in particular
in greater dimens
v
classic mechan
again thi is an area i do not fell too compet to review and my remark
will be brief contribut from construct theorist have been devot in
particular to the area of the kam theorem where in particular the italian
school around g gallavotti ha develop the renorm group approach to the kam theorem but also to classic and quantum chao and
to classic mechan in random environ
v1
kam theori
invari tori in hamiltonian system analyt close to integr system
can be written as perturb lindstedt seri in the perturb paramet a direct proof of the converg of such seri done by eliasson e
can be also obtain in the quantum field theori languag use multiscal
13
analysi as in the renorm group and cancel g2 these
cancel can be interpret as ward ident relat to translat invari bgk1
an interest open question is what happen to lindstedt seri in the
nonanalyt case moser by use nash theorem prove that kam tori
exist also in thi case with suitabl condit but in gener they are not
analyt in bggm analyt wa nevertheless prove for a class of nonanalyt pertub by direct analysi of new cancel in the lindstedt
seri in more gener case where the summabl of lindstedt seri may
fail it is an open question to know if some extend notion of summabl
like borel summabl quit frequent in quantum field theori may still
hold
anoth set of problem concern arnold diffus in a priori unstabl
system a key quantiti is the split which is the determin of a certain
matrix whose element are seri whose first order is exponenti small
but the other are not howev the determin itself is exponenti small
due to cancel use dyson equat for classic mechan arnold
diffus can be prove in certain a priori stabl system ggm but the
same question is open in gener a priori stabl system such as those aris
from celesti mechan
v2
classic chao turbul
of cours the solut of navierstok equat and their scale law remain a challeng pretti much as it wa at the begin of the centuri
in the fulli develop turbul experiment observ deviat from
kolmogorov scale of the veloc correl signal a nongaussian charact of the veloc distribut at short distanc call intermitt
such intermitt or deviat from kolmogorov scale ha been more
or less understood in the particular case of the passiv advect of a scalar
quantiti temperatur or densiti of a pollut by a random veloc field
gk3bgk2 howev an explan of the origin of intermitt in the
gener case of develop turbul remain one of the main open problem
of theoret hydrodynam
14
v3
quantum chao
here let us mention the result crr on the gutzwil trace formula that
one would like to extend to longer time evolut a main challeng is to put
the heurist connect between quantum chao and the spectra of random
matric on a mathemat rigor foot
v4
partial differenti equat and renorm
i would like to cite the work of bricmont and kupiainen on random walk in
a random environ bk1 and more gener the applic of renorm group method to partial differenti equat bk2
the major open problem list in bk2 are the studi of stabil of
front in dissip equat extens of renorm group method to
hyperbol equat the studi of invari measur for dynam system
call coupl map lattic ka and of nonequilibrium phase transit
in which these invari measur chang as the coupl is vari
vi
improv construct techniqu
in thi section we would like to gather some list of mathemat techniqu
which are quit gener so that they ought to be use not onli for a singl
problem but for mani model in differ branch of physic
vi1
renorm group
a central problem in construct theori is to simplifi and further ration the variou techniqu which allow to perform rigor renorm
group comput the induct version of the renorm group
itself ha been better formal by brydg and cowork br the multiscal phase space expans which are some kind of expand solut of
the renorm group induct have been also recent formal more
explicitli ar and also recast use wavelet bat these effort should
be continu if we want the rigor approach to becom part of the regular cursu of field theori an open problem which could be mention along
15
these line is to find an induct rigor construct renorm which
would be as simpl as polchinski induct for perturb renorm
p even for fermion thi remain an open problem s2dr1
vi2
glu togeth variou expans
techniqu to glue togeth differ expans or differ regim of the
renorm group eg small coupling1n coupl should be develop thi is a condit to treat mani interest model with nonperturb phase somewhat like the geometr descript of nontrivi
manifold requir to glue sever local chart togeth the construct of
nontrivi model with nonperturb effect requir to develop some
experi in such glu oper see ii21
in a similar vein it is interest to combin togeth sever expans
techniqu which are usual treat separ for instanc one can studi
the mani bodi model of section iv with the addit complic of
random or quasiperiod environ see ma for a onedimension exampl
vi3
symmetri and ward ident
mani difficult construct problem involv symmetri which are crucial to
their understand gaug symmetri supersymmetri replica symmetri
one would like to have more gener method to quotient out or break these
symmetri and develop a more gener theori of nonperturb ward
ident
vi4
noninteg dimens
noninteg dimens is an interest perturb tool eg for the renorm of nonabelian gaug field or for the expans in statist mechan that ha no construct analog one should understand
whi and build the nonperturb theori of function integr in noninteg dimens thi is a longterm difficult goal perhap relat to
noncommut geometri where ordinari space is lost and the ordinari
algebra of function is replac by a noncommut algebra
16
vi5
random matric
random matric is a power tool for a wide rang of physic problem
from nuclear physic to quantum chao local quantiz graviti and
mtheori the classic theori is the theori of independ ident distribut random matric and relat them to orthogon polynomi and
integr pde m an import progress may come from the understand of random matric with nonindepend coeffici in the point
of view of voiculescu v the wigner law for independ ident distribut matric model is the noncommut analog of gaussian integr constructivist just as they develop the theori of nongaussian
function integr may therefor tri to develop a more gener theori of
random matric includ in particular those with constraint of geometr
origin see eg mpr2 for an exampl thi could presum be veri use for the physic in spatial dimens higher than 2 condens matter
scatter phase transit
vii
string theori and conclus
when the construct field theori program began in the 60 field theori
wa the promin candid for a fundament theori of natur at the microscop level although it did not includ quantiz of graviti today
the main stream of theoret physic hold the view that field theori is onli
an effect theori and that superstr or mtheori is the best candid
for a fundament global theori of natur a theori of everyth even if
on a philosoph level the veri exist of such a final theori is dubiou
it is certainli a fascin dream so in order to remain faith to it initi
quest one could ask whether constructivist should not join the effort to
find and build thi toe
i would be tempt to adopt a rather cautiou answer to thi question
name perhap but not yet there are three reason for thi cautiou
attitud
string theori or mtheori are mathemat veri difficult even the
perturb theori of superstr amplitud contain enorm difficulti
a proof of finit eg of the 10dimension e8 e8 heterot superstr
amplitud is a veri difficult program in itself
17
the theori is in such a state of rapid evolut that it is not clear what
should realli be built in the recent year the differ model had a rather
short life time befor they were absorb in a more gener formal under
such circumst to launch a major construct effort could be prematur
sinc the model might be outdat well befor the rigor construct is
complet
the theori ha not yet receiv direct experiment confirm we
can at best hope for indirect hint which may come in the next decad
spatial experi such as those probe the background cosmic radiat
larg cosmic ray detector new acceler such as the lhc etc may
select along variou cosmolog or high energi scenarii and give indirect
support to such or such model
for these three reason i do not think that time is ripe to launch today
construct string theori as construct field theori wa launch by
a wightman and follow in the 60
to soften slightli these remark let me add that of cours i consid
string theori extrem import for the futur of mathemat physic
inde string theori ha not onli been a veri success motiv to attract some of the best mind to theoret physic and to lead them to
brilliant insight it ha also open up a new interfac with mathematician
mostli center around geometri differenti symplect and algebra geometri mirror symmetri quantum cohomolog knot theori howev
thi rapidli grow interfac is veri differ from the one open in the
past by construct theori algebra and geometri domin over analysi
and there are no longer precis program center around axiom but variou
piec of the theori and variou crossconsist result emerg progress
from thi interact between mathematician and theoret physicist
in conclus although at the present stage i would still rather person
favor the applic of construct field theori method to well establish
physic i would be happi when some of the dust ha settl to see new
gener of mathemat physicist attack in the construct spirit the
problem of build rigor the high energi model that will emerg and
surviv in the come centuri
