thi paper contain a thorough studi of the trigonometri of the homogen
symmetr space in the cayleykleindickson famili of space of complex hermitian
type and rankon the complex hermitian ellipt cp n su n 1u 1
su n and hyperbol ch n su n 1u 1 su n space their analogu
with indenit hermitian metric su p 1 qu 1 su p q and the noncompact
symmetr space sln 1 rso1 1 sln r are the gener member in thi
famili the remain space are some contract of the former
the method encapsul trigonometri for thi whole famili of space into a singl
basic trigonometr group equat and ha univers and selfdual as it
distinct trait all previous known result on the trigonometri of cp n and
ch n follow as particular case of our gener equat
the follow topic are cover rather explicitli 0 descript of the complet

introduct
in a previou paper 1 the trigonometri of the complet famili of symmetr space of rank
one and real type wa studi these space are also call cayleyklein hereaft ck
real space and were rst discuss by klein extend the cayley idea of project metric in two dimens there are nine real space with a real quadrat symmetr metric
of ani posit zero neg constant curvatur and ani posit denit degener
indenit signatur 2 further to thi the paper 1 had a long run aim toward open
an avenu for explor the trigonometri of gener symmetr homogen space
next to the space of real type there are space of complex type in complex
dimens n there are 3n 1 such geometri 3 complex type mean here that these
space are coordinatis by element of a onestep extens of r through a label
cayleydickson procedur r r which adjoin a imaginari unit i with i2 to r
produc either the complex dual or split complex number accord as 0 0 0
we will term cayleykleindickson ckd these space they are hermitian sinc they
are relat to a scalar product with complex valu and hermitianlik symmetri
within thi famili onli the space coordinatis by ordinari complex number where
0 which can be rescal to 1 and i2 1 are actual complex space after thi
restrict there are onli 3n ck complex type geometri in complex dimens n 4
for n 2 there are nine 2d complex hermitian ck space with constant holomorph
curvatur either khol 0 0 0 and a hermitian metric of either denit degener
or indenit signatur all these are hermitian symmetr space with a complex structur
henc k
ahlerian but onli the three space with a denit posit hermitian metric belong
to the restrict famili of the socal twopoint homogen space 6 these are the
ellipt hermitian space ie the complex project space cp 2 with the fubinistudi
metric the hermitian hyperbol space ch 2 which can be realiz in the interior of a
hermitian quadric in cp 2 like it real analogu and the hermitian euclidean space cr2
a twodimension hilbert space as the common limit space
if degener and indenit hermitian product are allow a ck famili of nine complex 2d space is obtain the complex ellipt euclidean and hyperbol hermitian plane
with a denit posit metric the complex coeuclidean galilean and cominkowskian or
anti newtonhook galilean and newtonhook hermitian plane with a degener
metric and nalli the indenit metric complex cohyperbol minkowskian and doubli
hyperbol or anti de sitter minkowskian and de sitter hermitian plane the last six
space are the complex hermitian analogu of the three nonrelativist and three relativist spacetim in group theoret term all these nine hermitian space appear as
four gener case and five nongener one within the complex ck famili the gener
case are su 3u 1 su 2 su 2 1u 1 su 2 su 2 1u 1 su 1 1
the last host two dierent space with time like and spacelik complex line interchang nongener case are contract of these four gener one with either
curvatur vanish metric degener or both within the full complex ck famili of
space of complex type result on trigonometri are onli avail as far as we know for
the hermitian space with denit posit metric and constant either posit or neg holomorph curvatur 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 a review of these result is includ
in section 2
the space in the subfamili 0 are much less known they have not a complex struc
2
ture but it split complex analogu it gener member correspond to the symmetr
homogen space sl3 rso1 1 sl2 r and the nongener one to some of
it contract the trigonometri for such space ha appar not been studi the
space with 0 appear as common contract from the space with 0 and 0
in thi paper we set out the task of studi in full detail the trigonometri of the complet famili of space of complex type it clearli suce to consid the twodimension
case as a triangl in ani ckd such complextyp space in complex dimens n is
fulli contain in a total geodes subspac with complex dimens 2
the approach distinct trait are first it cover at onc the trigonometri in the
whole famili of 33 27 such geometri parametr by three real label 1 2 the
studi of the trigonometri in the famili as a whole is in fact easier than it studi for just
one space at a time second it give a clear view of sever dualiti relationship between
the trigonometri of these dierent space in particular it explic display the selfdual
of the hermitian ellipt space analog to the selfdual of the real sphere s 2 that is
complet hidden in the trigonometr equat deriv for thi space in 9 10 11 13
third it give more than previous known all previous known equat appear as a
rather small subset of the equat to be deriv here fourth it deal uniformli with the
contract nongener case which correspond to curvatur vanish 1 0 andor
fubinistudi metric degener 2 0 or 0 hermitian analogu of the real
angular and later excess vanish in these limit and are relat to triangl symplect
area and it dual quantiti and fifth the presenc of the addit cayleydickson type
label make it possibl the consider of a new type of contract encompass by
the limit 0 whose physic mean is worth explor
the paper is intend to be selfcontain but refer to 1 may be help special
for motiv and gener background a condens review of alreadi known result on
the trigonometri of both the hermitian ellipt and hyperbol space 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
is given in section 2 here we display the basic equat which in some case were
origin given in term of angular invari not consid in thi paper eg the fubinistudi angl and the holomorphi inclin at each vertex and will be rewriten here
so they can be easili identi with the one we obtain the choic of basic invari
adopt here aord the equat in a form which we believ simpler than use ani
other choic
inform on ckd space of complex type is given in section 3 and 4 section
3 deal with the ordinari complex case and therefor refer to a much more familiar
situat section 4 comment the main new trait appear when complex number are
replac by their complex parabol and split hyperbol version
in section 5 the approach to the trigonometri propos in 1 is develop in depth for
the complet ckd famili the whole of trigonometri for all these space is encapsul
in a singl basic trigonometr group equat involv side angl and later and
angular phase and exhibit explicitli selfdual in the whole famili thi is mainli
achiev due to a choic of triangl invari as the canon paramet of two pair
of commut isometri a choic which should ring a bell to ani physicist educ in
quantum mechan deal with mani space at onc thi equat give a perspect
on some relationship go far beyond ani treatment devot to the studi of a singl
space the behaviour of trigonometri when either the curvatur vanish or the metric
degener is explicitli describ through the ckd constant 1 2 dualiti is the
3
main structur backbon in our approach and the requir to explicitli maintain
dualiti in all express and at all stage act as a kind of method ngerprint cartan
dualiti for symmetr space 14 appear here as the chang of sign in either 1 or 2
the basic trigonometr group equat is an equat for the parameterdepend
group of motion by write it in the fundament complex represent a set of nine
complex equat follow with these equat as start point we will explor in
section 6 the rather unknown territori of complex hermitian trigonometr equat
the background provid by real trigonometri make thi explor easier by deliber pursu the analog while at the same time the relev dierenc stand out
clearli the most interest dierenc with real trigonometri is the natur split of
the equat into two sector the rst involv quantiti link to cartan gener
of the motion group where two new triangl invari appear in a rather natur way
they play a special import role sinc they are proport to the symplect area and
coarea of the triangl for the hermitian ellipt space cp 2 these quantiti were rst
found by blasckh and terheggen 7 8 the other sector is the complex analogu of the
whole real trigonometr set of equat most result in the real case have sometim
sever andor partli analog in thi complex trigonometri the famili form of all
previous known equat is obtain here togeth with a larg number of new one
in the cp 2 case 1 1 1 2 1 all trigonometr function of side angl later
and angular phase are the ordinari circular one and at a rst look the whole paper can
be read by restrict to thi case thi may help to grasp the key idea while not lose
view of the increas scope aord by the possibl of zero or neg 1 or 2
the basic trigonometr ident for the famili of complex hermitian space is also
directli link to other product formula which we believ new they can be consid as
a kind of complex hermitian gaussbonnet formula and contain the total of complex
hermitian trigonometri in a nutshel as they are equival to the basic trigonometr
ident the subject of such exponenti product formula appear as an step in our
deriv section 51 but it can be further develop by itself and aord a number
of new ident thi will be discuss elsewher
there is actual a strong link between thi studi which superci seem like a work
in geometri and physic the mathemat structur underli the quantum state space
belong to the complex hermitian ckd famili so as a byproduct of thi work we obtain
the basic equat of the trigonometri of the quantum state space 15 16 ani hilbert
space appear in the ckd famili as a hermitian euclidean space thu with label
1 1 0 2 3 1 and it project hilbert space which play in ani quantum
theori the role of space of state appear as the hermitian ellipt space 1 1
0 2 3 1 geometr phase are relat to trigonometr quantiti for the
simplest triangl type loop in the quantum state space the anandanaharonov phase
appear intriguingli as one of the triangl invari introduc by blaschk and terheggen
sixti year ago the paper by sudarshan ananadan and govindarajan 17 give a group
theoret deriv of the anandanaharonov phase equal to triangl symplect area
for an innitesim triangl loop in cp n thi result appear as a particular case of our
exact express link triangl element for ani finit triangl the role of symplect
area for geodes triangl in connect with coher state and geometr phase ha
also been recent discuss by berceanu 18 and boya perelomov and santand 19 a
separ more physic orient paper 20 will be devot to the trigonometri of the
quantum space of state in relat with geometr phase and in gener with the view

a review on hermitian trigonometri of cp 2 and ch 2
the hermitian ellipt space ie cp n endow with the natur fubinistudi fs metric
induc by the real part of the hermitian canon at product in cn 1 is an homogen
hermitian symmetr space it ha a natur complex structur and the fs metric is
kahlerian and ha constant holomorph curvatur the k
ahler form is induc by the
imaginari part of the hermitian canon metric in cn 1 22 the standard choic of
scale in the metric make the maximum distanc in cp n equal to 2 and the total
length of ani close geodes equal to with thi choic the constant holomorph
curvatur of cp n is khol 4 the ordinari section curvatur k of the fs metric in
cp n seen as a riemannian space of real dimens 2n is not constant and lie in the
interv 1 k 4 complex project geometri wa studi by cartan 23 build
over the work by studi 24 and fubini 25
for the real project space rp n trigonometri essenti reduc to spheric trigonometri 26 the homogen symmetr charact of cp n make also possibl an
explicit studi of it trigonometri which is howev much more complic than for
rp n a common trait in most of the previou work on hermitian trigonometri is to
introduc a singl real invari for each side which seem natur as cp n is a rank one
space but two real invari for each vertex which also seem natur due to presenc of
two commut factor in the group theoret descript of the hermitian ellipt space
as the homogen space su n 1u 1 su n
for side invari the canon choic are the distanc in the fs metric a resp b c
between vertic bc resp ca ab to avoid nongener special case all paper quot
befor enforc the restrict a b c 2 thi mean that each pair of side doe not meet
the cut locu of the common vertex in both the ellipt hermitian space cp n and the
hermitian hyperbol space ch n identi with a suitabl bound domain of cp n with
the hyperbol fs metric each point z is a ray in the linear ambient space cn 1 11 even
if we assum normal the ambient posit vector z z 1 everi ray in cn 1 still
contain innit mani normal vector dier onli by a phase factor z ei z
let za zb zc denot arbitrarili chosen normal posit vector in cn 1 dene up
to a phase factor for the three vertic a za b zb c zc then the length a
of the side a bc can be obtain from the hermitian product of the two normal
vector zb zc in the ambient linear space through co a expia zb zc the phase
a is not a triangl invari as the vector repres the vertic can be still modi
by arbitrari phase factor
vertex invari are dene in term of the tangent space to the hermitian space
which will be consid here as a real vector space with a complex structur at each
point a vector tangent to a geodes g is dene onli up to a nonzero real factor the
tangent space to a complex project line l at a point o is a real 2d subspac of
the tangent space invari under the complex structur and can be thu identi to a
complex 1d subspac thi subspac contain a oneparamet famili of real 1d subspac
correspond to a oneparamet famili of fs geodes through o and contain in l
for vertex invari sever real quantiti can be use in term of the tangent vector
u v to two real onedimension fs geodes side at the vertex c these are 1 the
5
hermitian angl between the side seen as complex project line denot c 2 the
ordinari or fs angl between u v comput as usual in the natur riemannian fs
metric in cp n or ch n 27 g re 3 the fs angl between iu v denot
here these are dene as
c arcco
u v
u v
re u v
u v
arcco
im u v
u v
arcco
21
note 2 is the minimum valu of the riemannian fs angl between the tangent
vector u and a total geodes rp 2 contain the geodes with tangent vector v
in addit to yet not independ from these one can consid also 4 the holomorphi
inclin of the real 2at tangent to the triangl at the vertex c also call k
ahler
angl inclin angl holomorphi angl slant angl etc between u and v 28 thi
quantiti depend onli on the real 2at determin by u and v and not on u v separ
thu the name holomorphi inclin or k
ahler inclin seem more appropri in
term of two vector u t which span the given 2plane and are furthermor fs orthogon
the holomorphi inclin is given by
arcco
re iu t
u t
where t u v
r
re u t 0
22
the holomorphi inclin measur how thi real 2at separ from the uniqu real
2at cu contain u and invari under the complex structur the fs angl between iu
and t is a natur measur of the separ between these two 2plane sinc cu u iu
and the given 2plane is span by u t both pair are fs orthogon final 5 anoth
angular invari of the pair of tangent vector u v it pseudoangl or kasner angl
28 is
u v u v ei
23
thi angl ha not been explicitli use in previou work on trigonometri on cp n or
ch n it is gener well dene for ani two vector in the tangent space at each point
of cp n or ch n ie between two intersect fs geodes with tangent vector u v
at the intersect point but becom indetermin when u v are fs orthogon the
angular invari is obvious meaningless between complex line in these space
to sum up there are sever dierent choic avail for two independ vertex
invari see the review by scharnhorst 28 author studi trigonometri have made
dierent choic and the follow relat will be use for compar the propos
trigonometr equat there are of cours similar relat for the correspond angular

trigonometri in the hermitian space cp 2 and ch 2

the paper by blaschk and terheggen 1939 7 8 hereaft bt contain the
rst complet approach to trigonometri in the ellipt hermitian space identi with
cp 2 unlik the phase a of zb zc which is meaningless as a quantiti in cp 2 the
combin a b c is a triangl invari as can be clearli seen in the relat
za zb zb zc zc za co a co b co c expi bt name thi quantiti but for
the reason explain below we will chang thi notat to let us now consid the
normal posit vector za zb zc of the pole za zb zc of the three side
b
c
a b c dene by bt in the ambient space c3 through a vector product as za z sinza
and cyclic where the vector product is dene exactli as in the real case without
complex conjug in ani factor then the dual procedur co a expia zb zc
and a b c appli to the pole of the three side produc four invari
three angl a b c between side seen as complex line and anoth quantiti which
wa call by bt these four quantiti are dual to a b c bt gave a complet set
of equat for the hermitian ellipt space trigonometri one is the coolidg sine
law 27 and there are two new equat which we will call blaschketerheggen cosin
theorem for side and angl the need of four quantiti eg a b c to determin a
triangl up to isometri in the ellipt hermitian space follow from these equat

anoth approach wa put forward by shirokov in a paper publish posthum by
rosenfeld shirokov took two angular invari at each vertex the riemannian fs angl
c between the two side a b consid as real1d fs geodes and the holomorphi
inclin c of the real 2at span at the vertex c by the real tangent vector to
the two side a b the equat which we shall call shirokovrosenfeld sr form of
sine theorem doubl sine theorem for side cosin theorem for side and doubl cosin
theorem for side respect are

as well as similar cosin and doubl cosin equat for the side b c among all these
equat onli five are function independ for instanc 212 and 213 are equival note sr sine theorem 210 is equival to the coolidg sine law as consequ

in 1989 wuyi hsiang 10 gave a new deriv valid simultan for the trigonometri of the twopoint homogen rankon space of real complex quaternion and
cayley octonion type both ellipt and hyperbol at each vertex say c hsiang use
the three invari c c c link by a relat 26 recal c 2 c in the
elliptichiperbol case he obtain some equat which when translat to c c c
are given below in 214 215 as well as a rather complic form of cosin theorem
not reproduc here and that should not be consid as a basic equat
in 1990 brehm 11 gave a fresh approach to trigonometri of both ellipt cp n and
hyperbol ch n hermitian space in term of three angular invari c c c onli
two of which are independ brehm deriv the follow equat

the rst two equat are coolidg sine law and the hsiang form of doubl sine law the
third one turn out to be simpli the shirokovrosenfeld cosin doubl theorem for side
express in term of brehm angular variabl the need of four quantiti to determin
a triangl up to isometri in cp n or ch n wa stress by brehm who introduc the shape
invari of the triangl dene in the ellipt case as re za zb zb zc zc za
co a co b co c co and as cosh a cosh b cosh c co in the hyperbol case brehm
show a triangl is complet determin up to isometri by a b c recal in the ellipt
case brehm assum a b c 2 and gave inequ that must be fulll in order
the triangl to exist as well as a care discuss on congruenc theorem
in 1994 hangan and masala 29 gave an interpret of in the complex project
space cp 2 as equal to twice the symplect area enclos by the triangl symplect area
come from the k
ahler structur of cp 2 and is well dene by the triangl skelethon
itself due to the close natur of the k
ahler form which make the symplect area of ani
surfac with given boundari to depend onli on the boundari
the exist of two distinguish non gener type of triangl is clear in cp 2
when a 0 then b c 0 follow and the trigonometri equat reduc to those
of a spheric triangl in a sphere of curvatur k 4 thi is seen in 211 and 213 and
correspond to a triangl complet contain in a complex line cp 1 when a 2
then b c 2 the equat reduc local to those of a spheric triangl in
curvatur k 1 thi can be seen in 210 and 212 and correspond to a triangl
complet contain in a real project subplan rp 2 whose trigonometri come from
the spheric one after antipod ident thi case correspond to real valu for
expi and expi as impli by the blaschketerhegen equat 28 and 29
in these two special case contain in a total geodes submanifold whose section
curvatur attain the extrem valu 1 and 4 in all other situat the triangl is not

the compat condit for a triangular loop
in thi section we discuss the approach to the trigonometri of the twenti seven complex
hermitian type ckd space and we introduc the complex hermitian compat
equat loop equat and the basic trigonometr ident some gener comment
on thi approach are given in 1 and will not be repeat here special we refer to the
choic of extern angl at the vertex a and the fact that the standard angular excess
appear without the explicit presenc of the measur of twice a quadrant of angl which
equal when 2 1
a triangl in a complex hermitian ckd space can be seen either as a triangl point
loop or dualli as a triangl line loop see gure 3 in the rst case a point c is consid
to move to a dierent point b translat either along the geodes segment cb or along
the two geodes segment ca and ab dualli the geodes c ab is consid to move
to a dierent geodes b ca rotat either about the vertex a bc or about the
vertic b ca and then c ab there exist though a veri import dierenc
with the real 2d case the translat along a geodes are not uniqu dene by the
geodes onli thu to make out sens of the idea of triangl loop a closer analysi of the
geometri is requir ani geodes g through c determin a well dene complex line
c g contain g thu for the two geodes a b intersect at the vertex c there are
two uniqu determin complex line c a c b through c these two complex line

dual to the determin of a gener well dene geodes ga through two dierent

to start with the studi of trigonometri we will take as side and angl the canon paramet of certain oneparamet subgroup element associ to some algebra
gener to explain thi choic we rst select a real ag o g1 l1 g1 as follow o is the origin point o 1 0 0 g1 is the orbit of o under the onedimension
subgroup gener by p1 thu the complex line l1 is the orbit of o under the subgroup
gener by p1 q1 and the linegeodes g1 is the orbit of l1 under the subgroup gener by j thi ag is determin by singl out the gener p1 q1 j now move
17
the triangl to the canon posit where c coincid with o the side a is on g1 and
the side b lie on a geodes in g1 thi canon posit guarante that the side b
is obtain from a by mean of two commut rotat gener by j and i where
the phase rotat gener i is the uniqu gener in the ducial cartan subalgebra
commut with j as angular invari take the canon paramet c hermitian
or pure angl between complex line and c angular phase between real1d geodes
within a complex line of the two rotat whose product
ecj ec i
51
carri the side a to coincid with b thi product will be call complet rotat about
the vertex c
sinc hermitian ckd space are rankon and therefor each pair of point have a singl invari it would seem enough to consid the fs distanc a between the point c b
as the uniqu moduli of side thi is what wa done in the previou work on hermitian
trigonometri 9 10 11 13 but the formal dualiti requir prompt the consider of translat partner to both j i and sinc dualiti map j i into p1 t1 thi
suggest the use of the follow complet translat
eap1 ea t1
52
as well as the dualiti requir there are geometr reason for the use of the extra
translat ea t1 the pure translat eap1 carri the vertex c to b but thi alon
doe not carri the uniqu complex linegeodes at the vertex c determin by c a c b
to the complex linegeodes at b determin by c b c c an addit ea t1 is requir
to bring them into each other
if we now consid complet rotat at each vertex and complet translat along
each side dualiti is manifestli restor at each vertex a complet rotat is requir
to bring into coincid simultan the side seen both as complex line and as
pointgeodes side and along each side a complet translat is requir to bring into
coincid simultan both the vertic as point and the complex linegeodes
determin at each vertex by the two side
thi choic of two conmmut gener is veri natur from a quantum mechan wiewpoint and aord six vertex quantiti three hermitian or pure angl a b c

the three complet translat along the orient side of the triangl loop as a complet

to such a simpl result in the literatur
the explicit dualiti of the start equat 53 under the interchang a b c

so that the two quantiti

but more suitabl to display the trigonometr equat thi new equat is inde the
bridg between the former equat and the trigonometri of the space
the idea is to express all the gener as suitabl conjug of one pair of a translat and a phase translat gener and one pair of a rotat gener and a phase
rotat gener which we will take as primit independ gener a natur

512 and 514 call the complex hermitian point loop and the complex hermitian

sever point are worth highlight first each term in the basic ident is either

translat or rotat are exactli the triangl side angl later and angular phase
in the point loop or line loop equat the transform involv are the translat

second these equat are analogu to the one found in the real case with the

up of two commut factor the point loop equat follow from a point travel
along the triangl accord to the obviou shorthand a b c see gure 3a the line loop
equat follow from a line loop about the triangl like b a c it start in a base line
say a and success rotat by an angl c then by an angl a and nalli by an

see gure 3b the basic equat follow from the pattern a c b a c b which keep track

third the three point loop equat and the three line loop equat are mutual
dual set the singl basic equat is clearli selfdual and fourth these equat hold in

the basic equat of trigonometri for ani complex hermitian twodimension cayleykleindickson space
to obtain the trigonometr equat for the complex hermitian ckd space we start
with the basic trigonometr ident 519 for the triangl in it canon posit so

each equat in thi set either is selfdual or appear in a mutual dual pair thi
could have been expect due to the selfdual of the start equat we should
recal again that all along thi section i denot the imaginari unit of the cayleydickson

the equat of the real space s

a a a a alway appear in the equat with a minu sign as compar with
b b b b c c c c thi follow from the structur of the basic equat 61 in
which the side a and vertex a are travers or rotat backward
the set 62 is equival to two other similar set obtain by start with the basic

b a c b a c in order to present all these equat in a concis way it prove adequ

confer an uniform appear to the equat 62 in particular the angular and later

64
where i i j j k k are ani cyclic permut of 123 thi basic equat can be
veri simpli recal replac in the shorthand ikjikj each letter by the associ complet translat or rotat from now on we will adopt thi convent which make all
equat of trigonometri explicitli invari under cyclic permut of the orient
complet side xi i and angl xi i capit indic will also help in distinguish
between mutual dual pair xi xi and i i
61
the trigonometr equat in the cartan sector
each equat in 62 is complex and phase both later and angular appear through
unimodular complex factor ei ei while pure side and angl xi xi appear through
their label sine or cosin which are alway real the equat in the third line split
into an equat for the modulu and anoth for the argument thi last part is
j 2k i j 2k i
65
write the same equat for the choic of indic i j k j k i and compar we get

66
these three equat onli two of which are independ are selfdual and hold for all
the complex ckd space a consequ of these veri simpl linear relat is

67
the common valu in thi formula turn out to be a quantiti rst introduc for the

68
in a similar dual way and start also from 66 we nd anoth linear relat between

611
the invari resp are thu two kind of mix phase excess with domin
of angular resp later phase the departur from the bt notat to our
25
conform to the typograph convent upperlow case in order to stress dualiti and
to convey that each mix excess ha domin of either angular or later phase
these invari and the two phase excess which appear in the point and line
loop equat are relat by

thu there is a sector of hermitian trigonometri involv onli phase and complet

form in the twenti seven complex ckd space as no explicit label 1 2 appear
sinc the triangl invari i i are relat to the cartan subalgebra we will call these
equat the cartan sector of complex hermitian trigonometri thi cartan sector
ha no analogu in the trigonometri of real space and their equat are pure linear
wit the abelian charact of cartan subalgebra
62
the complet set of complex hermitian trigonometr equat
now by exploit the cartan relat between phase 66 and introduc explicitli
the invari it turn out possibl to simplifi the equat 62 by multipli

these equat will be refer to by a tag and are either selfdual for instanc
2ij 2ij or appear in mutual dual pair as 1i 1i equat with tag 0 allow the
introduct of the symmetr invari and and are in the cartan sector the
remain tag are intent made to match the one use in 1 the equat with tag
1 2 3 4 are in most respect the closest complex hermitian analogu to the equat
found in the real case as far as their mutual relat depend or independ etc
are concern therefor the trigonometri of real space provid a rough rst guid in
the explor of the whole forest of complex hermitian trigonometr equat
63
the complex hermitian trigonometr bestiarium
take the equat 613 as start point we now perform a fulli explicit studi of
complex hermitian trigonometri includ some comment as the scheme enjoy selfdual those equat which are not selfdual will have a dual partner obtain by
26
exchang in capit of name and indic x x i i and in ck
constant 1 2 in these case we will onli sketch the deriv of one member of the

of thi approach the label doe not chang under dualiti
these equat will hold for all twenti seven complex ckd space with arbitrari

0 or 2 0 degener complex hermitian metric some equat may collaps or
even reduc to trivial ident these case will be discuss later but for the moment
we will stay in the gener situat where 1 2 are assum to have ani valu all

each of the complex hermitian cosin theorem 1i and 1i is a complex equat by
split the hermitian cosin theorem 1i into real and imaginari part we get

symplect area and coarea
for real ck space the angular excess share three properti goe to zero with 1 it
is proport coecient 1 to triangl area and satis gaussbonnet type equat
these three properti are split in the complex case in the hermitian point loop
equat 511 and 512 the complet excess play a role partli analogu of
the real angular excess yet it may not vanish with 1 there are two differ independ
hermitian triangl quantiti which vanish with 1 one of them is the blaschketerheggen
invari thi follow directli from the equat alreadi deriv the situat for
the other vanish quantiti is not so obviou see howev the comment in the next
section dualli while the real excess is proport to the coarea vanish with 2
and satis dual gaussbonnet type equat the complet later excess appear
in 514 and may not vanish with 2 while vanish with 2
in the real case the three cosin equat 1i 1i turn into trivial ident when
1 0 2 0 in the complex hermitian case the three complex independ equat 1i 1i which are independ when 1 0 2 0 collaps when 1 0 2 0
into a singl real one in the cartan sector and as far as pure side and angl are concern becom trivial

note the factor 2 are in full agreement with the standard denit of symplect area
as the integr of the symplect form over ani surfac dress the triangl thi form is
close so by the stoke theorem the integr depend onli on the boundari
therefor all appear of or in trigonometr the equat could be rewritten
in term of trigonometr function of the symplect area s with label 21 the symplect

depend and basic equat
in the complex hermitian and hyperbol space a triangl is known to be determin
by four independ quantiti sinc we have found eight gener independ relat
between the twelv side angl and phase thi is still true in the gener ckd space
2
c s
two such relat are the hermitian phase theorem 614 the other six
1 2
happen to be exactli twice as mani independ equat as in the real case due to
their complex natur thi allow to split the depend disscus into the cartan
sector and the equat with a real analogu
the cartan sector includ six phase to which we will add symplect area and coarea
for ani valu of the label 1 2 there are four independ equat between the eight
quantiti i i s s
i i j j k k
i j k 1 2s
i j k 2 2s
648
so in ani case there are alway four independ such cartan sector quantiti gener
the triangl is almost determin by these quantiti see 640 641
in order to discuss the depend of the remain equat let us consid
g 1 c21 xi c21 xj c21 xk 2c1 xi c1 xj c1 xk c
g 1 c22 xi c22 xj c22 xk 2c2 xi c2 xj c2 xk c
31
649
the quantiti g is the determin of the gramm matrix whose element are the
hermitian product of the vector correspond to the vertic in the linear ambient
space and g it dual quantiti from 642 and 312 it follow that g vanish when
1 0 dualli the same happen for g when 2 0 further the quotient g 21
resp g 22 tend to a well dene nite limit when 1 0 resp 2 0 although
still goe to zero when 2 0 resp when 1 0 to see thi simplifi 649 by use
622 or 623 to obtain
g 21 2 s21 xi s22 xj s21 xk
g 1 22 s22 xi s21 xj s22 xk
650
thi suggest to introduc two new renorm quantiti in a way similar to 646

let us now discuss the depend issu in the gener case 1 0 2 0 where all the
equat with tag 2 3 and 4 follow from 1 exactli alik in the real case thi mean that
a triangl is complet determin by the three side a b c and or by the three angl
a b c and the proof are also a verbatim translat of the real one with a singl
hermitian caveat sometim the complex conjug of an equat 1i or 1i should be
use for instanc let us deriv the hermitian sine theorem from the dual cosin theorem
1i in the case 2 0 start from the ident s21 xi s22 xj s21 xi 1 c22 xj 2
replac one factor c2 xj by it express taken from 1j and the other c2 xj by
the complex conjug then expand
1 c21 xi c21 xj c21 xk 2c1 xi c1 xj c1 xk c
21 2 s21 xk
655
which by use 649 and 651 can be rewritten as
s21 xi s22 xj
s21 xi s22 xj s21 xk
2
656
as 2 0 the rh of 656 is well dene and is clearli symmetr in the indic ijk thi
wa also clear from 651 therefor s21 xi s22 xj s21 xk s21 xj s22 xk s21 xi
lead to the sine theorem dualli when 1 0 the sine theorem follow also from the
32
three cosin theorem 1i by follow the real pattern the dual hermitian cosin theorem
and equat with tag 3 and 4 can also be deriv
therefor in the gener 1 0 2 0 case the three complex hermitian cosin
theorem 1i seen as six idepend real equat are a set of basic equat by dualiti
the same appli to the three dual cosin theorem 1i by ad to either choic the
four independ cartan sector phase equat relat the six phase s s we get a
complet set of ten equat relat fourteen quantiti a triangl in the hermitian
space 1 0 2 0 is character by four independ quantiti for instanc either
a b c or a b c which are a dual pair thi wa alreadi known for hermitian ellipt
or hyperbol space but hold for the complet famili of complex ckd space as we
shall see in the next section anoth choic are the six phase link by the two relat

altern form of hermitian cosin equat when 1 0 or 2 0
the collaps of the hermitian cosin equat 616 to 642 when 1 0 can be
circumv by write 616 in an altern form the imaginari part can be rewritten
in term of the symplect area s by use 647 for the real part the procedur
mimick the real one 1 write all cosin of the side and of in term of vers sine
v x 1 c x
c1 xi 1 1 v1 xi
c c21 2s 1 21 v21 2s
657
and then substitut in 1i expand cancel a common factor 1 and use the ident for
the vers sine of a sum thu the pair of equat 616 can be rewritten as
1i
v1 xi v1 xj xk s1 xj s1 xk c2 xi c i 1 1 v21 2sc1 xi
c1 xi s21 2s s1 xj s1 xk c2 xi s i
658
a form meaning for ani valu of 1 even if all other label are equal to zero when
1 0 they reduc to
x2i x2j x2k 2xj xk c2 xi c i
2s xj xk c2 xi s i
659
the dual cosin equat 1i allow a similar reformul

v2 xi v2 xj xk s2 xj s2 xk c1 xi c i 1 2 v22 2sc2 xi
c2 xi s22 2s s2 xj s2 xk c1 xi s i
660
which is meaning for ani valu of 2
the quantiti can be also given in term of side and symplect area angl
and symplect coarea by express which are still meaning when 1 0 2 0

thu when 1 0 but 2 0 the six real equat 1i are independ and all the
remain equat follow from the cartan sector equat 648 and from the three
pair 1i just as everyth follow from 1i in the case 1 0 dualli mutati mutandi

we nalli discuss the situat when 1 2 0 the later and angular phase

ie in the most contract case the three equat re1i collaps to a singl equat
better written as xi xj xk 0 and likewis re1i collaps to xi xj xk 0 these
two equat are howev not independ in view of the sine theorem in thi case the

dual thi fact insinu the exist of two special nongener type of triangl for
which the appropri gener equat reduc to a known simpler form
671
complex collinear triangl
the rst special case correspond to a triangl determin by three complex collinear
vertic henc collaps from the complex2d ck hermitian space su1 2 3 u 1

depend on whether 1 0 0 0 thi space is the ellipt euclidean or hyperbol
hermitian complex line side are all dierent from zero but angl xi xj xk must be

so all hermitian trigonometr equat reduc in thi case to the trigonometri of a

by use 612 and recal 0 the auxiliar triangl angular excess i j k

for 1 1 2 1 thi is the real project space rp 2 sine of both set of phase vanish whenev the other doe see 630 thi correspond to the selfdual natur of thi

overview and conclud remark
the most direct physic applic of hermitian trigonometri is to the trigonometri
of the quantum space of state which is the ellipt member 1 0 2 0 of the
famili of complex 0 ckd hermitian space geometr phase appear directli as
trigonometr invari from thi point of view thi will be discuss in the companion
paper 20
there are also other possibl interest applic of an explicit knowledg of the
trigonometri of thi famili of space the real spacetim model with zero or constant
spacetim curvatur minkowskian and de sitter spacetim are supersed by a variabl
curvatur pseudoriemannian spacetim thi is the essenc of the einstenian interpret of gravit the possibl of a kind of riemannian quantum space of state
whose curvatur might be not constant cannot be preclud a priori a good understand of the geometri of the hermitian constant curvatur case might be help to explor
and gure out what consequ might follow from thi idea and familiar with their
trigonometri is a rst order tool in thi aim
anoth physic problem where the result we have obtain could appli lie on the
use of pseudohilbert space with an indenit hermitian scalar product guptableul
type these indenit quantum space of state are those correspond to 2 0 and
it hermitian trigonometri should provid the basic elementari relat in the geometri
of these space just as the correspond real relat are the basic spacetim relat
in the de sitter and anti de sitter spacetim
the ident of the quantum space of state as a member of thi complet ckd
famili of space make it also natur to inquir about whether or not the label 1 2
may have ani sensibl physic mean within the kinemat 2 0 interpret
of the real ck space 1 is the curvatur of spacetim and 2 1c2 is relat to the
relativist constant a natur queri is are the limit 0 1 0 and n
somehow relat to a classic limit 0 within some sensibl quantum interpret
of the complex hermitian space thi is worth explor
real hyperbol trigonometri deepli involv in manifold classic problem knot
theori etc is mere a particular case of real ck trigonometri it is not unreason
to assum that some instanc at least of the gener hermitian trigonometri may be
at least as relev in the similar complexi problem 32 the intrigu indic
for an essenti complex natur of spacetim at some deep level make also worthi the
studi of complex space in a way as explicit and visual as possibl
asid the physic interest of particular result anoth potenti in the method propos in 1 and develop in the present paper lie on the possibl of open an
39
avenu for studi the trigonometri of other symmetr homogen space most of
whose trigonometri are still unknown veri few result are known in thi area a gener
sine theorem is deriv in leuzing 33 for noncompact space and the trigonometri
of the ranktwo space su 3 and sl3 csu 3 is discuss in 34 35 heavili reli
on the use of the weyl theorem on invari theori and character of invari by
mean of trace of product of matric
the trigonometri of the rankon quaternion hyperhermitian space sp3sp1
sp2 sp2 1sp1 sp2 sp2 1sp1 sp1 1 or sp6 rso2 1
sp4 r which correspond to further cayleydickson extens with a new cd label 2 and also of the octonion type analogu of the cayley plane with anoth
cd label 3 altogeth reduc in some sens to the complex twodimension case
sinc ani triangl in these space lie on a complex chain thu in a sens the studi of
trigonometri in rank one space is essenti complet with the space of real quadrat
and complex hermitian type thi reduct is not natur howev from a pure quaternion or octonion viewpoint perhap quaternion and also the except octonion
trigonometri should be understood better in ani case thi kind of approach in a r c h
spirit ts into the vi arnold idea of mathemat triniti hope it may provid a
way to the quest 32 for the quaternion analogu of berri phase
a next natur object along thi line is the studi of trigonometri of higher rank
grassmannian either real or complex thi is still larg unknown see howev 36
should the method outlin in thi paper be abl to produc in a direct form the equat
of trigonometri for grassmannian which are also veri relev space in mani physic
aplic thi would make a further step toward a gener approach to trigonometri
of ani symmetr homogen space thi goal will requir rst to group all symmetr
homogen space into ckd famili and then to studi trigonometri for each famili work in progress on thi line 37 3 38 open the possibl of realiz all simpl
lie algebra even sln r sln c so 2n su 2n and the except one as
unitari algebra leav invari an hermitian rel to some antiinvolut form
over a tensor product of two pseudodivis algebra thi realiz should allow a
test on whether or not some extens of the idea outlin here aord the equat of
trigonometri for ani homogen space in an explicit and simpl enough way
