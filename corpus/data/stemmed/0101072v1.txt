abstract it is shown how formula of the author for gener oper transmut
can be adapt to a quantum group context
1 introduct
we want to sketch here a program and a framework along with a few idea about implement it first we indic briefli some result of koelink and rosengren 40 involv
tramsmut kernel for littl qjacobi function thi is model in part on earlier work
of koornwind 45 and other on classic fourierjacobi abel and weyl transform plu
formula in qhypergeometr function see eg 39 41 43 here transmut refer to
intertwin of oper ie qb bp and the develop give a qanalysi version
of some transform and intertwin whose classic version were embed as exampl
in a gener theori of transmut of oper by the author and collabor in
3 7 8 9 10 see also the refer in these book and paper it is clear that mani
of the formula from the extens gener theori will have a qanalysi version as in 40
and the more interest problem here would seem to be that of phrase matter entir
in the languag of quantum group and ultim connect the theori to tau function in
the spirit indic below in thi direct we sketch some of the canon develop
of the author in 7
we mention also a quantum group notion of transmut

quantum stuf f
cf 5 50 52 53 in a differ context here one ha a wonder theori develop
primarili by s majid cf 50 and refer there basic the idea here is that everi
quasitriangular hopf algebra h ha a braid group analogu h of envelop algebra type
given by the same algebra unit and counit as h but with a covariant coproduct
which is braid cocommut the procedur h h is call transmut on the
other hand ani braid hopf algebra b in the braid categori of left h modul for a
quasitriangular h give rise to an ordinari hopf algebra b h call the boson
of b the modul of b in the braid categori correspond to ordinari modul of b h
in view of some theorem in 50 about boson of the braid line uq s2 etc one
expect perhap to find relat to other form of transmuat as intertwin cf 5 for

more on thi in ani event we recal that the rmatrix arriv histor in quantum
invers scatter theori give rise to quasitriangular hopf algebra ie quantum group
and thenc to braid braid with it connect to knot etc seem to be what is
it all about in connect classic and quantum mathemat
the idea of intertwin oper play a classic import role in the theori of
group represent and in particular there are connect between intertwin oper hirota bilinear equat and tau function which have some noncommut and
quantum version see eg 27 28 34 35 36 56 57 58 59 71 75 the idea here is that
a gener tau function can be defin as a gener of all the matrix element of g g in a
given highest weight represent of a univers envelop type algebra the classic kp
and toda tau function aris when g is a kacmoodi algebra of level k 1 cf also 10
in the case of quantum group such tau function are not number valu but take their
valu in noncommut algebra of function on the quantum group g the gener tau
function also satisfi bilinear hirota type qdiffer equat aris from manipul
with intertwin oper we will not tri to deal with thi fascin topic here but
will pick it up in 5 it doe provid a sourc of natur qdiffer equat relat to
intertwin in a quantum group context there are also connect to boson idea
in a quantum mechan spirit
final we will sketch some idea about qcalculu follow wess and zumino 72 73 for
exampl there is an extens literatur on differenti calculi go back at least to manin
and woronowicz cf 38 54 74 and we do not tri to review thi here see howev 5 for
some of thi there seem to be too mani differenti calculi and the wesszumino approach
develop matter directli with the action of quantum deriv act on a quantum plane
and direct connect to the heisenberg algebra thi should set the stage for begin a
construct of quantum transmut follow the classic pattern use partial differenti equat and spectral coupl of the author further develop is plan for

let us make a few remark about discret refer to 5 6 20 22 29 32 for
some background it ha long been known that standard calculu of the continuum is not
accur or even reason at the quantum level see eg 6 20 the languag of quantum group for exampl provid natur discret some of which are discuss in
1 2 5 6 26 60 in connect with standard discret and gener noncommut and discret physic have a natur compat cf 32 it seem to me howev
that there should be a natur discret impos via the principl that time is a
secondari concept gener by the transfer of energi into inform cf 6 29 51
it also seem to be weird that time ha been so success employ as a dimens as in
minkowski space for exampl when it clearli ha no relat to dimens at all cf 6 15
and refer there for other remark on time in ani event as a function of energi we
could have t te in mani form in particular think of a clock for exampl time
should often appear most natur as a discret quantiti continu transfer of energi
into time as inform doe not seem to be exclud and may be macroscopi avail
howev we conjectur that at the quantum level the transfer must be discret then we
remark on quantum transmut

henc if one is discret some standard differenti equat involv time with grid
space x and t it appear natur to work with z1 2t 12 32 we
note that there are mani discret correspond to a given pde for exampl so there
should be a choic mechan perhap the altern is to deriv quantum pde directli
from a quantum group context for exampl which is undoubtedli the best recours thi
will be discuss later
we do not know of ani calcul in thi spirit by numer analyst but thi is not
an area of person expertis note howev that if one take 1 and then
z2 2t 12 which give a measur of the energi convers thu if some
discret process requir a certain valu of for implement then a signific for
aris which would then reveal the valu of t for exampl in 2 60 one work separ
with discret space and discret time quantiz of the schr
oding equat s lead
to quantum hopf symmetri algebra u s and u s thi involv nonstandard quantum
deform of s2r jordan or hdeform and some twist map which relat the
two pictur these algebra also come as limit object in a joint discret when
or tend to zero howev a combin qgroup pictur for joint discret is not yet
clear
exampl 11 note for q exph one ha for t ht depend on t
14
f qt f eh t f 1 ht f t t f q 2 t f e2h t f t 2t
so thi suggest a depend t f ee for a correspond standard discret
f f t f t to repres approxim a qderiv numer f qt f t
if te were to be differenti with still discret transfer of energi one could write approxim te t e to get t t ee then if t ht one would need
ht t ee which could be realiz via say e c and ct ht or t exphc actual it seem increasingli attract to simpli look at the q or h discret aris natur in a quantum mechan context with eg qderiv q f t f qtf tqtt
and q exph as the basic discret involv t q 1t exph 1t cf also

3 classic transmut
there are two classic approach to transmut of oper which should have
counterpart first cf 7 8 9 10 11 21 48 for detail hypothes and exampl
take a special situat if one ha uniqu solut to the partial differenti equat
remark on quantum transmut

pde z7 p dx qdi with x 0 f x and eg dy x 0 0 for suitabl
f then we can defin
31
bf y 0 y qbf bp f
note that the boundari condit can be gener consider to see thi set
p dx so p dx qdi 0 and x 0 p f with y x 0 0 so one can say that
0 y bp f while 0 y p dx x yx0 qdi x yx0 q0 y qbf
there should be some version of thi for quantum oper
secondli use the abov background we got a lot of mileag from explicitli construct
transmut oper via eigenfunct of p and q with a spectral pair cf 3 7 8
suppos for exampl that p and q both have the same continu spectrum with
32
q
p dx p x p qdx q
q
p
where eg z8 p 0 q
0 1 and d 0 d 0 0 again thi can be
gener let the relat spectral measur be dp and dq with fourier type recoveri

here for second order differenti oper z9 au a qu u q real aris in the
treatment of mani special function one ha gener p x ap x and dp is usual
absolut continu we note that for suitabl f g and p as in z9 one ha formal
z10 p df gdx af a qf g af ga qf g f ga a qg
so p dg aga qg in particular we have z11 p dp p now one can
defin
34
p xq
yfp dp
x y
and check that formal p dx qdi with x 0 p xfp dp f x
and y x 0 0 consequ as in 31 one can write z12 0 y bf y
q
yfp dp
we write down now a few more gener featur for complet and in order to exhibit
some group and perhap quantum group theoret content in particular one can defin a
gener translat oper tx f u x via
35
u x
fp p xp dp
so p dx u p d u with u x u x and then one set bf y y x f x
36
y x p x q
y p
p xq
ydp x y y u x

robert carrol

to see that thi is formal the same as 34 we write from 33 the relat z13 fp
p x fp p xdp dx fp dp p xp xdx which impli that
dp p xp xdx d darbouxchristoffel argument can also be use here
while z14 f x p x f p d dp f p xp dp d impli p xp dp x then 36 becom

with x 0 0 u x and 0 y y u 0 but from z15

now for the canon develop of the author in 7 we write eg ax p x in

where p x p xp x the follow transform are then relev where we write
f f xxdx over some rang and f f d over some rang
the rang may be discret or contain discret section we also note that mani measur
pair involv d are better express via distribut pair with a gener
spectral function distribut as in 7 55 note also that transmut doe not requir
that p and q have the same spectrum cf 3 7 thu we write for suitabl f f and d

cosq x and sinq x diverg for x the point x q 2n are close to the zero of cosq x

now w12 will be chang in accord with quantum group consider it is natur
to assum that x
is an element of a quantum plane and p should be a deriv in thi

is led to consid the algebra involv w13 x 1 qx more precis one look at

and in gener will be relat to rather than to cf 37 again thu one could
studi the algebra gener by x and modulo w13 w14 and an ideal gener by relat these can be found by an argument as befor cf z81 and use
thi is consist but if we tri to defin

and use w17 show that w18 so is unitari which justifi the factor
q 12 in the definit of the exist of a scale oper and the definit of

gener in the sens that a scale oper and a definit of conjug base on it can
be found for all the quantum plane defin by soq n and soq 1 n the definit of

seem to be a more natur isomorph later in the gl case the commut relat

where q q 1 now introduc the quantiti w23 k 1 q jk xj j and
then one can rewrit 441 in the form w24 i xi i xi i if i were a number one
could remov it by renorm the deriv but sinc it is an oper one can use the

thi impli that w25 i j j i note that in the one dimension exampl one
could write 1 qx q for the oper satisfi w20 and then x q 2 x with
q q 2 q in term of classic variabl one would have exp2hx which explain
the multipl natur of now one can defin w26 x i i 12 xi and di

thu the relat 441 are complet untangl by the transform w26 and the
whole ring of qdifferenti oper becom just the tensor product of ring dif fq2 1
lead to the result that dif fglq n dif f n which is the ring of classic differenti

62 qdiffer equat a number of qdiffer equat have been treat in
the context of symmetri see eg 1 2 13 26 46 47 60 and we mention a few result
note first that we are primarili concern with wave equat in term of determin
transmut oper and the wave equat ha a number of peculiar cf 26

there is still an infinit set of symmetri oper involv polynomi or arbitrari degre in t and x time power of dt and dx but a gener express seem elus thi is
in contrast to solv wave equat t2 x2 0 where there is conform invari in
t x and t x one note that t x t x t x doe not preserv the exponenti 2dimension lattic and light cone coordin seem more appropri for qdiffer wave
equat
in ani event go back to definit 51 if fn a ocnq and gn d are homogen of degre n then

thi would seem to be enough now for make calcul we will look first at possibl

now the rule 631 is appar say that when calcul the action of i on

next come question of uniqu and boundari condit of cauchi type and surprisingli littl seem to have been done in creat a gener theori of exist and uniqu for qdiffer equat or more gener creat a genuin algebra theori of
noncommut differ equat see howev 26 37 for some start and cf also
30 49 befor look at these we want to suggest anoth approach base on 61 cf
439443 and surround text work with two variabl we have relat 61
and one write from w23 the relat w63 1 1 q 2 1x1 1 x2 2 and
2 1 q 2 1x2 2 lead to w24 and w25 then one get 443 and it seem
possibl to transport result about equat in x i di to correspond result in xi i
recal dif fgln dif fq2 1 and mean isomorph recal also 440 or better
w21 to have an isomorph dif f 1 dif fq2 1 thi seem overli complic
howev and one might better go to anoth isomorph between the ring of classic
remark on quantum transmut
37
and qdifferenti oper due to zumino describ in 61 thu let xic be classic commut variabl and choos some order of the xi noncommut variabl ani
polynomi p xi is then written in order form and subsequ replac xi by xic
give give a polynomi p xic determin a symbol map w64 cxi cxci
which is a noncanon isomorph between the ring of polynomi thi provid a

now suppos one ha a solut of a classic wave equat w67 d

where 1 x y we can use here again 440 or better w21 as the definit

the construct of transmut from such cauchi problem is howev not immedi
becaus of possibl noncommut problem for exampl go back to 31 one
requir p dx qdi p dx p dx p dx qdi 0 but p q qp in
gener for a noncommut situat where eg xi xj qxj xi i j q 1 j i for i j
as in cf 69 and note that w66 doe not stipul d1 d2 d2 d1 let us think of

one can extend the reason abov to ani well pose prolem for a classic pde ie
well pose mean there exist a uniqu solut aris from the construct w65
with suitabl boundari condit perhap on vertic andor horizont line and assert

proposit 63 given a well pose classic problem for d

data and solut and a fix order of noncommut x one obtain a well pose
qdifferenti problem for d 1 0 from w65 and the isomorph
in 26 one consid wave equat w69 dt 2 d1 d2 0 where dt t1 1
tq and dx1 x1 1 tq2 correspond to the classic equat t2 41 2 0 when
t 1 qt and xi 1 q 1 xi 2 with q 1 solut to w69 in qexponenti
have the form q 2

from which one can determin symmetri oper cf 26 on the other hand for
w70 dt d1 d2 0 one ha solut eq teq x1 eq x2 with q

q 1 eq z with similar formula for eq for the helmholz equat w71 d1 d2

further that the classic correspond qy be of say ellipt symmetr type so that

and the kernel should be express in the form of a pair q

the fact that thi is true follow from 535 note that one could also develop a fourier
