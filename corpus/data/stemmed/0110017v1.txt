1 introduct
rare bmeson decay are induc by the flavorchang neutral current fcnc and they occur
onli through electroweak loop in the standard model sm thu on the one hand they provid
fertil test ground for the sm and on the other hand they offer a complementari strategi for
constrain new physic beyond the sm such as the two higg doublet model 2hdm minim
supersymmetr extens of the sm 1 ect from the experiment point of view studi rare b
meson decay can provid essenti inform about the poorli known paramet of the sm like
the element of the cabibbokobayashimaskawa ckm matrix the lepton decay constant etc
in thi work we studi the radi b decay in the gener twohigg doublet model
2hdm it is induc by the purelepton decay b and in principl the latter can be use
to determin the decay constant fb 2 as well as the fundament paramet of the sm howev
it is well known that process b are helic suppress for light lepton mode have
branch ratio of the order of 109 for and 1010 for e channel 3 although the
b channel is free from thi suppress it observ is difficult due to low effici if a
photon line is attach to ani of the charg line see fig1 the pure lepton process b
chang into the correspond radi one b so helic suppress is overcom and
larger branch ratio are expect depend on whether the photon is releas from the initi
quark or final lepton line there exist two differ type of contribut name the socal the
structur depend sd and the intern bremsstrahlung ib respect while contribut
come from the releas of the free photon from ani charg intern line will be suppress by a
2
the sd contribut is govern by the vector and axial vector form factor and
factor of m2b mw
it is free from the helic suppress therefor it could enhanc the decay rate of the radi
process b in comparison to the decay rate of the pure lepton one b as for
the ib part of the contribut it is proport to the ratio m mb and therefor it is still helic
suppress for the light charg lepton mode while it enhanc the amplitud consider for
mode inde b decay have been investig in the framework of the sm for light and
heavi lepton mode 35 as well as in the model beyond the sm 6 7 and it wa found that in the
sm brb 235 109 3 190 109 4 954 109 5 for e respect
with long distanc contribut brb 152 108 wa obtain 5 in 2hdm in
contrast to the channel with light lepton the channel b receiv addit contribut
from the neutral higg boson nhb exchang in addit to sd and ib one in 6 b
decay is investig in model i and ii type of the 2hdm includ nhb effect and shown that
these effect are sizabl when tan is larg our aim in thi work is to studi the sensit of the
1
physic measur quantiti such as branch ratio photon energi densiti forwardbackward
asymmetri of the final lepton and lepton polar asymmetri to the nhb effect as well as to

the model iii paramet like the yukawa coupl nbb
and n
the work is organ as follow in section 2 after a brief summari about the main point of the
gener 2hdm we first present the lead order lo qcd correct effect hamiltonian for the
process b s includ the nhb effect and then give the matrix element for the exclus
b decay togeth with the explicit express for the doubl differenti decay width
photon energi distribut forwardbackward asymmetri and the polar asymmetri of the final
lepton section 3 is devot to the numer analysi of the depend of these observ
on the model iii paramet and also on nhb effect final in the appendix we give the explicit
form of the oper appear in the hamiltonian and the correspond wilson coeffici
2 the b decay in the framework of the gener 2hdm
the 2hdm is the minim extens of the sm which consist of ad a second doublet to the
higg sector in thi model there are one charg higg scalar two neutral higg scalar and one
neutral higg pseudoscalar the gener yukawa lagrangian which is respons for the interact
of quark with gaug boson can be written as

for m 1 2 are the two scalar doublet qil are quark doublet ujr djr are the correspond
quark singlet ijud and ijud are the matric of the yukawa coupl the yukawa lagrangian in
eq 1 open up the possibl that there appear treelevel fcnc in the sm and in model i and
model ii type of the 2hdm such fcnc at tree level are forbidden by the gim mechan 8 and
by an ad hoc discret symmetri 9 respect howev treelevel fcnc are permit in the
gener 2hdm and thi type of 2hdm is refer to as model iii in the literatur
in thi model it is possibl to choos 1 and 2 in the follow form

there is a singular in mib 2 at the lower limit of the photon energi due to the soft photon
emiss from charg lepton line while msd 2 and remsd mib term are free from thi singular it ha been shown that when process b and b are consid togeth
the singular term in mib 2 exactli cancel the o virtual correct in b amplitud
but instead of thi approach we prefer the one use in ref5 which amount to impos a cut on the
photon energi ie we requir e 50 mev thi restrict mean that we onli consid the hard

in thi section we first studi the dimensionless photon energi depend of the differenti

there is a singl curv sinc the contribut for both c7ef f 0 and c7ef f 0 fit onto each other we

see that br is quit sensit to the paramet nbb

of d mb while for rtb 1 it is increas further br is 23 order larger compar to the sm
nbb
result for rtb 1 case for rtb 1 the enhanc with respect to the sm predict is rel

lie in the region bound by solid line for c7ef f 0 and it is sensit to the nhb effect while for
c7ef f 0 it is almost the same as the sm result dash straight line note that the sm predict
for the br is 789 109 and in model iii without nhb effect when rtb 1 it is in between
783 797 109 for c7ef f 0 and 873 850 109 for c7ef f 0 when rtb 1 upper

in fig 8 the differenti af b x is shown for nbb

that the valu of af b x stand less than the sm one the dash curv repres c7ef f 0 case

in fig 10 we plot the af b as a function of the yukawa coupl n

from fig 10 that af b vanish for the larg valu of d for c7ef f 0 while c7ef f 0 it doe

the 2hdm contribut chang pl significantli compar to the sm case for c7ef f 0 especi
for the small valu of x fig 13 is the same as fig 12 but rtb 1 with d 01 mb in thi
nbb

figur two solid curv restrict the possibl valu of pl for both c7ef f 0 and c7ef f 0 and it is
seen that both the magnitud and the sign of pl are chang for rtb 1
d
the depend of pl on the nhb paramet n
is present in fig 14 15 for

nbb
the region bound by dash line solid curv for c7ef f 0 c7ef f 0 fig 14 while in case
of rtb 1 the contribut for both c7ef f 0 and c7ef f 0 coincid and they are repres by the
singl solid curv in fig15 it is obviou that pl is veri much sensit to the nhb effect for
both rtb 1 and rtb 1 case we note that sm predict for pl is 036 and in model iii
without nhb effect when rtb 1 it is about 031 for c7ef f 0 and 036 for c7ef f 0 when
rtb 1 the valu of pl without nhb effect is about 036 for both c7ef f 0 and c7ef f 0
thu the valu of pl without nhb effect reach at most the sm predict but nhb effect
enhanc it between 5 100 even for small valu of d we would like to summar our

tabl 1 the valu of the input paramet use in the numer calcul
result
we observ an enhanc in the differenti branch ratio and branch ratio for the exclus process b in the gener 2hdm compar to the sm predict for rtb 1
case thi enhanc is much more detect for c7ef f 0 case compar to the c7ef f 0
one for rtb 1 we see that contribut for c7ef f 0 and c7ef f 0 almost coincid with
each other and the enhanc with respect to the sm is much more sizabl
11
br for b decay is at the order of magnitud 109 107 in the sm and in model iii
without nhb effect for rtb 1 rtb 1 howev includ nhb exchang may enhanc
it almost two order of magnitud compar to the sm predict even for the smaller valu
of d
n
af b is at the order of magnitud 101 102 for rtb 1 rtb 1 case and smaller compar
to the sm result which is 0181
the 2hdm contribut chang pl and pl greatli compar to the sm case and these
quantiti are veri sensit to the nhb effect
in conclus we can say that experiment investig of br af b and pl may provid an essenti
test for the effect of nhb exchang and new physic beyond the sm
