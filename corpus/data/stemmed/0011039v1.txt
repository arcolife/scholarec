in fact the condit that a is posit definit can be remov by
use anoth formul of the function jm see 13 45 theorem
11 is sharp in the sens that if there is a subset j i with j m 0
then inf uh 1 n jm u when n 1 the condit 14 is
equival to a11 m1 8 therefor it is natur to conjectur 45
that theorem 11 hold if and onli if
j m 0 for ani j i
16
in 45 a proof of thi conjectur wa sketch for a special but interest case
theorem 12 let a be a symmetr posit definit row stochast
matrix ie
n
aij 1 for ani i i
aij 0 and
17
j1
then there is a constant c 0 such that
jm u c
for ani u h 1 n
if and onli if 16 hold
the onli if part wa first prove in 13 in a more gener case it is
clear that in gener such an inequ cannot be true if the coeffici
matrix a admit some neg entri howev in mani interest
system aris in physic and differenti geometri there are neg
coeffici for instanc in the toda system and the relativist and
nonrelativist nonabelian chernsimon model 32 20 24 26
in thi paper we want to gener theorem 12 to the toda system

the open sun 1 toda system or 2dimension toda lattic is
n
aij euj for i 1 2 n
ui
18
j1
the popular interpret of the onedimension toda lattic is a
hamiltonian system which describ the motion of n particl move
in a straight line with exponenti interact the twodimension
toda system ha a much closer relationship with differenti geometri
it can be seen as the frenet frame of holomorph curv into cpn
for the toda system and it geometr interpret see eg26 and
refer therein see also 20
in thi paper we establish the follow mosertruding type inequ for 18
theorem 13 let be a close surfac with area 1 and a k
defin a function n h 1 n r by
m u

then the function ha a lower bound if and onli if
mj 4
for j 1 2 n
19
we remark that the condit 19 is equival to 16 in thi
case sinc the coeffici matrix k admit neg entri we might
encount the problem that the maximum principl fail thi is the
reason whi we cannot classifi all entir solut of 18 with finit
energi yet see section 2 and 7 fortun when prove theorem
13 we can avoid thi problem
we outlin our main idea of the proof of theorem 13 for n 2 we
first show that m ha a lower bound if mj 4 for j 1 2 theorem
41 the idea is as follow let us defin
m m1 m2 r r inf m
from the ordinari mosertruding inequ 11 we know
theorem 41 now is equival to 0 4 0 4 if it were fals
then there exist m 0 m10 m20 such that m m10 m20
we are abl to classifi all such solut now
analyt aspect of the toda system i
5
but m10 m20 for ani small 0 it is easi to show
that m admit a minim u u1 u2 which satisfi 13 for
m m10 m20 if u blow up there are three case see
section 4 below for each case after rescal we obtain a bubbl
which is an entir solut of the liouvil equat 36 or the toda
system 18 with finit energi a classif result of 12 for the
liouvil equat and corollari 26 below impli that in ani case one
of m10 and m20 is larger than or equal to 4 a contradict howev
u may not blow up ding 14 introduc a trick to deal with such
a problem in hi studi of the ordinari mosertruding inequ
follow hi trick we perturb the function m a littl bit such that
the result function fm also admit a minim u which doe
blow up as 0 u satisfi a similar system as 13 and ha the
same bubbl then we are abl to use the argument abov to get a
contradict
to prove theorem 13 we consid the sequenc of minim u
u1 u2 of m with m m 0 4 4 for small
0 the exist of the u follow from theorem 41 u satisfi
a toda type system if u converg u0 in h2 h 1 h 1 then
it is clear that inf uh2 m 0 u m 0 u0 henc we may
assum u doe not converg in h2 use the analysi develop in
section 2 and 3 we know there are three possibl a s1 1 and
s2 b s1 s2 1 and s1 s2 and c s1 s2 1
and s1 s2 here sj j 1 2 is the blowup set defin in
section 5 below and s is the number of point of the finit set s
we use a local pohozaev ident to exclud case b thi is the
crucial point to avoid the aforement problem that the maximum
principl fail sinc the remain case are essenti scalar problem
in fact we can reduc case a directli to the correspond problem
of one functionth ordinari mosertruding inequ for case b
we can appli the method develop in 15 38 to give a lower bound
of m 0
we shall appli theorem 13 in a forthcom paper 30 to studi the
relativist sun 1 nonabelian chernsimon model 32 34 35

20 which can be seen as a nonintegr perturb of the integr toda system 18 for mathemat aspect of the relativist
nonabelian chernsimon model see 49 47 we hope theorem 13
will becom a power tool for studi problem aris from higher
rank model as the ordinari mosertruding inequ ha becom
in the abelian case
for simplic we onli give detail proof for the case n 2 the
proof in case n 2 are complet analog and just requir a more
complic notat in section 2 we analyz the solut of 18
in r2 and obtain a relat between r2 eu1 and r2 eu2 for ani entir
solut of 18 in section 3 we analyz the converg of solut
as in 3 in section 4 we first show m ha a lower bound if mj 4
for all j then we show that if m ha a lower bound mj 4 for all
j we prove theorem 13 in section 5

in thi section we consid the analysi of solut of the follow
system

which is equival to 211 thi prove the lemma
similar result for system with nonneg entri were obtain
in 10 and 13 we conjectur that 1 2 8 it is also veri
interest to classifi all solut of 21 with finit energi r2 euj
for j 1 2 when solut have suitabl decay near infin such
that they can be seen as function on s2 the classif wa obtain
by differenti geomet and physicist see 23 20 in fact in thi
case all solut can been seen as minim immers from s2 to cp2
which are deform of the verones immers by the action of the
group p gl3 c see 23 2 48
3 converg of solut
in thi section we consid the converg of solut of the toda
system we follow the method develop in 3 but we need to be
care with the use of the maximum principl sinc the coeffici
matrix ha some neg entri
for simplic we onli consid the system on the bound domain
we have

case uki on ani compact subset of si and either ukj is

bound in l

ani compact subset of s1 2 for j 1 2
proof here for simplic we onli give a proof of the theorem when

in view of 32 we may assum that there exist two nonneg
bound measur 1 and 2 such that
k

for everi smooth function with support in and j 1 2 a point
x is call a regular point with respect to j if there is a function
cc 0 1 with 1 in a neighborhood of x such that
dj
we defin
j x x is not a regular point with respect to j
by definit and 32 it is clear that 1 and 2 are finit and
j is independ of for small 0 see below we divid the
proof into 3 step
step 1 for j 1 2 sj j provid

first from lemma 22 we know that for ani point x 1

ukj is bound in l br0 x for j 1 2

we now continu to prove theorem 41 by consid the sequenc

we claim that u blow up ie

otherwis we can show that u converg to some u0 in h2 that is a

proof theorem 41 impli that m not onli ha a lower bound but
also satisfi the coerciv condit sinc m is weakli lower semicontinu there is a minim that satisfi 46 which is the eulerlagrang equat of m
to end thi section we observ that 4 is the best constant

then we will show that

lemma 52 s1 1 and s2 1
proof by 57 we have s1 1 let y s1 and choos 0 so small

which impli that s1 y by 58 becaus of 54
assum by contradict that s2 2 then there exist z s2

it follow togeth with 55 that

by 58 we have s2 z a contradict

we discuss the sequenc u case by case we shall show that case

inequ case a is easi to handl while case c is more delic
case a reduct to the ordinari mosertruding inequ
let s1 p in thi case by theorem 31 and similar argument
given in the proof of lemma 56 in case c below we can show that

furthermor we have the follow lemma

of p we also have either
i u2 as 0 on ani compact subset of p or
ii u2 is uniformli bound on ani compact subset of p
we first consid case i in thi case the same argument given in

then we appli 513 again to get a contradict in fact we can
show that in thi case it left hand tend to 241 2 while it right

impli that case ii henc case b doe not happen either
such an argument use aloc pohozaev ident wa use in 46

case c thi case is more delic
set s1 p1 and s2 p2 note that p1 p2 in view of theorem
31 and the blowup argument given abov uj j 1 2 tend to
