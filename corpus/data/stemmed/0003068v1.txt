melt peak of the heat capac and is accompani by a peak in the deriv of the heat capac with temperatur parallel temper is shown to

becaus the properti of molecular aggreg impact divers area rang from nucleat and condensation1 to heterogen catalysi the studi of cluster ha continu
to be an import part of modern condens matter scienc cluster can be view as
an intermedi phase of matter and cluster can provid inform about the transform from finit to bulk behavior furthermor the potenti surfac of cluster can be
complex and mani cluster are use prototyp for studi other system have complex
phenomenolog
the properti of small cluster can be unusu owe to the domin of surfac rather
than bulk atom a particularli import and well studi exampl of a properti that
owe it behavior to the presenc of larg number of surfac atom is cluster structure24
the structur of cluster can differ significantli from the structur of the correspond
bulk materi and these differ in structur have implic about the properti of
the cluster for exampl most small lennardjon lj cluster have global potenti
surfac minima that are base on icosahedr growth pattern the fivefold symmetri
of these cluster differ substanti from the closestpack arrang observ in bulk
materi
while most small lennardjon cluster have geometri base on icosahedr core
structur there can be exceptions257 a notabl exampl is the 38atom lennardjon
cluster lj38 thi cluster is particularli interest owe to it complex potenti surfac
and associ phenomenolog the potenti surfac for lj38 ha been describ in detail
by doy miller and wales5 who have care construct the disconnect graph89 for
the system use inform garner from basin hop and eigenvector follow studi
of the low energi potenti minima along with examin of the transit state barrier
the gener structur of thi potenti surfac can be imagin to be two basin of similar
energi separ by a larg energi barrier with the lowest energi basin be significantli
narrow than the second basin strike is the global minimum energi structur for lj38
which unlik the case for most small lennardjon cluster is not base on an icosahedr
core but rather is a symmetr truncat octahedron the vertic defin by the surfac
atom of lj38 have a morpholog ident to the first brillouin zone of a face center
cubic lattice10 and the high symmetri of the cluster may account for it stabil it is
interest to note that recent experiment studies11 of nickel cluster use nitrogen uptak
measur have found the global minimum of ni38 to be a truncat octahedron as well
the basin of energi minima about the global minimum of lj38 is narrow compar to
the basin about the next highest energi isom which doe have an icosahedr core the
differ in energi between the global minimum and the lowest minimum in the icosahedr
basin is onli 038 of the energi of the global minimum5
characterist of some thermodynam properti of small cluster are rang of temperatur over which these properti chang rapidli in a fashion reminisc of the diverg
behavior known to occur in bulk phase transit at a singl temperatur the rapid
chang in such thermodynam properti for cluster are not diverg and occur over a
rang of temperatur owe to the finit size of the system in accord with the usag
introduc by berri beck davi and jellinek12 we refer to the temperatur rang where
rapid chang occur as phase chang region rather than use the term phase transit that is reserv for system at the thermodynam limit as an exampl lj55 display
a heat capac anomali over a rang in temperatur often associ with what ha been
term cluster melting13 molecular dynam and microcanon simul perform
at kinet temperatur in the melt region of lj55 exhibit van der waal type loop in
the calor curv and coexist between solidlik and liquidlik form
in recent studi doy wale and miller14 and miller doy and wales15 have examin
the phase chang behavior of lj38 these author have calcul the heat capac and
isom distribut as a function of temperatur use the superposit method1617 in the
superposit method the microcanon densiti of state is calcul for each potenti
minimum and the total densiti of state is then construct by summat with respect
to each local densiti of state becaus it is not possibl to find all potenti minima for
a system as complex as lj38 the summat is augment with factor that repres the
effect weight of the potenti minima that are includ in the sum the superposit
method ha also been improv to account for anharmon and stationari points17 for
lj38 doy et al14 have identifi two phase chang region the first accompani by a heat
capac maximum is associ with a solidtosolid phase chang between the truncat
octahedr basin and the icosahedr basin a higher temperatur heat capac anomali
repres the solidliquid coexist region similar to that found in other cluster system
the heat capac anomali associ with the melt transit in lj38 is steeper and more
pronounc than the heat capac peak that doy et al14 have associ with the solidsolid transit becaus the weight that enter in the sum to construct the microcanon
densiti of state are estim it is import to confirm the find of doy et al14 by
detail numer simul such simul are a goal of the current work and it
companion paper as is found in section iii the simul provid a heat capac curv
for lj38 that ha some qualit differ with the curv report by doy et al14
owe to the complex structur of the potenti surfac of lj38 the system repres
a particularli challeng case for simul it is well known that simul of system
have more than one import region of space separ by signific energi barrier can
be difficult the difficulti are particularli sever if ani of the region are either narrow
or reachabl onli via narrow channel the narrow basin about the global minimum make
simul of lj38 especi difficult there are sever method that have been develop
that can prove to be use in overcom such ergod difficulti in simul mani of
these method use inform about the underli potenti surfac gener from simul on the system use paramet where the variou region of configur space are
wellconnect one of the earliest of these method is jwalking18 where inform about
the potenti surfac is obtain from simul at high temperatur and the inform
is pass to low temperatur walk by jump period to the high temperatur walk
close alli with jwalk is the parallel temper method1923 where configur are
exchang between walker run at two differ temperatur a relat approach24
similar in spirit to jwalk use tsalli distribut that are suffici broad to cover
much of configur space anoth recent addition25 to these method is the use of multicanon distributions26 in the jump process multicanon walk are perform use
the entropi of the system and multicanon distribut are nearli independ of the
energi therebi allow easi transit between energi basin as we discuss in the current work we have found the parallel temper method to be most use in the context
of simul of lj38 a compar discuss of some of the method outlin abov is
given later in thi paper
in the current work we appli parallel temper to the calcul of the thermodynam
properti of lj38 in the canon ensembl in the paper that follows27 we again use parallel
temper to studi lj38 but use molecular dynam method along with microcanon
mont carlo simul our goal are to understand better thi complex system and to
determin the best simul method for system of compar complex the content
of the remaind of thi first paper are as follow in section ii we discuss the method
use with particular emphasi on the parallel temper approach and it relat to the
jwalk method in section iii we present the result includ the heat capac as a
function of temperatur and identifi the phase chang behavior of lj38 in section iv we
present our conclus and describ our experi with altern to parallel temper

metropoli method rigor guarante a random walk visit configur space proport to a given densiti function asymptot in the limit of an infinit number of step
in practic when configur space is divid into import region separ by signific energi barrier a low temperatur finit metropoli walk can have prohibit long
equilibr time
such problem in attain ergod in the walk do not occur at temperatur suffici high that the system ha signific probabl of find itself in the barrier region
in both the jwalk and parallel temper method inform obtain from an ergod
metropoli walk at high temperatur is pass to a low temperatur walker period to

in practic at invers temperatur the trial move are taken from the metropoli distribut about 90 of the time with jump attempt use eq9 about 10 of the time
the jump configur are gener with a metropoli walk at invers temperatur
j and jump attempt are accept use eq10 the accept express eq10
is correct provid the configur chosen for jump are a random represent of
the distribut ej u r the metropoli walk that is use to gener the configur
at invers temperatur j is correlated28 and eq10 is inappropri unless jump are
attempt suffici infrequ to break the correl in practic metropoli walk
are still correl after 10 step and it is not possibl to use eq10 correctli if jump
are attempt 10 of the time in jwalk the difficulti with correl is overcom in
two way in the first method often call serial jwalking18 a larg set of configur is
store to an extern distribut with the configur gener with a metropoli walk
at invers temperatur j and configur store onli after suffici step to break the
correl in the metropoli walk addit the configur are chosen from the
extern distribut at random thi extern distribut is made suffici larg that
the probabl of ever choos the same configur more than onc is small in thi
method detail balanc is strictli satisfi onli in the limit that the extern distribut
is of infinit size in the second method often call parallel jwalking3132 the walk at
each temperatur are made in tandem on a parallel machin mani processor randomli
initi are assign to the jump temperatur and each processor at the jump
temperatur is use to donat a high temperatur configur to the low temperatur
walk suffici infrequ that the correl in the metropoli walk at invers temperatur j are broken in thi parallel method configur are never reus but the
accept criterion eq10 is strictli valid onli in the limit of an infinit set of processor
at invers temperatur j in practic both serial and parallel jwalk work well for mani
applic with finit extern distribut or with a finit set of processors183138
in parallel tempering1923 configur from a high temperatur walk are also use
to make a low temperatur walk ergod in contrast to jwalk rather than the high
temperatur walk feed configur to the low temperatur walk the high and low
temperatur walker exchang configur by exchang configur detail balanc
is satisfi onc the metropoli walk at the two temperatur are suffici long to be
in the asymptot region to verifi detail balanc is satisfi by the parallel temper
procedur we let
2 r r z 1 eu r ej u r

be the joint densiti that the low temperatur walker is at configur r and the high
temperatur walker is at configur r when configur between the two walker are
exchang the detail balanc condit is

13
it is evid that if exchang are accept with the same probabl as the accept
criterion use in jwalk see eq10 detail balanc is satisfi
although the basic notion use by both jwalk and parallel temper are similar
the organ of a parallel temper calcul can be significantli simpler than the
organ of a jwalk calcul in parallel temper no extern distribut are
requir nor are multipl processor requir at ani temperatur parallel temper can
be organ in the same simpl way that serial tandem jwalk is organ as discuss
in the origin jwalk reference18 unlik serial tandem jwalk where detail balanc
can be attain onli asymptot parallel temper satisfi detail balanc directli
for a problem as difficult as lj38 where veri long simul are requir the huge extern distribut need in serial jwalk or the larg set of jump processor need
in parallel jwalk make the method prohibit as discuss in section iii parallel
temper can be execut for arbitrarili long simul make the method suitabl at
least for lj38
in the current calcul parallel temper is use not just to simul the system at
some low temperatur use high temperatur inform but simul are perform
for a seri of temperatur as is the case for jwalking18 and as discuss elsewher for
parallel tempering22 the gap between adjac temperatur cannot be chosen arbitrarili
temperatur gap must be chosen so that exchang are accept with suffici frequenc
if the temperatur gap is too larg the configur import at the two exchang
temperatur can be suffici dissimilar that no exchang are ever accept preliminari
calcul must be perform to explor the temperatur differ need for accept
exchang probabl in practic we have found at least 10 of attempt exchang need
to be accept for the parallel temper procedur to be use in gener the temperatur
gap must be decreas near phase chang region or when the temperatur becom low
by exchang configur between temperatur correl are introduc at differ temperatur point for exampl the averag heat capac at two temperatur
may rise or fall togeth as each valu fluctuat statist in some case the valu of
the heat capac or other properti at two temperatur can be anticorrel the
magnitud of these correl between temperatur are measur and discuss in section iii as discuss in section iii the correl between differ temperatur impli
that the statist fluctuat must be suffici low to ensur ani featur observ in
a calcul as a function of temperatur are meaning
iii result
forti distinct temperatur have been use in the parallel temper simul of lj38
rang from t 00143kb to t 0337kb the simul have been initi
from random configur of the 38 atom within a constrain sphere of radiu 225
we have chosen rc 225 becaus we have had difficulti attain ergod with
larger constrain radii with larg constrain radii the system ha a signific boil region at temperatur not far from the melt region and it is difficult to execut
an ergod walk with ani method when there is coexist between liquidlik and vapor
region constrain radii smaller than 225 can induc signific chang in thermodynam properti below the temperatur of the melt peak use the randomli initi
configur the initi time to reach the asymptot region in the mont carlo walk
ha been found to be long with about 95 million metropoli mont carlo point follow
by 190 million parallel temper mont carlo point includ in the walk prior to data
accumul thi long initi period can be made significantli shorter by initi
each temperatur with the structur of the global minimum we have chosen to initi
the system with random configur to verifi the parallel temper method is abl to
equilibr thi system with no prior knowledg about the structur of the potenti surfac
follow thi initi period 13 1010 point have been includ with data accumul parallel temper exchang have been attempt everi 10 mont carlo pass over
the 38 atom in the cluster
in an attempt to minim the correl in the data at differ temperatur an
exchang strategi ha been use that includ exchang between sever temperatur to
understand thi strategi we let the set of temperatur be put into an array onehalf of
the exchang have been attempt between adjac temperatur in the array onefourth
have been attempt between next near neighbor temperatur oneeighth between everi
third temperatur onesixteenth between everi fourth temperatur and onethirti second
between everi fifth temperatur in the array we have truncat thi procedur at fifth near
neighbor temperatur becaus exchang between temperatur differ by more than
fifth neighbor are accept with frequenc of less than ten per cent the data present
in thi work have been gener use the procedur outlin abov in retrospect we have
found exchang are onli requir between adjac temperatur we have also perform
the calcul where exchang are includ onli between adjac temperatur and
we have seen no signific differ either in the final result or in the correl
between differ temperatur use the random initi of the cluster after the
initi period the lowest temperatur walk are domin by configur well
repres by small amplitud oscil about the global minimum structur
for all data display in thi work the error bar repres two standard deviat of
the mean the heat capac calcul from the standard fluctuat express of the

is display in the upper panel of fig 1 in agreement with the heat capac for lj38
report by doy et al14 the heat capac display in fig 1 ha a melt maximum
center at about t 0166kb in contrast to the result of doy et al14 we find no
maximum associ with the solidsolid transit between the two basin in the potenti
surfac rather we see a small chang in slope at about t 01kb to character
thi region have a chang in slope in the lower panel of fig 1 we present a graph of

the small low temperatur maximum in cv t v occur within the slope chang region
to interpret the configur associ with the variou region of the heat capac we
use an order paramet nearli ident to the order paramet introduc by steinhardt
nelson and ronchetti39 to distinguish face center cubic from icosahedr structur in
liquid and glass the order paramet ha been use by doy et al5 to monitor phase
chang in lj38 the order paramet q4 is defin by the equat

to understand the paramet use in eq17 it is help to explain how q4m is evalu
the center of mass of the full 38 atom cluster is locat and the atom closest to the center of
mass is then identifi the atom closest to the center of mass plu the 12 nearest neighbor
of that atom defin a core cluster of the 38 atom cluster the center of mass of the core
cluster is then calcul the summat in eq17 is perform over all vector that point
from the center of mass of the core cluster to all nb bond form from the 13 atom of
the core cluster a bond is assum to be form between two atom of the core cluster if
their internuclear separ rij is less than a cutoff paramet rb taken to be rb 139
in thi work in eq17 ij and ij are respect the polar and azimuth angl of the
vector that point from the center of mass of the core cluster to the center of each bond
and y4m is a spheric harmon to verifi that the optim valu of q4 is obtain
the procedur is repeat by choos the second closest atom to the center of mass of the
whole cluster to defin the core cluster the valu of q4 obtain from thi second core
cluster is compar with that obtain from the first core cluster and the smallest result
valu of q4 is taken to be the valu of q4 for the entir cluster
in the work of steinhardt et al39 fewer bond are includ in the summat appear
in eq17 than in the current work in the definit use by steinhardt et al39 the onli
bond that contribut to the sum in eq17 are those involv the central atom of the
core cluster in the definit use in thi work at low temperatur the sum includ all
the bond includ by steinhardt et al39 in addit to vector that connect the center
of mass of the core cluster with the center of bond that connect atom at the surfac
of the core cluster with each other for a perfect and undistort icosahedr or truncat
octahedr cluster the current definit and the definit of steinhardt et al39 are ident
numer owe to the rotat symmetri of the spheric harmon howev for
distort cluster the two definit differ numer for perfect undistort icosahedr
cluster q4 0 wherea for perfect undistort truncat octahedr cluster q4
019
and both definit of the order paramet are abl to distinguish configur from the
truncat octahedr basin and other basin at finit temperatur howev we have found
the definit introduc by steinhardt et al39 is unabl to distinguish structur in the
icosahedr basin from liquidlik structur thi same issu ha been discuss previous
by lyndenbel and wales40 in contrast we have found that liquidlik structur have
larger valu of q4 than icosahedr structur when the present definit of q4 ie the
definit that includ addit bond in eq17 is use consequ as discuss
shortli the current definit of q4 enabl an associ of each configur with either
the icosahedr basin the truncat octahedr basin or structur that can be identifi
as liquidlik
the averag of q4 as a function of temperatur is plot in the upper panel of fig 2
again the error bar repres two standard deviat of the mean at the lowest calcul
temperatur q4 is characterist of the global truncat octahedr minimum as the
temperatur is rais to the point where the slope chang begin in the heat capac q4
begin to drop rapidli signifi the onset of transit between the structur associ
with the global minimum and icosahedr structur we then have the first hint that the
slope chang in cv is associ with a analogu of a solidsolid transit from the truncat
octahedron to icosahedr structur
to clarifi the transit further the data plot in the lower panel of fig 2 repres
the probabl of observ particular valu of q4 as a function of temperatur the
probabl have been calcul by tabul the frequenc of observ particular valu
of q4 for each configur gener in the simul differ valu of q4 are then
assign to either icosahedr structur label ic in the graph truncat octahedr
structur label fcc or liquidlik structur label liq below by compar the
lower panel of fig 2 with the deriv of the heat capac plot in the lower panel of
fig 1 it is evid that icosahedr structur begin to be occupi and the probabl
of find truncat octahedr structur begin to fall when the deriv in the heat
capac begin to rise equilibrium between the truncat octahedr structur and the
icosahedr structur continu into the melt region and truncat octahedr structur
onli disappear on the high temperatur side of the melt peak of the heat capac doy
et al14 and miller et al15 have gener data analog to that depict in the lower
panel of fig 2 use the superposit method and the data of miller et al15 are in
qualit agreement with the present data a more direct comparison with the data of
these author can be made by perform period quench along the parallel temper
trajectori we then use an energi criterion similar to that of doy et al14 to distinguish
the three categori of geometri and to gener the respect probabl p for a
given total cluster energi e a truncat octahedron is associ with e 17326
icosahedralbas structur with 17326 e 1716 and liquidlik structur with
e 1716 the quench have been perform everi 104 mc step for each temperatur
and the result of these quench are plot in fig 3 use the energi criterion the
behavior we observ is qualit similar to the data of doy et al14 howev the largest
probabl of observ icosahedr structur is found here to be substanti lower than
doy et al14 the data accumul more recent by miller et al15 use the superposit
method includ contribut from more stationari point than in the previou work of doy
et al14 but no reweight ha been perform as a result the distribut of isom
look quit differ especi at high temperatures14
the assign of a particular valu of q4 to a structur as display in fig 2 is made
by an analysi of the probabl distribut pq t q4 of the order paramet display in
fig 4 and 5 figur 4 is a represent of the threedimension surfac of pq t q4
as a function of temperatur and order paramet a project of thi surfac onto two
dimens is given in fig 5 the probabl densiti in fig 5 is repres by the shade
so that the brighter the area the greater the probabl the horizont white line in fig
5 defin the region of the heat capac curv the lowest temperatur horizont line
repres the temperatur at which the slope of the heat capac first chang rapidli the
middl temperatur horizont line repres the lowest temperatur of the melt peak
and the highest temperatur horizont line repres the end of the melt region an
addit represent of the data is given in fig 6 where the probabl of observ
particular valu of q4 is given as a function of q4 at a fix temperatur of 014kb in
fig 6 three region are evid for pq t 014kb q4 with q4 rang from 013 to
019 although the presenc of three region seem to indic three distinct structur all
three region correspond to the truncat octahedr global minimum we have verifi thi
assign by quench the structur with q4 rang from 013 to 019 to their nearest
local minima and we have found all such structur quench to the truncat octahedron
to explain the three region we have found that there are small distort of lj38 about
the truncat octahedr structur where both the energi and q4 increas togeth these
region where both the energi and q4 increas abov q4
013 have low probabl and
account for the oscil observ in fig 46 in the lower panel of fig 2 all structur
have q4 013 have been identifi as truncat octahedra quench studi of the broad
region visibl in fig 5 at the lowest valu of q4 or equival in the first low q4 peak in
fig 6 find all examin structur to belong to the icosahedr basin to determin if a given
configur is associ with the icosahedr basin onedimension cross section plot
are made from fig 4 at each temperatur use in the calcul figur 6 is a particular
exampl of such a cross section plot the maximum present at low q4 repres the
center for structur in the icosahedr basin the next two maxima at higher q4 repres
the midpoint of the liquid region consequ in gener the lower panel of fig 2 all
configur with q4 between q4 0 and the first minimum in fig 6 have been identifi
as icosahedr structur all other valu of q4 repres by the broad intermedi
band in fig 5 or the region about the second two maxima in fig 6 have been identifi
as liquidlik structur to make these identif separ cross section of fig 4 must
be made at each temperatur of cours it is imposs to verifi that the identif of
all valu of q4 with a particular structur as discuss abov would agre with the result of
quench the structur to it nearest potenti minimum the differ found by defin
icosahedr truncat octahedr or liquidlik structur use either an energi criterion
or q4 is clarifi by compar fig 3 and the lower panel of fig 2 both definit are
arbitrari and the inform carri by the two classif method complement each
other
figur 5 also provid addit evid that the peak in cv t v is associ with
the equilibrium between the truncat octahedr structur and the icosahedr structur
there is signific densiti for both kind of structur in the region between the lowest two
parallel line that defin the region with the slope chang addit both icosahedr
structur and truncat octahedr structur begin to be in equilibrium with each other at
the begin of the slope chang region thi equilibrium continu to temperatur abov
the melt region
anoth identif of the slope chang region with a transit between truncat
octahedr and icosahedr form can be made by defin pr t rdr to be the probabl
that an atom in the cluster is found at locat r to r dr from the center of mass of the
cluster at temperatur t a project of pr t r onto the r and t plane is depict in
fig 7 the solid vertic line repres the locat of atom from the center of mass of
the truncat octahedr structur the lower set of vertic line and the lowest energi
icosahedr structur the upper set of vertic line as in fig 5 increas probabl
is repres by the lighter shade at the lowest temperatur pr t r is domin
by contribut from the truncat octahedron as is evid by compar the shade
region with the lowest set of vertic line as the temperatur is increas contribut
to pr t r begin to appear from the icosahedr structur the shade region at r 045
doe not match ani of the vertic line shown but correspond to atom in the third lowest
energi isom which like the second lowest energi isom come from the icosahedr basin
the equilibrium between the icosahedr and truncat octahedr structur observ in
fig 7 match the region of temperatur observ in fig 5
we have mention previous that parallel temper introduc correl in the data
accumul at differ temperatur and it is import to ensur the statist error
are suffici small that observ featur are real and not artifact of the correl
to measur these correl we defin a cross temperatur correl function for some

a project of t1 t2 when g cv is given in fig 8 in fig 8 white repres

these two extrem the white diagon line from the lower left hand corner to the upper
right hand corner repres the case that t1 t2 so that 1 the light shade area
near thi diagon repres case where t1 and t2 are adjac temperatur in the parallel
temper simul and we find to be onli slightli less than uniti more strike are
the black region off the diagon where is nearli 1 these black region correspond to
anticorrel between result at temperatur near the heat capac maximum in the
melt peak and temperatur near the center of the slope chang region associ with
the transit between icosahedr and truncat octahedr structur these correl
impli the import of perform suffici long simul to ensur that statist
fluctuat of the data are small compar to import featur in the data as a function
of temperatur
iv conclus
use parallel temper method we have success perform ergod simul of
the equilibrium thermodynam properti of lj38 in the canon ensembl as discuss
by doy et al5 the potenti surfac of thi system is complex with two signific basin a
narrow basin about the global minimum truncat octahedr structur and a wide icosahedr basin these two basin are separ both by structur and a larg energi barrier
make simul difficult in agreement with the result of doy et al14 we find clear
evid of equilibria between structur at the basin of the global minimum and the icosahedr basin at temperatur below the melt region unlik previou work we find no
heat capac maximum associ with thi transit but rather a region with a chang
in the slope of the heat capac as a function of temperatur
we have found parallel temper to be success with thi system and have note
correl in our data at differ temperatur when the parallel temper method is
use these correl impli the need to perform long simul so that the statist
error are suffici small that the correl do not introduc artifici conclus
we believ that the method use in thi work could be appli to a varieti of other
system includ cluster of complex compar to lj38 for instanc the 75atom
lennardjon cluster is known to share mani featur with the 38atom cluster investig here lj75 is also character by a doubl funnel energi landscap one funnel be
associ with icosahedr structur and the other funnel be associ with the decahedr global minimum the landscap of lj75 ha been recent investig by doy
miller and wales6 who have use q6 as the order paramet in anoth paper2 wale and
doy have predict that the temperatur where the decahedralicosahedr equilibrium
take place should be close to 009kb thi predict is made by use the superposit method but no calor curv have yet been report for lj75 the parallel temper
mont carlo method can be expect to work well for lj75 and such a parallel temper
studi would be anoth good test case for theoret method discuss in thi work
a use enhanc of parallel temper mont carlo is the use of multipl histogram
methods1341 that enabl the calcul of thermodynam function in both the canon
and microcanon ensembl by the calcul of the microcanon entropi in practic
the multipl histogram method requir the gener of histogram of the potenti energi
at a set of temperatur such that there is appreci overlap of the potenti energi
distribut at adjac temperatur thi overlap requir is ident to the choic
of temperatur need in parallel temper
in perform simul on lj38 we have tri other method to reduc ergod
error and we close thi section by summar the difficulti we have encount with
these altern method it is import to recogn that the parallel temper simul
includ in excess of 1010 mont carlo point and most of our experi with these altern
method have come from significantli shorter simul our abil to includ thi larg
number of mont carlo point with parallel temper is an import reason whi we feel
parallel temper is so use
from experi with other smaller and simpler cluster for a jwalk simul
to includ 1010 point an extern distribut contain at least 109 point is requir
to prevent oversampl of the distribut such a larg distribut is prohibit with
current comput technolog our jwalk simul contain about 107 mont carlo
point have result in data that have not been intern reproduc and data that are not
in good agreement with the parallel temper data mani long jwalk simul with
configur initi at random onli have icosahedr structur at the lowest calcul
temperatur to stabil the jwalk method with respect to the inclus of truncat
octahedr structur at low temperatur we have attempt to gener distribut use
the modifi potenti energi function um r ur q4 in thi modifi potenti
is a paramet chosen to deepen the octahedr basin without significantli distort the
cluster while thi modifi potenti ha led to more stabl result than jwalk use
the bare potenti the result with 108 mont carlo point have not been reproduc in
detail the applic of tsalli distributions24 ha not improv thi situat
we have also tri to appli the multicanon jwalk approach recent introduc
by xu and berne25 while thi multicanon approach ha been shown to improv the
origin jwalk strategi for other cluster system in the case of lj38 the iter need
to produc the extern multicanon distribut have not produc truncat octahedr
structur the iter have produc extern distribut have either liquidlik
structur or structur from the icosahedr basin the multicanon distribut is known
to have defici at low energi and thi low energi difficulti appear to be problemat
for lj38 we have attempt to solv these defici by includ prior inform about
the thermodynam of the system in thi attempt we have chosen the multicanon weight
to be wmu u expspt u where spt u is the microcanon entropi extract from
a multihistogram analysis1341 of a parallel temper mont carlo simul in sever
attempt use thi approach we have not observ either the truncat octahedr structur
nor structur from the icosahedr basin with signific probabl the multicanon
distribut so gener is domin by liquidlik structur and the distribut appear
to be incap of captur the solidtosolid transit that lead to the low temperatur
peak in cv t v whether there are other approach to gener a multicanon
distribut that are more success in captur low temperatur behavior is unknown to
us
much insight about phase chang behavior can be obtain from simul in the
microcanon ensembl or use molecular dynam method for exampl the van der
waal loop observ in lj55 13 complement the interpret of the canon calor curv
in the next paper27 we present parallel temper result for lj38 use both molecular
dynam and microcanon mont carlo method
