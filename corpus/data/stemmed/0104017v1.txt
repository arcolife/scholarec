dedic to sergio doplich and john robert
abstract these note hope provid an aid to the comprehens
of the connesmoscovici and conneskreim work by isol common mathemat featur of the connesmoscovici root tree and
feynmangraph hopf algebra as a new special branch of the theori of
hopf algebra expect to becom import we discuss in particular
the dual milnormoor situat
1 charact and infinitesim charact of hopf algebra
in what follow k is a commut field of zero characterist eg k c r
remind 11 the algebrac dual of hopf algebra let h m 1 e1 s
be a hopf algebra over k consid the algebra dual h m 1 e 1
mt et s s t of h endow with the topolog of simpl converg on h
the valu of h for h h is denot by h then

we now investig two subset of h which map into h h the
charact and infinitesim charact of h

doe not vanish we denot by charh the set of charact of h note
that the counit is a charact of h

and that z vanish on the squar h2 of the augment ideal h
ker note also that 15 is the infinitesim form of 13 written for
z with z consid as small
we denot by charh the set of infinitesim charact of h
proposit 13 with the definit in 12 we have that

check of the second line 214 equat the deriv at 0 of z s sz
in practic recogn a bideriv often occur by first establish the
deriv properti and afterward the coderiv properti use
lemma 23 assum that one know that a bialgebra h is ngrade as an
algebra for investig the possibl coderiv properti of y one need onli
look at the restrict of y on a set of gener
proof from

a b homogen we conclud for the product ab with coproduct ab a1 b3
a2 b4 that y ab y a y b equal
y a1 b3 y a2 b4 y a1 y b3 y a2 y b4
it is instruct to check instead the properti 211 show that
y idh idh y ab

we next show that the algebrac dual of a ngrade coalgebra is a ngrade

proposit 25 ngrade connect bialgebra let

equival of a and b sinc the bialgebra ngrade entail that one ha

the consequ 218 of ngrade connected play a promin technic
role both in the connesmoscovici index theori and in the conneskreim theori
we defin p h h 1 1 gh h
written with quotat mark becaus h is not a bonafid coalgebra thi notat becom
bonafid in h cf section 1
note that the properti y h y h y h of the hopf ngrade mere entail that

daniel kastler
of renorm we therefor cast the special name of progress for thi
properti 25ii abov then say that a ngrade connect bialgebra is progress

hold for hh by i
remark 26 i progress at larg follow from progress for gener of h inde
ii let h kh if 218 hold for h and k it hold for the product hk
proof i follow from ii and the multipl of
ii assum that h h 1 1 h h h with all y h y h strictli
posit and k k 1 1 k k k with all y k y k strictli posit
it follow that
hk

h k h h h k k k k k k k h k h k
where all the tensor product but the two first have both factor of strictli posit
degre
we now present two import consequ of progress the first is
that it make automat the exist of a recurs defin antipod
proposit 27 assum that the ngrade bialgebra hm e nn hn
is ngrade connect thu progress then h is a hopf algebra
proof the requir for the clinear sr resp sl hh

sr h h h sr h h h ker
say that idh sr midh sr e
220
in fact it alreadi play the role in the earli day of the theori of hopf algebra through
the correspond induct definit of the antipod cf proposit 27

say that idh sl msl idh e

determin sr and sl by induct wrt the degre y as respect right and left
convolut invers of idh for the convolut product of endc h h but these
then coincid becaus sl idh sr e sr sr sl e sl thu s sr sr
is a bilater convolut invers of idh thu the uniqu antipod
the second consequ of progress of h is that given hh there is a
drastic limit depend on h of nonvanish valu h h we
recal that cf section 1
the algebrac dual h of h becom a topolog algebra if equip with
the h htopolog and the algebrastructur m 1 e 1 stem
from the coalgebrastructur of h
the subalgebra h gener in h by the unit 1 and the liealgebra l
of infinitesim charact becom by transposit a hopf algebra h m

lemma 28 let the bialgebra hm e nn hn be ngrade connect

where indic the annihil in the dual
proof i sinc by 217 a gener element of h is of the form 1 h with

proof of the implic 222 to assum that h belong to h the project

we cast a special name for a type of hopf algebra play a preval role in

31
we shall write indiffer hh symmetr tensor product or hh product of

the algebra h is also defin as the univers envelop uv of the liealgebra v with
