a lax pair for the 2d euler equat
thi is to report that a lax pair for the 2d euler equat is found we write the 2d euler
equat in the vortic form
0
11
t
where is the vortic is the stream function and the bracket is defin as
f g x f y g y f x g
let us denot the xdirect and the ydirect veloc by u and v respect then
u
v u
v
y
x
x y
the lax pair is given as
l
t a 0
12
where
l
a
and is a complex constant and is a complexvalu function the compat condit
of the lax pair 12 give the 2d euler equat 11 ie
t l l a
where l a la al give the lax represent of the 2d euler equat 11
remark 11 with the recent develop on chao in partial differenti equat 1 2
3 i am interest in build a dynam system theori for 2d euler equat under period boundari condit 4 5 in particular i am investig the exist vs nonexist of homoclin structur for such studi it will be fundament import to find
a lax pair if it exist for the 2d euler equat then i start with vladimir zakharov
paper 6 zakharov propos the lax pair
d1 0
t d2 s 0
2
where
d1
x
y
d2
x
y
and are real constant is a complex constant s is a realvalu function and
is a complexvalu function the compat condit of thi lax pair give the follow
equat instead of the 2d euler equat
t
s 0
d1 s d2
