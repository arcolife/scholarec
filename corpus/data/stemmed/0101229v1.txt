abstract we give a qanalysi version of a discretizaton procedur of kemmoku and
saito lead to an appar new qmoyal type bracket
1 introduct
we are pursu further some of the direct spell out in 2 relat moyalweylwign theori hirota formula integr system and discret with addit
connect involv quantum group cf 1 3 in thi note we indic an appar
new qmoyal type bracket formula aris in thi context in particular we follow here
framework from 2 16 17 for deform quantiz and integr system and refer
to 1 3 and refer cite there for qanalysi and quantum group one object
will be to examin variou formula aris in the deform of integr system and
see if there are quantum group version further we are look for qanalysi version
of deform quantiz formula in order to compar qcalculu and quantum group
theori with deform quantiz thu for background one recal for wave function
there are wigner function wf given via

we emphas also that mani formula in classic integr system alreadi have a

moyal deform kp m of dkp which for a particular valu of 12 in 2 13
creat an equival kp m kp sato actual qm featur in integr sysem
seem inevit becaus of lax oper formul and the combinator inher in
hirota equat and tau function also earli work by the kyoto school provid mani
connect between kp and quantum field theori qft cf 4 such connect have
sinc prolifer in topolog field theori tft seibergwitten sw theori etc where
eg effect action can correspond to tau function of integr sysem and somewhat
paradox effect slow dynam or whitham dynam obtain by averag out
fast fluctuat of angl variabl seem to correspond to a quantiz cf 2 chapter
5 or 5 for discuss on the other hand the so call quantum invers scatter method
involv spin chain etc for quantum integr system cf 2 10 ha a definit
quantum group natur where the rmatrix provid quasitriangular the connect
between r and r matric lead one back to classic dynam but the theori for two
type of integr system classic and quantum have develop along differ path
it seem that variou discret involv classic integr system survey in 2
should have a qanalysi foundat and thu there may be other form of connect glue
between classic and quantum integr system via discret inde one almost
seem to expect a discret formul to automat have quantum featur

remark 21 note y is fix throughout so the calcul make sens and thi
reveal also a properti of jackson integr a4 name they do not seem to use the
integr variabl x at all although chang of variabl techniqu should work we
emphas that care is need in use 25 in the form q2 when comput q2 gy gy
in 25 is not the same as q2 unless provis is made for c
thu q2 defin via
if we tri to comput q2 gy without keep constant there aris an awkward term

q2 gy one must write 12gi 2 gy 1 q 2 y1 gq 2 y gy q2 gy
as desir if we regard thi as a gener viabl procedur of transfer standard
differenc techniqu in to qanalysi then constant step for ani y correspond to
constant step 1 q 2 y which mean for larg y q 1 so if g is continu for exampl
then

for y y 2 q 2 y and for t larg y 2 y correspond to q 2 1 there seem
to be no reason not to use the q correspond in gener as long as comput
consist is maintain
remark 22 we will eventu dispens with altogeth in rephras matter
entir in q so that q2 or q will not aris

it should be possibl now to duplic most of the machineri in section 2 with q discret as abov we note that thi procedur and the result formula appear to be
differ from ani of the phase space discret in 6 8 11 14 18 19 22 23 24 26 27
we will consid an analogu of xfd in a9 or 223 via

thi is essenti the same as 1 xfd except for the gq m n factor for esthet reason
one prefer the form 1 xfd g sinc it ha the more visibl meaning form 416 and play
a consist role cf remark 41 below thu in summari

thi is reminisc of 44 but with a gq m n factor so the calcul 414 appli
with gq m n insert and consequ f gm g f m as befor although thi is
not immedi visibl from 427 we note also from 425 or 427 that it doe no
harm to use altern a form base on 223 in the form cf 418

come out of the integr sign as in the continu version of section 2 they have to
be sum note the correspond x a1 1 correspond to 1 x q m use
in a differ manner so it is at first glanc surpris that 2 xfd even come close to 1 xfd
the relat of our formula to the star product and moyal bracket of 310 313 will
be examin later as well as the expans of materi in 2 relat to work of curtright
fairli zacho and the saito school cf 2 for refer we note also that for a complex
phase space z not clarifi an interest variat on the qmoyal bracket of 414
or 425 is given in 17 for a kp situat cf also 2 where thi is expand thi is
appli to a kp hierarchi context use complex variabl method and although power
of q are insert in variou place it is not develop systemat in a qanalysi manner
and no recours to qderiv is indic we will expand further the treatment of 2
for thi situat in a subsequ paper
