introduct
to begin with we are go to consid the invers spectral problem for onedimension
schroding oper with period potenti in the late 60 the famou discoveri of the
invers scatter transform for the kdv equat wa done a period analog of thi
transform wa found in 1974 it is base on the solut of the follow invers spectral
problem
to describ effect the isospectr manifold of all the potenti with a given spectrum
on the line ie the spectrum of schroding oper act in the hilbert space of squar
integr complexvalu function on the line r
as everybodi work in the quantum solid state physic know thi spectrum gener is a union of infinit number of interv allow band on the energi line the
complementari part on the energi line is also a union of infinit number of interv gap
or forbidden band whose length tend to zero for
the period problem wa solv in 197475 for the socal finitegap potenti that
have onli a finit number of gap ani period potenti can be approxim by the
finitegap one thi solut involv combin of the theori of riemann surfac and
their function hamiltonian dynam of special complet integr system and the
spectral theori of schroding oper the mathemat techniqu use wa and still is
unusu for the commun of physicist later the necess to use thi kind of mathemat
appear also in other branch of mathemat and theoret physic for exampl in the
string theori matrix model and supersymmetr yangmil theori 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

the broad commun of theoret physicist
integr of the famou kdv equat ut 6uux uxxx wa discov in 196568 see
16 17 18 for the rapidli decreas initi data on the line x exact solut for the kdv
equat express ux t through the invers scatter data of the schroding oper
l x2 ux 0 were found thi procedur ha been call the invers scatter
transform ist it wa extend later for some other highli nontrivi 1 1system
includ such famou system as nonlinear schroding ns it xx 2 and
sinesinhgordon equat sg uxt sin u or uxt sinh u note that for the sg equat
a larg famili of exact solut wa alreadi construct in xix centuri by bianchi lie and
backlund see in 19 20 21 begin with 1974 sever 2 1dimension physic
interest system have been discov as integr by the ist procedur the most
famou of them is the kp system see 22 23
it is necessari to emphas that the ist procedur in it origin form can not be
appli to the solut of the period problem ie ux t is period in the variabl x
thi problem wa solv on the base of the new approach propos in 24 in the work
25 26 27 29 28 30 31see the survey 32 35 37 an extens of thi method to
2 1system wa found in 33 34 35 new develop of thi approach associ with
twodimension schroding oper wa start in 1976 see 36 37 39 38 41 42 43
complet detail descript of the solut of the period problem can be found in the
2
survey encyclopedia articl 40 and in the book 44 we are go to present here basic
idea of thi theori in the simplest form possibl let us point out that kdv as well as other
nontrivi complet integr by ist pde system are inde complet integr in ani
reason sens for rapidli decreas or period quasiperiod boundari condit
onli in fact even that is well establish for few of them for exampl for the kdv ani
period solut can be approxim by the finitegap solut thi statement easili
follow from the theori of finitegap potenti if we do not tri to preserv the period ie
in the class of all quasiperiod finitegap potenti the approxim of ani period
potenti by the finitegap potenti with exactli the same period wa construct on the
base of other approach develop in 46 the extens of the theori of riemann surfac
and function to the specif class of surfac of the infinit genu associ with period
schroding oper wa done in 47 thi theori is a beauti descript of the infinit
limit howev it seem that all fundament properti of function associ with the
complex continu of variabl are lost in thi limit it is interest to point out that
analog but more complic theori of riemann surfac of the infinit genu wa
develop later in 41 for the period 2d schroding oper
outsid these function class almost no effect inform is known beauti
method have been develop also for the studi of the special selfsimilar and stringtyp solut but in most case they lead to the veri hard analyt problem associ
with the famou painlev equat and their gener 48 49 50 51 53 52 54 55

rapidli decreas potenti and ggkm procedur b
acklund transform
let us recal the basic inform about the ist method for kdv we start from the socal
lax represent for kdv see 18 the heisenberg type equat for the schroding
oper l

is equival to the ident kdv equat
ut 6uux uxxx
23
for thi reason ani kdv type equat admit some analog of the lax represent is
call isospectr deform the exist of such deform indic the possibl
of effect solut of the invers scatter problem for the oper l

c b therefor a2 b2 1 the whole set of the socal
k or 0 we have a d
invers scatter data can be extract from the monodromi matrix t if it is welldefin
for all complex valu of k the socal scatter matrix is construct from t for the
real k it entri are the transmiss coeffici 1a and the reflect coeffici ba the
properti b 0 for all real valu of k character reflexionless or multisoliton potenti
for all rapidli decreas potenti the matrix element ak is welldefin for complex k
such that im k 0 and a 1 for k im k 0 there is onli a finit number of
pure imaginari zero akn 0 in thi domain they correspond to the discret spectrum

the latter equat give a full descript of kdv dynam in these variabl becaus ani
rapidli decreas potenti can be reconstruct from the invers scatter data a special
famili of the reflexionless potenti where b 0 for real valu of k lead to the socal
multisoliton solut for kdv equat see 44
the multisoliton solut can be also directli obtain with the help of the elementari
substitut baclund transform transform ani solut of the kdv into anoth
solut let u be a solut of the kdv equat and v be a solut of the ricatti equat

satisfi the kdv equat start from the trivial solut u u0 0 we construct
a sequenc of potenti un1 un n 0 given by the backlund transform we
choos paramet n 1 2 n and take the real nonzero function

in term of the schroding oper thi transform invent by leuler in 1742 is
call darboux transform the oper l can be factor

use the noncommut of these factor we defin the darboux transform for the
oper and it eigenfunct in the follow way

these transform can be consid as some kind of discret spectral symmetri for
schroding oper they preserv a spectrum of the oper l mayb except for one

spectral theori of period schr
oding oper
finitegap potenti
the spectral theori for the period potenti on the whole line x is base on the monodromi
matrix as in case of the scatter theori howev in the period case with a period
t we have noth like the select point x for the definit of the monodromi
matrix as it wa for the rapidli decreas case t see section 2 abov ani
point x0 can be use let us fix initi point x0 and choos a special basi of the solut
cx x0 sx x0 for the spectral equat lc c ls s such that for x x0 we
have
c s
c x sx
1 0
0 1
41
the shift oper t x x t in the basi c s defin the monodromi matrix
a b
c d
t x0
cx t a cx b sx sx t c cx d sx
42
43
the key element of the period spectral theori is a notion of the socal bloch wave or
blochfloquet eigenfunct we present here some essenti properti of these function
without ani proof an exposit of thi theori may be found in the encyclopedia articl
40 where the main idea of the proof are clearli present for the differ schroding
oper it is much simplier
by definit the blochfloquet function are solut of the schroding equat that
are at the same time eigenfunct of the shift oper ie
l t x x t expipt x
44
we uniqu normal by the condit xx0 1
for ani complex number the eigenvalu w exppt of the shift oper
are defin by the characterist equat for the monodromi matrix from the wronskian
properti it follow that det t 1 therefor the characterist equat ha the form
w 2 tr t w 1 0

45
figur 1
the multivalu function p is call quasimomentum
the spectrum of the schroding oper on the whole line is a union of spectral zone
which are segment of the real line of the variabl where the quasimomentum is real the
latter condit is equival to the inequ
tr t 2 cospt 2
46
the typic graph of the function f cospt is present on the fig 1 in particular it
extrem point f 0 gener are locat insid of the gap ie for the open and
everywher dens set of period potenti we have f 1 at the extrem point and there
is onli one extrem point in each gap for some special case we may have f 1 at
the extrem point such point lie insid the spectral zone howev gener perturb
creat new small gap nearbi thi point see fig 2 thi point is a doubl point of period
or antiperiod spectrum with the boundari condit x x t

the riemann surfac of the blochfloquet function is defin by the equat
z 2 cospt
47
but thi surfac is nonsingular onli for the gener case when there are no doubl point of
the period or antiperiod problem for the schroding oper for the larg
the follow asymptot is valid for the gap see fig 3
1 the length of gap tend to zero with it rate depend on the smooth of the
potenti thi rate is exponenti for the analyt potenti
2 all gap are locat nearbi the point m 4 2 m2 t 2 and the distanc of gap from
thi point tend to zero
a nonsingular riemann surfac of the blochfloquet solut is defin with the help
of the equat
z 2 0 1 n
48
where 0 1 are simpl eigenvalu of the period and antiperiod spectral problem

figur 3 for the gener t period potenti the gap are locat near the
point m 4m2 t 2 for here m are the integ number
as it follow from the lax represent for all higher kdvn system 39 these boundari spectral point for the period oper l in the hilbert space l2 r of the squar
integr complexvalu function on xline are integr of motion for the kdv hierarchi
we can say that the riemann surfac of the blochfloquet solut as a whole is an
integr of motion for the kdv hierarchi how mani potenti correspond to the same
riemann surfac ie have the same spectrum in l2 r
the origin idea to introduc a special class of potenti for which thi problem can
be solv effect wa propos in 24 and is base on the kdv hierarchi thi idea
natur combin two differ way to describ the correspond isospectr manifold of
potenti both are in fact close relat to each other
9
the first approach use of the kdv hierarchi and hamiltonian dynam
let us consid a stationari equat for some linear combin of higher kdvn flow
39 it is an ordinari differenti equat that can be written in the form
in c1 in1 cn i0 cn1 i1 0
49
thi is a finitedimension hamiltonian system with n degre of freedom depend on
n 1 paramet c1 cn1 it is a complet integr hamiltonian system becaus
there is a pencil of the commut flow thi pencil coincid with the restrict of all
higher kdvm on thi stationari subset of function given by the equat 49 therefor
it gener nonsingular solut is expect to be a period or quasiperiod function of x
in the next section we shall construct for 49 some kind of the lax represent
n1
x qx x n
ck k
410
k1
use 2 2 traceless matric depend on the paramet and u ux polynomi in
the today terminolog some peopl call them loop group note that in all soliton system thi
loop have veri specif depend polynomi ration and in some exot exampl
ellipt function
lax represent 410 impli that an algebra riemann surfac defin by characterist equat
det zi p z 0
411
doe not depend on x and therefor is an integr of 49 the same riemann surfac can be
extract from the commut equat l a 0 which accord to 39 is equival
to 49
it should be emphas that the latter form of 49 ie the commut condit
for two ordinari differenti oper
l an
ck ank l a 0 l x2 u
412
wa consid formal ie local in the variabl x without ani period assumpt
as a pure algebra problem in 1920 see 63 64 even the formal algebra riemann
surfac 411 appear as a relat p l a 0
accord to our logic howev the correspond system of equat in the variabl x is
hamiltonian and complet integr therefor it gener solut is quasiperiod in x
contain a dens famili of period solut we may ask about the spectrum of the correspond oper l in l2 r and boundari of gap remark they exactli coincid
with the branch point of the riemann surfac defin by equat 411 therefor for
the period potenti which satisfi equat 49 the nonsingular spectral riemann surfac
of the blochfloquet solut is an algebra riemann surfac of genu g n the spectrum
of such an oper contain onli a finit number of gap 2j1 2j j 1 n
thi key step unifi the first approach with the second one below so the solut of
the invers spectral problem can be identifi with the process of solut of some special
famili of complet integr system use riemann surfac

the second approach period spectral theori in the hilbert space l2 r
for ani period schroding oper l 2 ux t0 t1 we have alreadi
defin the riemann surfac of blochfloquet solut with the help of the monodromi
matrix t for the finitegap potenti a graph of the function f cospt 12tr t is
highli degener see fig2 and compar with fig1 for all real and larg enough we have
f 1
onc again we ask how to describ all the potenti with the same finitegap spectrum
and what are addit variabl which uniqu defin a finitegap potenti it turn out
that these addit spectral data are the pole of the blochfloquet function it can by
shown that the blochfloquet solut defin by 44 and normal by the condit
xx0 1 have exactli one simpl pole j x0 insid each gap or on it boundari a
point of the hyperellipt surfac 48 can be repres as the complex number and
a sign or a branch of the radic z 0 1 the branch of the radic
coincid at the boundari of gap therefor each gap should be consid as a close
cycl aj j 1 2 n see fig 4 ani pole of should be consid as a point j on the
cycl aj the abovement statement that there is onli one pole in a gap mean in
particular that ha no pole at the point j if it alreadi ha pole at j and vice
versa geometr the total set of pole 1 n repres a point on the real toru
t g a1 an as we shall see later thi set of pole complet determin the origin
potenti differ point of the real toru lead to the differ potenti if normal
point x0 is fix

period analog of ggkm zero curvatur represent for the kdv hierarchi and corollari
as it wa emphas abov the definit of the monodromi matrix in the period case
depend on a choic of initi point x0 for differ choic of the initi point the correspond monodromi matric are conjug becaus they repres the same linear
transform in differ base therefor a depend of the monodromi matrix with
respect to the choic of the initi point x0 can be describ by the equat

1 the monodromi matrix t commut with
t 0
510
therefor they have common eigenvector it impli in particular that the blochfloquet
function is singlevalu on the algebra riemann surfac associ with the matrix

514
these point coincid with project of the zero of bloch wave as the function of
the variabl x or pole as the function of x0 see the next section
an origin approach to the solut of the invers spectral problem wa base on the
use of the follow trace type formula for the potenti

to some express of the potenti through the function avoid the calcul of the
eigenfunct see 25 27 29 31 the most beauti function formula for the
potenti wa obtain in the work 29
howev in the next section we shall not follow thi approach for solv the invers
problem which ha been outlin abov but use anoth approach propos for the first
time in the articl 32 see appendix base on the idea of ait it is possibl to calcul
all the famili of the blochfloquet function the origin approach ha been use later in
the problem where the effect calcul of eigenfunct is imposs like in the case
of higher rank commut od linear oper see for exampl 37

solut of the period and quasiperiod invers
spectral problem bakerakhiez function
we are go to solv the invers spectral problem for the finitegap potenti follow the
scheme propos in 33 34 35 and base on the concept of the bakerakhiez function
these function are uniqu defin by their analyt properti on the spectral riemann
surfac as we shall see later thi scheme is evenli applic to the solut of invers
problem in twodimension case where the correspond analyt properti natur
gener the analyt properti of the blochfloquet solut for finitegap schroding
oper
let us start with the follow real invers spectral data
14
1 riemann surfac given in the form
z 2 0 2n
where all number j are real
2 a set of n real point j such that there is exactli one point j on the cycl aj
below we shall for breviti identifi the point j as a point on with it project on
complex plane the condit that there is onli one point on each cycl mean that
project of the point satisfi the restrict
2j1 j 2j j 1 n
61
by definit the complex invers spectral data are the same data where the riemann surfac
ie it branch point k and the point j are arbitrari complex point
as we shall see below a gener set of algebraicgeometr spectral data lead to the
explicit solut of the invers spectral problem in term of the riemann thetafunct the
correspond potenti are complex meromorph quasiperiod function of the variabl x
for the real data describ abov we are come to the smooth even analyt quasiperiod
potenti with their period express through the hyperellipt integr see below it is
necessari to mention that there is no way to find simpl and effect criteria for the potenti
to be period in term of these data the period depend on the riemann surfac onli
of cours we may write the condit that all the correspond hyperellipt integr are
commensur howev thi condit in transcendent recent base on the result of
7 65 the effect numer approach ha been develop for the solut of thi problem
it is base on the discoveri of some specif dynam system on the set of potenti which
preserv all the period but chang spectrum follow 65 we start from one period
potenti and creat all other use these dynam system
in the last section we shall present some exampl of finitegap potenti written in term
of ellipt function they are period in the variabl x even doubleperiod as function
of the complex variabl x the first nontrivi exampl differ from the classic lame
potenti ux nn 1x were found in 25 thi subject wa develop in the work
66 67 68 69 70
we defin the bakerakhiez function x t1 tn p for the paramet x tj and
the point p by it analyt properti on with respect to the variabl p
for the case t1 t2 0 these analyt properti are just the same as the analyt
properti of the blochfloquet solut of the period finitegap oper
from pure algebraicgeometr argument it follow that there exist a uniqu function
such that
1 it is meromorph on outsid the infin and ha at most simpl pole at the point
j j 1 n
2 in a neighborhood of the infin the function ha the form
expxk t1 k 3 k 2n1 tn 1 1 x tk 1
15
where k 2 and therefor k 1 is a local coordin on the riemann surfac near infin
a proof of thi statement is ident to the proof of the exist and uniqu of gener bakerakhiez function that were introduc in 33 for construct of exact solut
of twodimension kp equat and all associ zakharovshabat hierarchi
gener bakerakhiez function is defin with the help of an arbitrari riemann surfac
of finit genu n instead of special hyperellipt ie twosheet surfac we fix an
arbitrari infin point p0 on it local coordin k 1 w where wp0 0 gener set of
point 1 n and number x 1 2 k the correspond bakerakhiez
function ha the same analyt properti as abov but 2 is replac by the follow
expxk 1 k 2 2 k 3 1 1 x k 1
62
for the kdv hierarchi we have a hyperellipt riemann surfac k 2 and 2k 0 2j1
tj
the use of such type of function depend onli on a singl paramet x ha been
propos by baker in hi note 71 for the common eigenfunct of two commut od
linear oper he expect that thi construct will improv the result of 63 64 he
made also veri interest conjectur that thi approach may serious improv the classic
theori of function unfortun thi program wa not realiz and wa forgotten the
soliton theori appear mani decad later absolut independ in the 70 it start
to use such kind of function on riemann surfac in the process of solut of a period
problem for the kdv type system and invers spectral period problem in the classic
spectral theori akhiez 72 wa the first to use some special case of thi function for the
construct of some exampl of oper on the halflin x 0 with interest spectral
properti no one of the author befor the 70 had associ anyth like that with
period problem inde thi type of function construct on the riemann surfac wa
extract in 1974 from the work 72
we shall prove the exist and uniqu of the bakerakhiez function and present
it exact express through the function later at thi moment we would like to show
how the uniqu of thi function lead to the proof that is an eigenfunct for the
schroding oper for our special case appli twice the oper x to thi function
and use analyt properti after elementari calcul we are come to the formula
k expkx 1x k 1
2 k 2 21x ok 1 expkx
63
from the latter equat we get the equal
2 k 2 21x ok 1 expkx
the lefthand side is global welldefin function on the same riemann surfac becaus
k 2 it ha the same pole independ of paramet up to the same exponenti factor
it is of the order ok 1 at the infin therefor it is equal to zero due to the uniqu
of the bakerakhiez function
16
so we are come to the conclus that
l l 2 u u 21x
64
we can appli the oper j tj to the function
j k 2j1 expkx 1j k 1 2j k 2
65
as in the previou case we can easili construct a linear oper aj x2j1 with the
coeffici independ of k such that j an ok 1 expkx use global
analyt properti on the riemann surfac we deduc from thi that the lefthand side is
equal to zero as befor the compat condit of these pair of equat is exactli a
kdvn system for the potenti ux t1 tm
follow the work 33 34 35 we can prove in the same way that for the gener
bakerakhiez function x p associ with arbitrari riemann surfac with fix
local coordin near a punctur the follow equat are valid
k lk 0 k 2 3
66
here lk xk are linear od oper act on the variabl x with coeffici depend on paramet these coeffici are differenti polynomi in the coeffici of
the expans of the regular factor of the bakerakhiez function at the punctur infin
they are uniqu defin by the condit that the expans of the lefthand side of 66
at the punctur ha the form ok 1
the compat condit
j lj k lk 0
67
are equival to nonlinear partial differenti equat for the coeffici of the oper
lk for the case j 2 k 3 2 y 3 z the oper l2 and l3 have the form
3
l2 x2 ux y t l3 x3 ux wx y t
2
68
where we consid the depend of the coeffici with respect to the first three variabl
1 x 2 y 3 t onli the coeffici ux y t is equal to u 21x x y t where 1 is
the first coeffici of the expans 62
from 67 we get a system of two equat for two coeffici ux y t and wx y t
which can be reduc for an equat for ux y t the reduc equat is the famou kp
equat
3uyi 4ut 6uux uxxx x
69
it appear in physic literatur for the investig of the transvers stabil of the kdv
soliton see 73 and is one of the most natur physic twodimension analog of kdv
lax represent for it wa found in 22 23 we call the whole set of higher system 67
the kp hierarchi we shall discuss the period problem for thi equat at greater length
in the next section
17
for the special choic of the hyperellipt riemann surfac and k we have k 2s s
where the function is welldefin global as a meromorph function on the riemann
surfac therefor we may repres global the correspond bakerakhiez function
in the form
exp2 k 2 4 k 4
610
where doe not depend on the paramet 2j so in thi case all the kp hierarchi reduc
to the kdv hierarchi
the relationship of thi construct with commut od linear oper is as follow
let f p be a meromorph function on the riemann surfac with one pole at the punctur
p0 it neg part written in the paramet k is some polynomi qk q1l q2 k l1
ql k appli the oper af q1 ll q2 ll1 q1 x to the function by the
definit of the oper lk we can see that
af f ok 1
611
we conclud as befor that the differ af f p 0
for ani pair of function f and g on the riemann surfac with pole at the point
we get a pair of the commut od scalar linear oper af ag such that af ag ag af
in a special case of the hyperellipt riemann surfac z 2 0 2n we have pair
of function f g z lead to the schroding oper l x2 u commut with
the second oper of order 2n 1 becaus z k 2n1
now we return back to the problem of exist and uniqu of the bakerakhiez
function the simplest way to prove thi exist is to defin thi function by exact formula in term of the function and meromorph differenti let us recal first necessari
inform
as in the previous discuss case of hyperellipt curv we introduc a basi of cycl
aj bj j 1 g on a riemann surfac of genu g with canon matrix of intersect
ai bj ij and a basi i of holomorph differenti normal by the condit
ai
j ij
612
the matrix b bij of bperiod of these differenti
bij
bi
j
613
is symmetr and ha posit defin imaginari part the riemann function is a function
defin with the help of thi matrix by the formula
e2izmbmm
zb
614
mz g
where z z1 zg is a complex gdimension vector m z stand for a standard scalar
product and summat is taken over all integ vector m m1 mg thetafunct
18
is an entir period function of g variabl zj and ha the follow monodromi properti
with respect to the shift defin by vector bk which are column of the matrix of bperiod
z bk e2izk ibkk z
615
the basic vector ek and the vector bk defin a lattic l in c g which determin gdimension complex toru j c g l call jacobian of the curv the abel map
a j is defin by the formula
ak p
p
p0
k
616
note that the vector ap with coordin ak p depend on the choic of path of integr but it ambigu just coincid with shift by vector of the lattic l
from the monodromi properti of function it follow that zero of the multivalu
function ap z consid as a function on are welldefin for a gener vector
z thi function ha exactli g zero 1 g the vector z can be express in term of
abel transform of these point by the formula
g
z
aj k
617
j1
where k is a vector of the riemann constant
let us introduc a set of meromorph differenti di that are holomorph on outsid
the punctur where they have pole of the form
di dk i 1 ok i1
618
and normal in a usual way by the condit
ai
dj 0
the abelian integr
i p
p
619
di
620
dj
621
are multivalu function on
let uj be a vector with the coordin
ujk
1
2i
bk
then from the statement present abov it follow directli that the formula
i i p
p exp
i
ap i ui i zz
ap z i ui i z
622
correctli defin a function on which satisfi all the properti of the bakerakhiez
function
19
suppos now that there exist anoth bakerakhiez function 1 from the definit
the bakerakhiez function it follow that the ratio 1 is a meromorph function on
which is equal to 1 at the punctur and with onli possibl pole at the zero of the function
accord to 622 the zero of are zero of the function ap i ui i z
therefor ha g zero the simplest form of the riemannroch theorem which can be
consid as gener of the liouvil theorem for riemann surfac impli that a
function on with at most g pole at a gener set of point is a constant therefor 1
and the exist and uniqu of the bakerakhiez function is prove
now accord to the previous establish formula u 2x 1 in order to get an exact
formula for a solut of the kp hierarchi it is enough to take the first coeffici 1 of
the expans of the preexponenti factor in 62 at the punctur final we obtain the
express
623
u 2x2 log ui i z const
i
for the finit gap solut of the whole kp hierarchi
if we consid onli the kp equat we get the formula
ux y t 2x2 log ux v y w t z const
624
where we redenot x 1 y 2 t 3 and u u1 v u2 w u3
for the case of the hyperellipt curv the vector v 0 and we get the itsmatveev
formula for the finitegap solut of the kdv equat
the formula 624 deriv in 34 35 ha led to one of the most import pure mathemat applic of the theori of nonlinear integr system thi is the solut of
the famou riemannshottki problem
accord to the torrelli theorem the matrix of bperiod of normal holomorph differenti uniqu defin the correspond algebra curv the riemannshottki problem
is to describ symmetr matric with the posit imaginari part which are the matric
of bperiod of normal holomorph differenti on algebra curv one of the author
conject that the function ux y t given by 624 is a solut of the kpequat iff the
matrix b that defin the thetafunct is the matrix of bperiod of normal holomorph
differenti on an algebra curv and u v w are vector of bperiod of correspond normal meromorph differenti with the onli pole at a point of thi curv thi conjectur
wa prove in 74

spectral theori of twodimension period oper kp hierarchi
a gener algebraicgeometr construct of the finitegap potenti for the schroding
oper and for solut of the kp hierarchi that wa present in the previou section
ha been develop extens in year it is applic for all soliton system which are
20
equival to variou type of compat condit for overdetermin system of auxiliari linear problem in it algebra form it is in some sens local and is a sort of invers
transform from a set of algebraicgeometr data to solut of the integr nonlinear
partial differenti equat
algebra geometr data solut of nlp de
71
in a gener case the space of algebraicgeometr data is a union for all g of the space
gn g p k1 q 1 g 1 n
m
72
where g is an algebra curv of genu g with fix local coordin k1 q k1 p 0
in neighborhood of n punctur p and 1 g are point of g in a gener posit
gn are univers data for the given nonlinear integr
it is to be mention that m
equat the correspond subset of data ha to be specifi
aposteriori it can be shown that these solut can be express in term of the correspond riemann thetafunct and are quasiperiod function of all variabl whithin
thi approach it is absolut imposs to give an answer to the basic question how
mani algebraicgeometr solut are there and what is their role in the solut of the
period cauchi problem for twodimension equat of the kp type
the answer of the correspond question in lower dimens is as follow for finit
dimension 01 system a typic lax represent ha the form
t ut ut v t
73
where ut and v t are matrix function that are ration or sometim ellipt
function of the spectral paramet in that case all the gener solut are algebraicgeometr and can be repres in term of the riemann thetafunct
for spatial onedimension evolut equat of the kdv type 11system the
exist of direct and invers spectral transform allow one to prove though it is not
alway the rigor mathemat statement that algebraicgeometr solut are dens
in the space of all period in x solut
it turn out that the situat for twodimension integr equat is much more
complic for one of the real form of the kp equat that is call the kp2 equat
and coincid within 69 the algebraicgeometr solut are dens in the space of all
period in x and y solut 41 it seem that the same statement for the kp1 equat
which can be obtain from 69 be replac y iy is wrong one of the most import
problem in the theori of twodimension integr system which are still unsolv is in
what sens the kp1 equat ahich ha the oper represent 67 and for which a
wide class of period solut wa construct is an nonintegr system
the proof of the integr of the period problem for the kp2 equat is base on
the spectral floquet theori of the parabol oper
m y x2 ux y
21
74
with period potenti ux l1 y ux y l2 ux y we are go now to present
the most essenti point of thi theori which wa develop in 41 it is the natur
gener of the spectral theori of the period sturmliouvil oper we would
like to mention that despit it applic to the theori of nonlinear equat and relat
topic the structur of the riemann surfac of bloch solut of the correspond linear
equat that wa found in 41 ha been use as a start point for an abstract definit
of the riemann surfac of the infinit genu 75
solut x y w1 w2 of the nonstationari shroding equat
y x2 ux yx y w1 w2 0
75
with a period potenti ux y ux a1 y ux y a2 are call bloch solut if
they are eigenfunct of the monodromi oper ie
x a1 y w1 w2 w1 x y w1 w2
76
x y a2 w1 w2 w2 x y w1 w2
77
the bloch function will alway be assum to be normal so that 0 0 w1 w2 1
the set of pair q w1 w2 for which there exist such a solut is call the floquet set
and will be denot by the multivalu function pq and eq such that
w1 eipa1 w2 eiea2
are call quasimomentum and quasienergi respect
the gaug transform ehi where y hy is a period function transfer the
solut of 75 into solut of the same equat but with anoth potenti u uy h
consequ the spectral set correspond to the potenti u and u are isomorph
therefor in what follow we restrict ourselv to the case of period potenti such that
a1
0 ux ydx 0
to begin with let us consid as a basic exampl the free oper m0 y x2 with
zero potenti ux y 0 the floquet set of thi oper is parameter by the point
1 2
of the complex plane of the variabl k w10 eika1 w20 e k a2 and the bloch solut
1 2
1 2
have the form x y k eikx k y the function x y k eikx k y are bloch
solut of the formal adjoint oper y x2 0
an imag of the map k c w10 w20 is the floquet set for the free oper m0 it
is the riemann surfac with selfintersect the selfintersect correspond to the pair
k k such that wi0k wi0k i 1 2 the latter condit impli the equat
k k

78
where n and m are integ henc all the reson point have the form
k knm

n 0 k knm

22
79
the basic idea of the construct of the riemann surfac of bloch solut of the equat
75 that wa propos in 41 is to consid 75 as a perturb of the free oper
assum that the potenti ux y is formal small
for ani k0 knm it is easi to construct a formal bloch solut it turn out that the
correspond formal seri converg and defin a holomorph function of k0 for k0 m
big enough and lie outsid small neighborhood of the reson point moreov it can be
shown that thi function can be extend on the riemann surfac that can be thought as a
surfac obtain from the complex plane by some kind of surgeri that creat gap in place
of the reson point
more precis if ux y is a smooth real potenti that ha analyt continu in
some neighborhood of the real valu of x and y then the correspond riemann surfac
of blochfloquet solut can be describ in the follow way
let us fix some finit or infinit subset s of integ pair n 0 m the set of pair
of complex number ps1 ps2 where s s would be call admiss if
re psi
n
psi ks ok 1 i 1 2
a1
710
and the interv ps1 ps2 do not intersect here ks s n m are reson point
let us defin the riemann surfac for ani admiss set it is obtain from the
complex plane of the variabl k by cut it along the interv ps1 ps2 and
ps1
ps2
and by sew after that the left side of the first cut with the right side of the second cut
and vice versa after thi surgeri for each cut ps1 ps2 correspond to a nontrivi cycl
as on
for ani real period potenti ux y which can be analyt extend into some
neighborhood of the real valu x y the bloch solut of the equat 75 are parameter by point q of the riemann surfac correspond to some admiss set
the function x y q which is normal by the condit 0 0 q 1 is meromorph
on and ha a simpl pole s on each cycl as if the admiss set contain onli a
finit number of pair then ha finit genu and is compactifi by onli one point p1
k in the neighborhood of which the bloch function ha the form 62
the potenti u for which ha finit genu are call finitegap they coincid with
the algebraicgeometr potenti the direct spectral transform for period oper
74 allow us to prove that like in the onedimension case the finitegap potenti are
dens in the space of all period smooth function in two variabl 41
8
spectral theori of twodimension schr
oding oper for fix energi level and twodimension
toda lattic
in thi section we discuss a spectral theori of twodimension period schoding oper
unlik the onedimension case spectral data for 2d linear oper are overdetermin
23
and therefor for gener oper there are no nontrivi isospectr flow as it wa note
in 77 deform that preserv spectral data for one fix energi level do exist an
analog of lax represent for such system ha the form
ht a h bh
81
where h a b are two dimension oper with coeffici depend on x y t equat
81 is equival to the condit that oper h and t a commut on the space of
solut of the equat h 0 therefor 81 describ deform preserv all the
spectral data associ with the zero energi level of the oper h
it should be mention that until the moment when equat 81 were propos in
the framework of the soliton theori the spectral problem associ with one energi level of
twodimension period oper had never been consid
for the first time an invers algebraicgeometr spectral problem for twodimension
schroding oper in magnet field
h ix ax x y2 iy ay x y2 ux y
82
wa formul and solv in 36
consid the bloch solut of the equat h which by definit are solut
that at the same time are eigenfuct for the shift oper
x t1 y eipx t1 x y x y t2 eipi t2 x y
83
here t1 t2 are period of the oper h ie period of the potenti ux y and period of
the magnet field bx y which is defin by the vector potenti ax ay by the formula
b y ax x ay
multivalu quantiti px py are compon of the twodimension quasimomentum
for fix valu of px py a spectrum of the oper h restrict on the space of function
satisfi 83 is discret and defin differ branch of dispers relat j px py j
1 level line j px py 0 in the space of variabl px py defin the socal fermi
curv of cours in the solid state physic all the consider were restrict by real
valu of quasimomentum
in 36 it wa suggest to consid oper for which a complex fermi curv doe
exist and is the riemann surfac of finit genu for some energi level 0 moreov it wa
assum that thi curv is compactifi by two infin point p in neighborhood of which
the correspond bloch solut have the form
ek xiy
s
s x yk
84
s0
1
where k
are local coordin in the neighborhood of the punctur p it wa also
assum that outsid the punctur the function x y p consid as a function of the
variabl p which is a point of the complex fermi curv is meromorph function with g
pole independ of the variabl x and y
24
we present here a solut to thi invers spectral problem in a more gener form which
is necessari for construct of exact solut to the twodimension toda lattic which
ha deep connect with the theori of 2d schroding oper after that we return
back to the spectral problem
let be a smooth algebra curv of genu g with fix local coordin w p in
neighborhood of the point p w p 0 then for each set of g point 1 g in
gener posit there exist a uniqu function n t p t t
i i 1 such that
10 the function n of the variabl p is meromorph outsid the punctur and ha
at most simpl pole at the point s if all of them are distinct
20 in a neighborhood of the point p it ha the form
s
s n t w
exp
n
n t p w
s0
i
w
ti
w w p
85
i1
0 x t j
86
the proof of thi statement as well as the explicit formula for n in term of riemann
thetafunct is almost ident to the way of solut of the invers problem for finitegap schroding oper discuss in the previou section
let dj be a uniqu meromorph differenti holomorph on outsid the point p
which ha the form
j
dj dw

87
near the point p and normal by the condit ak di
with coordin

0 it defin a vector uj
88
further let us defin the normal differenti d0 which is holomorph outsid the
point p where it ha simpl pole with residu 1 respect from riemann bilinear
relat it follow that the vector of bperiod of thi differenti equal 2iu 0 where
u 0 ap ap
89
as in the previou case one can directli check that the function n t p given by the
formula

is welldefin and ha all the properti of the bakerakhiez function
note that for n 0 and t
1 x iy ti 0 i 1 the analyt properti of thi
function coincid with the properti that were describ abov as analyt properti of
the bloch solut for finitegap twodimension schroding oper
25
from the uniqu of the bakerakhiez function n t p it follow that they satisfi
the linear equat
t

812
vn n t cn en t n1 t en 0 t
813
n n1 vn n n cn n1
where
and 0 t is a lead term of the expans of n at the punctur p from 810 we get
the formula

814
for algebraicgeometr solut of 2d toda lattic which wa obtain in 76
note that 812 impli that 0 satisfi the equat
0 v0 0 c1 v0 0
815
which is gaug equival to 82 and therefor we do get a solut of the invers problem
that wa introduc abov
the next import step wa done in 38 39 where algebraicgeometr spectral data
correspond to potenti 2d schroding oper ie oper with zero magnet field
were found
1
let be a smooth genu g algebra curv with fix local coordin k
q
0 in neighborhood of two punctur p let us assum that there exist a
holomorph involut of the curv such that p are it onli fix point
ie p p the local paramet are to be odd ie k q k q the
factorcurv will be denot by 0 the project

816
repres as a twosheet cover of 0 with the two branch point p in thi realiz
the involut is a permut of the sheet as there are onli two branch point
g 2g0 where g0 is genu of 0 let us consid a meromorph differenti dq of the
third kind on 0 with residu 1 at the point p the differenti d ha g zero that will
be denot by i i 1 2g0 g let us choos for each i a point i on such that
i i i 1 g
817
in 38 39 it wa shown that the bakerakhiez function correspond to algebraicgeometr data which have been just defin satisfi the equat
ux yx y q 0
818
u 1 1
819
where
26
and 1 1 x x are the first coeffici in the expans 84
it should emphas that though gener formula 810 in term of the riemann function is valid for the bakerakhiez function correspond to the potenti shroding
oper h in 38 39 it wa found anoth more effect represent in term of the
socal prim thetafunct
a space of holomorph differenti on split into two g0 dimension subspac of
even and odd with respect to the involut differenti a matrix of bperiod of odd
differenti defin the function p r z by the same formula 614 then
p r aod q u x u x zp r aod z ip qx p qx
e
p r aod q zp r u x u x z
820
here p q are abelian integr of the second kind normal differenti dp on that
have pole of the second order at the point p respect vector 2u are the vector
of bperiod of these differenti
as it wa mention abov the invers algebraicgeometr spectral problem on one energi
level for 2d schroding oper wa pose and solv at the time when no direct spectral
theori wa known thi theori wa develop much later in 41 where it wa shown that
the bloch solut for 818 with analyt period potenti are parameter by point
of infinit genu riemann surfac it wa prove that if thi surfac ha finit genu then
the bloch function have all the analyt properti suggest in the invers problem and
therefor are just the bakerakhiezerfunct moreov it wa prove that algebraicgeometr finitegap potenti are dens in the space of all period potenti

spectral theori of oper with ellipt coeffici
in thi section we are go to discuss a specif spectral problem for oper with ellipt
coeffici ie with the coeffici that are meromorph function of a variabl x and
have two period 2 2 im 0
sinc hermit time it ha been known that onedimension schroding oper with
potenti of the form nn 1x where x x is weierstrass function correspond to ellipt curv with period 2 2 and n is an integ ha onli n gap in the
spectrum these lame potenti had been the onli known exampl with the finitegap
properti befor the finitegap theori wa construct in the framework of the soliton theori
see abov as we alreadi have shown a gener algebraicgeometr potenti can be express in term of higher genu riemann function sometim higher genu formula can
be reduc to exact express in term of ellipt function
the first exampl of thi type which is differ from the lame potenti wa propos
in 25 later a theori of ellipt finitegap potenti attract the special interest due to
remark observ made in 78 on their connect with the ellipt calogeromos
model the most recent burst of interest is due to the unexpect connect of these
system to seibergwitten solut of n 2 supersymmetr gaug theori 14 15 it
27
turn out that the low energi effect theori for sun model with matter in the adjoint
represent identifi first in 1 with sun hitchin system is isomorph to the ellipt
cm system use thi connect quantum order paramet were found in 79
the ellipt calogeromos cm system 80 81 is a system of n ident particl

the cm system is a complet integr hamiltonian system ie it ha n independ

in 78 it wa shown that the ellipt solut of the kdv equat have the form
n
ux t 2
i1
x xi t
92
and the pole xi t of the solut satisfi the constraint ji xi xj 0 which is the
locu of the stationari point of the cm system moreov it turn out that the depend
of the pole with respect to t coincid with the hamiltonian flow correspond to the
third integr h3 of the system in 84 85 it wa found that thi connect becom
an isomorph in the case of the ellipt solut of the kadomtsevpetviashvilii equat
moreov in 66 it wa reveal that the connect of the cm system with the kp equat
is in some sens secondari and is a corollari of more fundament connect with spectral
theori of linear oper with ellipt potenti the correspond approach ha been
develop extens in 67 68 69
let l be a linear differenti or differ oper in two variabl x t with coeffici
which are scalar or matrix ellipt function of the variabl x we do not assum ani special
depend of the coeffici with respect to the second variabl then it is natur to
introduc a notion of doublebloch solut of the equat
l 0
93
we call a meromorph vectorfunct f x which satisfi the follow monodromi properti
f x 2 b f x 1 2
94
a doublebloch function the complex number b are call bloch multipli in other
word f is a meromorph section of a vector bundl over the ellipt curv
in the most gener form a problem that we are go to address is to classifi and to
construct all the oper l such that equat 93 ha suffici enough doublebloch
solut
it turn out that exist of the doublebloch solut is so restrict that onli in
except case such solut do exist a simpl and gener explan of that is due to
the riemannroch theorem let d be a set of point xi i 1 m on the ellipt curv
0 with multipl di and let v v d b1 b2 be a linear space of the doublebloch
28
function with the bloch multipli b that have pole at xi of order less or equal to di and
holomorph outsid d then the dimens of d is equal to
dim d deg d
di
i
now let xi depend on the variabl t then for f dt the function lf is a doublebloch function with the same bloch multipli but in gener with higher order of pole
becaus take deriv and multipl by the ellipt coeffici increas these order
therefor the oper l defin a linear oper
ld v dt b1 b2 v d t b1 b2 n deg d n deg d
and 93 is alway equival to an overdetermin linear system of n equat for n
unknown variabl which are the coeffici ci ci t of expans of v t with respect
to a basi of function fi t v t with some exagger one may say that in the
soliton theori the represent of a system in the form of the compat condit of
an overdetermin system of the linear problem is consid equival to integr
in all of the basic exampl n 2n and the overdetermin system of equat ha
the form
lc kc t c mc
95
where l and m are n n matrix function depend on a point z of the ellipt curv as
on a paramet a compat condit of 95 ha the standard lax form t l m l
and is equival to a finitedimension integr system
the basi in the space of the doublebloch function can be written in term of the
fundament function x z defin by the formula
x z
z x zx
e
zx
96
note that x z is a solut of the lame equat
d2
2x x z zx z
dx2
97
from the monodromi properti it follow that consid as a function of z is doubleperiod
x z 2 x z
though it is not ellipt in the classic sens due to an essenti singular at z 0 for
x 0
as a function of x the function x z is doublebloch function ie
x 2 z t zx z t z exp 2 z 2z
in the fundament domain of the lattic defin by 2 the function x z ha a uniqu
pole at the point x 0
x z x1 ox
98
29
the gaug transform f x fx f xeax where a is an arbitrari constant doe
not chang pole of ani function and transform a doubl blochfunct into anoth doublebloch function if b are bloch multipli for f then bloch multipli for f are equal to
1 b1 e2a1 b
2 b2 e2a2
b
99
the two pair of bloch multipli that are connect with each other through the relat
99 for some a are call equival note that for all equival pair of bloch multipli
the product b12 b21 is a constant depend on the equival class onli
from 98 it follow that a doublebloch function f x with simpl pole xi in the
fundament domain and with bloch multipli b such that at least one of them is not
equal to 1 may be repres in the form
n
f x
i1
ci x xi zekx
910
where ci is a residu of f at xi and z k are paramet relat by b t ze2 k ani
pair of bloch multipli may be repres in thi form with an appropri choic of the
paramet z and k
let us consid as an exampl the equat
l t x2 ux t 0
911
where ux t is an ellipt function then as shown in 66 equat 911 ha n linear
independ doublebloch solut with equival bloch multipli and n simpl pole at
point xi t if and onli if ux t ha the form
n
ux t 2
i1
x xi t
912
and xi t satisfi the equat of motion of the ellipt cm system 91
the assumpt that there exist n linear independ doublebloch solut with equival bloch multipli impli that they can be written in the form
n
i1
2
ci t k zx xi t zekxk t
913
with the same z but differ valu of the paramet k
let us substitut 913 into 911 then 911 is satisfi if and onli if we get a function
holomorph in the fundament domain first of all we conclud that u ha pole at xi
onli the vanish of the tripl pole x xi 3 impli that ux t ha the form 912
the vanish of the doubl pole x xi 2 give the equal that can be written as a
matrix equat for the vector c ci
lt z kic 0
30
914
where i is the unit matrix and the lax matrix lt z is defin as follow
1
lij t z ij x i 1 ij xi xj z
2
915
final the vanish of the simpl pole give the equat
t mt zc 0
where
mij z 2
ji
916
xi xj ij 21 ij xi xj z
917
the exist of n linear independ solut for 911 with equival bloch multipli
impli that 914 and 916 have n independ solut correspond to differ valu
of k henc as a compat condit we get the lax equat l m l which is
equival to 91 note that the last system doe not depend on z therefor if 914
and 916 are compat for some z then they are compat for all z as a result we
conclud that if 911 ha n linear independ doublebloch solut with equival
bloch multipli then it ha infinit mani of them all the doublebloch solut are
parameter by point of an algebra curv defin by the characterist equat
n
rk z detki lz k n
ri zk n i 0
918
i1
equat 918 can be seen as a dispers relat between two bloch multipli and
defin as nsheet cover of 0
as wa shown in 66 expans of the characterist equat 914 at z 0 ha the
form
n
rk z
k i z 1 hi oz 1 1 n i 1 i 1
919
i1
we call the sheet of at z 0 correspond to the branch k z 1 n 1 o1 an
upper sheet and mark the point p1 on thi sheet among the preimag of z 0 from 919
it follow that in gener posit when the curv is smooth it genu equal n
further consider of analyt properti of the function given by 913 where
ci are compon of the eigenvector to the matrix l show that thi function is just the
bakerakhiez function introduc in section 6 combin with express 622 for in
term of function thi result directli lead to the main statement of 66
the coordin of the particl xi t are root of the equat
ux v t z0 0
920
where b is the riemann thetafunct correspond to the matrix of bperiod
of holomorph differenti on the vector u and v are the vector of bperiod of normal meromorph differenti on with pole of order 2 and 3 at the point p1

among other exampl of integr system that can be gener in the similar way
are ruijesenaarsschneid system 86

as shown in 68 69 they are gener by spectral problem for equat
l t x t x t vx tx t 0
923
x m 1 x vx mx m
924
and
respect here is a complex number and vx t is an ellipt function
strang as it is the invers spectral problem which is discuss here is simplier for twodimension oper then for onedimension stationari oper for exampl a famili
of spectral curv correspond to oper 911 that have doublebloch solut can be
describ explicitli a nice formula wa found in 79
rk z f k z z f k z

925
where hk is a polynomi note that 925 may be written as
f k z

hk
the coeffici of the polynomi hk are free paramet of the spectral curv of the cm
system
the spectral curv correspond to the schroding oper with the same properti
are special case of the curv 925 but their explicit descript is unknown in particular
exact formula for branch point for lame potenti is unknown as it wa mention
abov the first exampl of ellipt finitegap potenti differ from the lame potenti
wa found in 25 a wide class of such potenti wa found in 70
in 88 it wa note that the problem of classif of schroding oper with ellipt
potenti that have two doublebloch solut for almost all energi level wa pose by
picard though had not been solv until veri recent in 88 use floquet spectral theori
for the schroding oper it wa prove that all such potenti are finitegap thi result
is an essenti step in the picard problem though it complet and effect solut is still
an open problem
