the threshold depend and angular correl of higgsstrahlung in e e collis can be
use to demonstr the spinless natur of the standard model higg boson thi method and it
possibl extent to heavi neutral mssm higg boson is discuss
1 the next gener of collid will most like discov the higg boson or whatev other mechan is
respons for electroweak symmetri break in order to distinguish whether ani newli discov particl
is the expect higg boson or someth els not yet predict it is import to experiment determin
it properti one such task is the verif of the scalar natur of the higg boson
the isotrop decay of a higg boson is a necessari consequ of the zero spin of the higg boson but is
not suffici to confirm it spinless natur sinc other higher spin object may also exhibit isotrop decay 1
while such an observ is doubtless an interest consist check it is construct to consid other
method in thi talk i will describ the verif of the spinless natur of the standard model sm
higg boson from the threshold behaviour and angular correl of higgsstrahlung in e e collis
e e zh i then discuss the possibl extens of thi method to the heavi higg boson of the minim
supersymmetr standard model mssm
2 as a first step it is use to examin the higgsstrahlung crosssect and angular distribut for
arbitrari spin higg boson without specifi the model although a boson of nonzero spin is undoubtedli
not our tradit higg boson i shall in the interest of simplic continu to refer to it as such and will
continu to use the term higgsstrahlung for it radiat off a z boson use onli the properti of the angular
momentum oper the helic amplitud for the z zh current can be written as 2
zz hh z m
gw mz 1
z h
d
co w m z h
1
where z h and m are the helic of the real z higg and virtual z boson respect and djmm are the
usual dfunction result from the project of differ angular momentum eigenst on to one anoth
z h are reduc helic amplitud which are model depend and normal to be dimensionless if the
higg sector is cp conserv then the pariti relat between helic amplitud for a higg boson of spin j
and pariti p can be exploit
z h 1j p z h

in thi way the higgsstrahlung crosssect is given by

00 2 2 11 2 2 01 2 2 10 2 2 12 2

where ve and ae are the vector and axialvector z charg of the
electron mz is the zboson mass s the
centreofmass energi and the normal zh veloc is 2p s with p the zh threemomentum in the
centreofmass frame the standard model crosssect is recov by insert 00 ez mz 10 1
and set all other helic amplitud to zero result in an excit curv rise linearli with near the
threshold it is thi distinct properti of the sm which can be exploit to verifi the spinless natur
of the higg boson
similarli the polar angl distribut of the higg and z boson in the final state can be written

insert the sm reduc helic amplitud one see that the sm distribut of the polar angl is isotrop
near the threshold
final independ inform can be obtain by consid the finalst fermion distribut in the
decay z f f denot the fermion polar angl in the z rest frame with respect to the z flight direct in
the laboratori frame by the doubl differenti distribut in and is given by
d

note that in the sm the reduc helic amplitud 01 and 11 are zero and consequ the 1cos2 sin2
and sin2 1 cos2 correl are absent
3 of cours these formula are not use unless one ha express for the reduc helic amplitud in
a particular model to find these consid the most gener current describ the z zh vertex

gw mz
t1 j z h1 j

where is the usual spin1 polar vector and 1 j is the spinj polar tensor which is symmetr
i
the tensor t1 j is effect
traceless and orthogon to the 4momentum of the higg boson ph
transvers due to the conserv of the lepton current by choos the most gener tensor for the appropri
spin and compar with eq1 express for the reduc helic amplitud can be found
for exampl the most gener tensor for a j p 0 higg coupl to the z boson is given by
t a1 g
a2 k
q
7
where q pz ph k pz ph and denot orthogon to q project with the polar vector
and compar thi with eq1 one obtain 00 a1 ez 21 a2 s32 2 mz 10 a1 and all other reduc
helic amplitud vanish clearli the sm is restor with the choic a1 1 and a2 0
in thi way it is straightforward to write down gener reduc helic amplitud for theori with higher
spin higg boson in gener the coeffici of the tensor in t 1 j a1 and a2 in the 0 exampl abov
may be function of so the full behaviour of the cross section is still unknown howev near threshold
where is small one may make a power seri expans of these function and predict the steepest possibl
depend of the crosssect in the threshold region thi predict can be examin experiment
allow one to rule out certain spin state
a full analysi of all possibl j p state 3 reveal that everi spinpar combin yield a faster than
rise of the crosssect at threshold except for the 0 1 and 2 state in particular state of j 3
and odd pariti present at least a 3 rise of the crosssect near threshold and for j 3 the behaviour is
2j 3 and 2j 1 for 1j p 1 respect it is therefor a simpl matter to rule out the major
of j p state by simpli measur the crosssect rise at threshold 4
4 the except case must be rule out use extra observ gener the requir that the
1 or 2 state mimic the linear rise of the 0 state place restrict on the reduc helic amplitud

also
g 2 g
for a 2 higg boson the term in the z zh coupl which provid a linear rise g 1 g
contribut to all possibl reduc helic amplitud consequ all of the reduc helic amplitud
in thi model are nonzero and would provid angular correl in the decay of the z boson eq5 in
direct contradict of the sm for exampl if one then observ no 1 cos2 sin2 or no sin2 1 cos2
correl then a 2 state is rule out
the 1 state is even easier to experiment disprov firstli the observ of h decay or the
format of higg boson in photon collis h rule out all spin1 assign as a result of the
landauyang theorem in addit the spinpar relat among the reduc helic amplitud eq2
impli that 00 must vanish inde thi is also true for ani j p assign where 1j p 1 ie 2
3 4 etc therefor the observ of a sin2 sin2 correl in eq5 as predict by the standard
model elimin thi possibl final as with the 2 higg state a linear rise of the crosssect also
requir that 01 and 11 be nonzero so nonobserv of 1 cos2 sin2 or sin2 1 cos2 correl
also rule out a 1 higg boson
3
nonzero spin higg boson of nondefinit pariti ie when the z zh vertex is pariti violat are equal
straightforward to disprov in thi case one may no longer use eq2 to obtain the simpl form of the
differenti cross section seen in eqs35 in particular the polar angl distribut eq4 is modifi to
includ a linear term proport to co indic of cp violat the analysi howev proce as in the
fix normal case sinc the most gener tensor vertex will be the sum of the even and odd pariti tensor
with appropri phase factor one find that for everi spin onli one of the even or odd pariti tensor
domin at threshold so that the procedur outlin abov will also elimin all mix pariti state with
nonzero spin
also observ that thi measur can veri easili rule out an odd pariti higg boson which ha at best
a 3 rise of the crosssect at threshold it is howev unabl to distinguish between the sm 0 higg
boson and a scalar higg boson of indefinit pariti sinc their threshold behaviour will be indistinguish
5 the mssm contain two higg doublet and consequ five physic higg state two cp even h
and h one cp odd a and two charg higg boson h clearli the lightest cp even higg boson spin
can be determin via higgsstrahlung e e zh exactli as for the sm higg boson as describ abov
the heavier higg boson howev present more of a challeng here i consid onli the heavi neutral higg
boson
at first sight our method seem hopeless for determin the spin of the heavi higg boson heavi higgsstrahlung e e zh and product of the pseudoscalar in associ with the light scalar e e ah
are in thi case not use sinc their crosssect are suppress by the squar of co make them
prohibit small the onli process of use for thi method is the product of the pseudoscalar togeth
with the heavi scalar e e ah howev thi process present two major difficulti firstli we have
two unknown spin in the process assum that neither spin ha been experiment determin elsewher
give mani more differ spin combin which must be rule out secondli and more significantli in the
mssm the decay product of the spin one virtual z boson are scalar particl and consequ form a pwave
with an expect threshold depend 3 thi slowli rise signal make the threshold measur much
more difficult for experi furthermor ani higher spin combin which one would natur expect to
form an swave may mimic such a pwave by have all their nonzero helic amplitud at threshold
howev one possibl exploit featur is that sinc both h and a are scalar the mssm process ha
onli one reduc helic amplitud 00 consequ the differenti crosssect with respect to the polar
angl of the outgo pair is proport to sin2 see eq4 by contrast when one consid the possibl
tensor structur for the z ha vertex which produc similar 3 threshold crosssect depend one find
that most also contribut other nonzero reduc helic amplitud result in 1 cos2 correl in the
differenti crosssect
the except to thi rule occur when the h and a spin are ident and nonzero in order to discount
them one must again resort to the further decay into fermion pair note that thi is much more complic
than for the sm higg boson sinc we must now consid the decay of a boson whose spin is unknown in
contrast to the decay of the well studi z boson thi is beyond the scope of thi contribut and will be
report elsewher 5
6 in summari the j p quantum number for a sm higg boson can be unambigu determin by measur the threshold depend of the higgsstrahlung crosssect e e zh and the angular correl
1 cos2 sin2 and 1 cos2 sin2 the observ of a linear depend on at threshold elimin
all spinpar assign differ from 0 except 1 and 2 and these last two assign may then be
rule out by the absenc of the abov correl the method can be extend to the mssm where the
process e e zh and e e ha can be use to experiment verifi the spinless natur of all neutral
higg boson of the theori
