axiom system for quantum field theori qft grew out of hilbert sixth problem
6 that of state the problem of quantum theori in precis mathemat term
there have been sever compet mathemat system of axiom and here we
shall deal with those of as wightman 5 and of k osterwald and r schrader
4 state in histor order they are center around group symmetri rel
to unitari represent of lie group in hilbert space we also mention how the
osterwalderschrad axiom have influenc the theori of unitari represent
of group make connect with 3 wightman axiom involv 1 a unitari
represent u of g sl 2 c r4 as a cover of the poincar group of rel and a vacuum state vector 0 fix by the represent 2 quantum field
1 f n f say as operatorvalu distribut f run over a specifi
space of test function and the oper i f defin on a dens and invari
domain d in h the hilbert space of quantum state and 0 d 3 a transform law which state that u g j f u g 1 is a finitedimension represent r of the group g act on the field i f ie i rji g 1 i g f
g act on spacetim and g f x f g 1 x x r4 4 the field j f are
assum to satisfi local and one of the two canon commut relat of
a b ab ba for fermion resp boson and 5 it is assum that there
is scatter with asymptot complet in the sens h hin hout
the wightman axiom were the basi for mani of the spectacular develop
in qft in the seventi see eg 1 2 and the osterwalderschrad axiom 3 4
came in respons to the dictat of path space measur the construct approach
involv some variant of the feynman measur but the latter ha mathemat diverg that can be resolv with an analyt continu so that the mathemat welldefin wiener measur becom instead the basi for the analysi two
analyt continu were suggest
in thi connect in the massparamet
and in the timeparamet ie t 1t with the latter the newtonian quadrat form on spacetim turn into the form of rel x21 x22 x23 t2 we get
a stochast process xt symmetr ie xt xt stationari ie xt xs

sinc the kill form of lie theori may serv as a finitedimension metric the
osterwalderschrad idea 4 turn out also to have implic for the theori
of unitari represent of lie group in 3 the author associ to riemannian symmetr space gk of tube domain type a dualiti between complementari
seri represent of g on one side and highest weight represent of a
c
cdual gc on the other side the dualiti
g g involv analyt continu in a sens which gener t 1t and the reflect posit of the
osterwalderschrad axiom system what result is a new hilbert space where
the new represent of gc is physic in the sens that there is posit energi
