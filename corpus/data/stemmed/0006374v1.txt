imagin that you want to design some circuitri for a comput the logic function you have to satisfi requir a
known network of n interrel logic gate unfortun n is too larg to put all the gate on a singl integr
circuit so you have to partit the gate between separ circuit let assum that you are forc to place
exactli n2 gate each on two integr circuit the connect between gate across the partit are slow energi
consum and heat produc while the cost associ with connect insid an integr circuit are neglig
so you have to divid the network of gate such that the cost function c the number of connect cut across
the partit is minim see figur 1 becaus a million comput will be run almost nonstop for 10 year
remov even one costli connect would be worthwhil
fortun thi simplifi problem can be map onto the wellknown graph bipartit problem1 in
thi problem the n gate are the vertic of a graph with edg between two connect gate each vertex is a
boolean variabl with state 0 if place on the left integr circuit and state 1 if place on the right integr
circuit although the graph of connect is fix the vertic can chang so that we may obtain a good partit
unfortun optim the equal partit is nphard that is the comput need to find the global optimum
with certainti for even the cleverest algorithm grow faster than ani power of n2 with even the fastest comput
thi comput would be an unreason undertak for about n 100
instead we can search the space of all feasibl equal partit becaus the configur s so far are
unrel we need to defin a neighborhood n s for each s a way to proceed from the current configur
s to some neighbor configur s n s345 a simpl neighborhood for partit is a 1exchang for
each s n s consist of all s obtain by chang a 0vertex to 1 and a 1vertex to 0 to maintain an equal
partit the neighborhood n provid with a metric such that the cost function cs exhibit local extrema
like a highdimension mountain landscap then move sequenti downhil to better configur we
should reach a local minimum veri quickli howev in nphard problem the number of suboptim minima of the
n
cost function grow nearli as fast as the number of configur which here grow like n2
en thu
in thi approach there is no way to move the system from the current minimum to a better one it like find the
lowest point in a mountain landscap at night
in thi case our heurist deriv from the greek word for search mere produc approxim solut
local minima of dubiou qualiti can we do better if we had more time we could use an algorithm that make
a small random chang of the current configur if the chang is big enough it might take the system over a
mountain rang such that a subsequ descent would provid a new local minimum a sequenc of these stochast
updat can onli increas our chanc to find a better minimum5
a good stochast search while inher slow succe by control the right mixtur of descend move with
hillclimb perturb a particularli eleg stochast optim heurist is simul annealing6 to
implement simul anneal for the graph bipartit problem we can adopt the 1exchang neighborhood
by choos two vertic at random at each updat if we accept onli 1exchang that lower the cost the system
fig 1 schemat of two integr circuit with an equal number of logic gate on each the graph of connect between
gate repres by a box at each vertex of the graph is fix but gate can be move onto either integr circuit find
an equal partit of the gate such that there is a minimum of connect between the integr circuit how would you
verifi that a configur is a global optimum

converg to a like poor local minimum and no further improv is possibl for ani pair of vertic that are
chosen in contrast simul anneal allow move that rais the cost accord to the metropoli algorithm7 in
each updat a 1exchang is accept with probabl p min1 et where is the differ in cost between
the new and the old configur
control the temperatur t is crucial for simul anneal to succeed if t is too larg everi uphil move is
accept and no minima are found at all while for small t onli downhil move are accept and the system quickli
freez into a local minimum instead mimick the anneal process design to harden alloy t is lower slowli
allow simul anneal to explor the configur space landscap wide at high t to reach the largest
valley in turn thi valley may harbor a correspondingli lower minimum for the system to freez into at small
t if t is chang slowli the metropoli algorithm ensur detail balanc and thermodynam equilibrium which
mean that each move ha the same probabl as it revers becaus equilibrium system are well understood
we have an enorm amount of knowledg to guid simul anneal theoret simul anneal should
alway converg to the global optimum8 unfortun thi converg requir vanishingli small decrement of
t about as mani updat are need as in an exhaust search of short of that it is a bit of an art to devis a
temperatur schedul that balanc comput effici with the qualiti of the minima that are found4
despit it shortcom simul anneal is conceptu eleg and often highli success for practic
problem about which littl els is known it may even be use for our graph bipartit problem9 but could
we improv our procedur by throw the equilibrium requir overboard simul anneal soon collaps
for lack of ani theoret guidanc although most process in natur are outofequilibrium our understand
of these process is incomplet thu research typic bypass physic consider entir and move to a
more abstract concept of a natur process for inspir of an optim procedur thi is clearli the case
for genet algorithms10 the way that a genet code evolv and replic is poorli understood in physic term
but the basic ingredi by which such a code select optim itself is easili transcrib into an algorithm that
oper on genelik binari encod of a gener optim problem yet without the theoret guidanc that
simul anneal possess the valu of the paramet that control the work of genet algorithm mutat
rate crossov oper etc are chosen mostli by trialanderror howev with some empir knowledg
genet algorithm also prove to be a power optim procedur with mani success applications11
emerg and selforgan critic
what can we learn by focus on the physic of nonequilibrium process dure the past decad some physicist
have becom interest in system exhibit selforgan critic in which complex pattern emerg without the
need to control ani parameters12 for instanc biolog evolut ha develop appar by chanc effici
network in which resourc rare go to wast but speci are coupl in a global compar process that persist wash away the least fit in thi process unlik but highli adapt structur surfac inadvert optim
adapt thu emerg natur without divin intervent from the dynam through a select against the
extrem bad in fact thi process prevent the inflex inevit in a control breed of the good
thi coevolutionari process is the basi of the baksneppen model where the high degre of adapt of most
speci is obtain by the elimin of badli adapt one instead of the engin of better ones13 speci
in the baksneppen model are site of a lattic and each is repres by a valu between 0 and 1 indic it
fit at each updat the smallest valu repres the worst adapt speci is discard and replac with a
new valu drawn randomli from a flat distribut on 0 1 becaus the chang in fit of one speci impact the
fit of interrel speci at each updat of the baksneppen model the fit valu on the site neighbor
the smallest valu are replac with new random number as well after a certain number of updat the system
organ itself into a highli correl state characterist of selforgan criticality14 in thi state almost all
speci have reach a fit abov a certain threshold see figur 2 but chain reaction call avalanch
produc larg nonequilibrium fluctuat in the configur of fit valu the result is that ani possibl
configur is access
extrem optim
the extrem dynam of the baksneppen model can be convert into an optim algorithm that we call
extrem optimization15 attract featur of the model includ the follow
it is straightforward to relat the sum of all fit to the cost function of the system
in the selforgan critic state to which the system inevit evolv almost all speci have a much better
than random fit see figur 2
most speci preserv a good fit for long time unless they are connect to poorli adapt speci provid
the system with a long memory16
3
fig 2 snapshot dure the evolut of the baksneppen model show the fit of a 200speci system almost all
speci have develop fit abov a selforgan threshold horizont line while a small number of current activ
speci have fit below
the system retain a potenti for larg hillclimb fluctuat at ani stage
asid from pick the worst speci for an updat the model accomplish these featur without a singl
control paramet
to be precis we defin s x1 xn to be a configur of the n variabl xi in an optim
problem for instanc in the graph bipartit problem the variabl xi are the vertic which can take on the
valu 0 or 1 a configur s is one possibl arrang of n2 0s and n2 1s the cost function cs simpli
count the number of bad edg that connect a 0 with a 1 in s final we defin a neighborhood n s that map
s s n s to facilit a local search like the 1exchang for the graph bipartit problem
extrem optim perform a search through sequenti chang on a singl configur s the cost
cs is assum to consist of the individu cost contribut i for each variabl xi which correspond to the fit
valu in the baksneppen model abov typic the fit i of variabl xi depend on it state in relat to
other variabl to which xi is connect ideal it is possibl to write the cost function as
n
i
cs
1
i1
for exampl in the graph bipartit problem eq 1 is satisfi if we attribut to each vertex xi a local cost
i bi 2 where bi is the number of bad edg of xi whose cost is equal share with the vertic on the other end
of those edg
for minim problem extrem optim proce as follow
1 initi a configur s at will and set sbest s
2 for the current configur s
a evalu i for each variabl xi
b find j with j i for all i that is xj ha the worst fit
c choos a random s n s such that xj must chang
d if cs csbest store sbest s
e accept s s alway independ of cs cs
3 repeat at step 2 as long as desir
4 return sbest and csbest
a typic run of thi implement of extrem optim for the graph bipartit problem on an n 500
random graph is shown in figur 3a
the most appar distinct between extrem optim and other method is the need to defin local cost
contribut for each variabl instead of mere a global cost extrem optim capabl appear to deriv
from it abil to access thi local inform directli extrem optim rank of fit requir for
step 2b abov superfici appear like the rank of possibl move in some version of simul anneal and

fig 4 comparison of 1000run trial use variou optim method on g500 9 the histogram give the frequenc with
which a particular cost ha been obtain dure the trial run for a simul anneal b basic extrem optim
and c for extrem optim with 15 the best cost ever found for thi graph is 206 thi result appear onli
onc over the 1000 simul anneal run but 80 time for extrem optim
other heuristics4 there move are evalu by their anticip outcom while extrem optim fit
reflect the current configur s without bias the outcom as a comparison of figur 3a and 3b demonstr
a sequenc of these move allow for much larger than equilibrium fluctuat in cs
although similarli motiv genet algorithms1011 and extrem optim algorithm have hardli anyth
in common genet algorithm mimic evolut on the level of gene and keep track of entir gene pool of configur from which to select and breed an improv gener of solut in comparison extrem optim
base on evolutionari competit at the phenomenolog level of speci oper onli on a singl configur
with improv achiev mere by the elimin of bad fit valu extrem optim and simul
anneal perform a local search but in genet algorithm crossov oper perform global exchang
simpl extrem optim applic to graph partit
follow the exampl of ref 9 see figur 9 we test earli implement of extrem optimization17 on their
n 500 random graph g500 thi version is base on a 1exchang between the worst vertex step 2b and one
randomli chosen vertex of the opposit state step 2c in a 1000run sampl from differ random initi condit
we determin the frequenc of solut see figur 4 for comparison we have also implement the simul
anneal algorithm as given in ref 9 on the same data structur use by our extrem optim program we
have use run time for extrem optim that are about three time longer than the time it took for simul
anneal to freez becaus extrem optim still yield signific gain we check that neither the bestofthre run of simul anneal or a three time longer temperatur schedul improv the simul anneal
result significantli although the basic parameterfre version of extrem optim consid so far is alreadi
competit the best result are obtain by extrem optim which we now discuss
the extrem optim implement
the extrem optim implement is a modif of extrem optim that improv result and
avoid dead end that occur in some implement at the expens of introduc a singl parameter17 in gener
the implement of extrem optim proce as follow rank all the variabl xi accord to their fit

i that is find a permut of the label i such that
1 2 n
2
the worst variabl xj see step 2b is of rank 1 j 1 and the best variabl is of rank n consid a probabl
distribut over the rank k

for a fix valu of the paramet at each updat for each independ variabl x to be move select distinct
rank k1 k2 accord to pk then execut step 2c such that all xi1 xi2 with i1 k1 i2 k2
chang for exampl in the bipartit problem we choos both variabl in the 1exchang accord to pk
instead of the worst and a random one although the worst variabl of rank i 1 will be chosen most often sometim
much higher rank will be updat instead in fact the choic of a powerlaw distribut for pk instead of say
an exponenti distribut with a cutoff scale exclud high rank ensur that no rank get exclud from further
evolut while maintain a bia against variabl with bad fit
clearli for 0 extrem optim is exactli a random walk through convers for the process
approach a determinist local search onli swap the lowestrank variabl and is bound to reach a dead end
inde test of both 0 and yield terribl result in the graph bipartit problem we obtain our
best solut for in the rang 1416 clearli we have tune away from the philosophi of the baksneppen
model by insert a singl paramet for the sake of better result to be success everi heurist ha to allow for
some adjust to a particular problem
tabl i summar our extrem optim result on some wellstudi instanc of graph with larg n
use 14 and bestof10 run we obtain initi configur from a simpl cluster algorithm17 then
we choos the number of updat t to obtain reliabl result that do not chang much with t the choic of t vari
with the particular of each graph from t 2n to t 200n and the report run time are of cours influenc
by the valu of t it is worth note though that extrem optim averag perform ha been vari for
instanc half of the run on the graph known as brack2 return cost near 731 but the other half return cost
abov 2000 thi may be a product of an unusu structur in thi particular graph a systemat studi of extrem
optim in comparison with simul anneal by averag over mani graph of increas size is given in
ref 21
other extrem optim implement
to demonstr the gener of extrem optim we are current studi it implement for other nphard optim problem such as graph color kcol satisfi ksat and spin glass hamiltonian
in kcol given k differ color to label the vertic of a graph we need to find a color that minim the
number of edg connect vertic of ident color22 a definit of fit is as obviou as it wa for the graph
bipartit problem for each vertex xi simpli count the number bi of equal color vertic connect to it
set i bi 2 again satisfi eq 1 the lack of a global constraint as for the graph bipartit problem allow
us to defin a neighborhood by chang the state of onli one the worst variabl howev thi definit result
in a determinist search that quickli reach a dead end but a extrem optim implement pick a
singl variabl with 27 seem to work best for the graph we have studi
with thi algorithm we have studi the phase transit of kcol23 where the realli hard instanc are24
thi transit aris as a function of the averag vertex degre for certain type of graph the degre of a
vertex is the number of edg eman from it and may vari between vertic of a graph if is small almost all
tabl i best cost and allow run time in second for a testb of larg graph the valu of n is given for each graph
genet algorithm result are the best reported18 use a 300 mhz cpu the extrem optim result are from our
run 200 mhz comparison data for three of the larg graph are due to result from heurist in ref 19 50 mhz meti
is a partit program base on hierarch reduct instead of local search20 and yield extrem fast determinist

where the cost function intersect of crit 3 473 is indic by a vertic line
vertic have fewer than k neighbor color becom trivial and the optim solut ha zero cost for almost all
graph instanc but around a critic valu crit k the cost becom posit with an ever sharper transit for
n if we averag the best solut that extrem optim find over mani instanc of random graphs25
we can show for exampl that crit 3 473 see figur 5 the relationship between phase transit which
occur in mani nphard problem and comput complex is evolv into one of the hot topic in comput
science24 26272328 in thi interest regim extrem optim larg fluctuat appear to have the
edg over simul anneal equilibrium requirements21
becaus extrem optim is fairli new there are mani question yet to be answer it will not be difficult
for the interest reader to think of research project that for exampl compar extrem optim to other
method clearli like ani other optim method extrem optim will not be competit for some
problem unfortun the travel salesman problem seem to be one example17 but it cant hurt to have more
altern method to choos from for tackl hard optim problem
