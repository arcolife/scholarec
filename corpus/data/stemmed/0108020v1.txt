abstract ani leafwis connect on a fibr bundl over a foliat manifold is prove to come
from a connect on thi fibr bundl
mathemat subject classif 2000 53c05 53c12
let z f be a foliat manifold where f denot a regular foliat of z let
y z be a fibr bundl over z a leafwis connect on y z is defin as a partial
connect along the leav of a folit f obvious each connect on y z yield
a leafwis connect we show that ani leafwis connect on y z is of thi type
thi fact is import eg for geometr quantiz of symplect foliat
we start from the notion of a leafwis differenti calculu on a foliat manifold all
manifold throughout are smooth real finitedimension hausdorff paracompact and
connect
if z f is a regular foliat manifold there is an adapt coordin atla
f u z z a

of z such that for everi leaf f of a foliat f the connect compon of f u
are describ by the equat z a const and transit function of coordin z a are
independ of the remain one 3
the tangent space to leav of a foliat f assembl into an involut distribut
t f z on z call the tangent bundl to f it global section constitut the real lie
algebra t f z of vector field on z subordin to t f thi lie algebra is a left c zsubmodul of the deriv modul of the rring c z of smooth real function on z
let sf z be the kernel of t f z act on c z it consist of function constant
on leav of f ie foliat function in the terminolog of 4 then t f z is the
lie sf zalgebra of deriv of c z seen as a sf zring let us consid the
chevalleyeilenberg differenti calculu over the sf zring c z it is defin as a
cochain subcomplex

t f z of t f z they are call the leafwis form on a foliat manifold z f
one should distinguish them from foliat form in 4 which are exterior form on z
constant on leav of a foliat with respect to the adapt coordin z z a 1
the leafwis form read

turn now to the notion of a leafwis connect on a fibr bundl

over a foliat manifold z f the invers imag 1 f of leav f of the foliat f

atla u z z a 1 of a foliat manifold z f such that u are trivial domain
of a fibr bundl y z let z z a y i be the correspond bundl coordin on
y z they are also adapt coordin on the foliat manifold y yf
let us note that in the terminolog of 4 a fibr bundl y z 7 is call foliat
if it transit function are constant along leav of f
given the tangent bundl t yf y to the foliat yf of y we have the exact

one can think of jf1 y as be a leafwis jet manifold of a fibr bundl y z with

in particular everi section s of a fibr bundl y z give rise to the section

of the leafwis jet bundl jf1 y z
similalri to the case of a connect one can show that everi leafwis connect on
a fibr bundl y z is a global section of the affin leafwis jet bundl

and vice versa it follow that leafwis connect constitut an affin space model on
