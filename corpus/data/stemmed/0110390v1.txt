we review the role of a muon collid in the studi of higg boson via product in the schannel veri precis measur of a standard modellik higg boson mass and total width
can be perform and may lead to a discrimin between a standard model higg boson and
the light higg boson of the minim supersymmetr theori the heavier higg boson from a
supersymmetr theori or an exot higg sector can be studi in the schannel a muon collid
may play a crucial role in separ the overlap signal for two heavi nearli degener higg
boson and may play an import role in precis test of radi correct in the higg
sector the measur at a muon collid will be complementari to the higg studi at the
larg hadron collid and at an electronpositron linear collid

introduct
interest ha grown rapidli in muon collid in the last sever year as it becam clear that the technolog
challeng might not be insurmountable2 muon collid are of interest to particl physic explor for a
number of reason a the absenc of signific bremsstrahlung allow one to contempl circular acceler
of much higher energi than is possibl with e e machin b the coupl of higg boson is proport to
particl mass see fig 1 and henc there is the possibl that higg boson can be produc in reason
number in the schannel3 4 c there are region of paramet space for which it will be imposs for
either the larg hadron collid lhc or a linear collid lc to discov the heavier higg boson of
supersymmetri or in the case of a gener twohiggsdoublet or more extend model higg boson of ani
mass with small or zero v v coupl d the neutrino from the decay of muon can be use as a sourc for a
neutrino factory5 6
the larg mass of the muon in comparison to that of the electron result in a number of advantag featur
of a muon collid the beam energi spread of a muon collid can be veri small make them use for
studi narrow reson like the sm higg boson in addit there is littl bremsstrahlung and the beam
energi can be tune to one part in a million through in situ spinrot measurements7
high rate of higg product at e e collid reli on substanti v v higg coupl for the higgsstrahlung
process zhigg or for the w w fusion process w w higg w w fusion in contrast a collid can
provid a factori for produc a higg boson with littl or no v v coupl so long as it ha smlike or
enhanc coupl import exampl of thi last form of higg boson are the heavi neutral higg
boson h 0 and a0 of the minim supersymmetr standard model mssm
if the a light
130 gev higg boson exist then both e e and collid will be valuabl the higg
boson would have been discov at a previou higher energi collid possibl a muon collid run at high
energi and then the higg factori would be built with a centerofmass energi precis tune to the higg
boson mass the most like scenario is that the higg boson is discov at the lhc via gluon fusion gg h
or perhap earlier at the tevatron via associ product q q w h tth and it mass is determin to
an accuraci of about 100 mev if a linear collid ha also observ the higg via the higgsstrahlung process
e e zh one might know the higg boson mass to better
than 50 mev with an integr luminos of
500 fb1 the muon collid would be optim to run at s mh and thi centerofmass energi would be
vari over a narrow rang so as to scan over the higg reson
submit to the proceed of the futur of particl physic snowmass 2001 p1 group an expand version of the
physic of higg factori ha been submit to the e1 group1

the need for r valu as small as 0003 for studi a light smlike h in addit to the veri small beam

a narrow reson thi can be accomplish util the spin precess of the muon note abov a sampl
scan is illustr in fig 2 for a mhsm 110 gev sm higg boson
the sm higg cross section and background as well as the integr luminos requir for a 5 signal are
shown in fig 3 for r 0003 and mhsm valu such that the domin decay mode is bb the signific

the higg boson in supersymmetr model are in gener detect at muon collid if the mass of
the supersymmetr particl are larg the higg sector typic exhibit decoupl behavior in which the
lightest supersymmetr higg boson h0 will be veri similar to the hsm when the other higg boson are heavi
and the h0 rate will be veri similar to hsm rate on the other hand the heavier higg boson in a typic
supersymmetr model decoupl from pair of gaug boson v v at larg mass and remain reason narrow

1 gev unless the tt decay mode is open as a result their schannel product rate remain larg and a
muon collid can avoid the product channel that depend on a sizabl coupl to gaug boson
what can a muon collid add to the lhc and lc the lhc and quit like a linear collid will be avail
alreadi and the higg boson will be detect and some of it properti determin befor a muon collid
will becom oper current expect for the luminos at an lc are 500 fb1 over 12 year thi
yield a sm higg boson product rate of greater than 104 per year in the process e e zh therefor
the latest estim of the luminos at a linear collid yield number of higg boson that are compar to
what will be avail at a muon colliderhigg factori with it more modest integr luminos expect
with the current machin paramet of the order of one invers femtobarn a linear collid with such high
luminos can certainli perform quit accur measur of certain higg paramet such as the higg
mass coupl to gaug boson coupl to heavi quark etc8
the schannel product process allow one to determin the mass total width and the cross section
h h x for sever final state x to veri high precis the higg mass total width and the
cross section can be use to constrain the paramet of the higg sector for exampl in the mssm their
precis valu will constrain the higg sector paramet ma0 and tan where tan is the ratio of the two
vacuum expect valu vev of the two higg doublet of the mssm the main question is whether these
constraint will be a valuabl addit to lhc and lc constraint
precis measur of the coupl of the higg boson to the standard model particl are import test
of the mass gener mechan in the standard model with one higg doublet thi coupl is proport
to the particl mass in the more gener case there can be mix angl present in the coupl precis
measur of the coupl can distinguish the standard model higg boson from the smlike higg boson
typic present in a more gener model if deviat are found their magnitud can be extrem crucial for
constrain the paramet of the more gener higg sector in particular it might be possibl to estim
the mass of the other higg boson of the extend higg sector therebi allow a more focus search for
them
the precis possibl at a muon collid for measur mh and tot
h of a smlike h with mh 110 gev
are 1 3 106 and 02 respect to achiev these accuraci one first determin the higg mass to
about 1 mev by the preliminari scan illustr in fig 2 then a dedic threepoint fine scan3 near the

a 5 standard deviat detect in bb from ref 3 for a smlike h at s mh 115 gev the bb final state rate
are 104 event lf b1 for both the signal and the background
reson peak use l 02 fb1 of integr luminos correspond to a few year of oper would
be perform for a sm higg boson with a mass suffici below the w w threshold the higg total width
is veri small of order sever mev and the onli process where it can be measur directli is in the schannel
at a muon collid an accur measur of tot
h would be a veri valuabl input for precis test of the
higg sector in particular sinc all the coupl of the standard model hsm are known tot
hsm is precis
predict therefor the precis determin of tot
obtain
by
thi
scan
would
be
an
import
test of the
h
standard model and ani deviat would be evid for a nonstandard higg sector or other new physic
other interest measur of higg boson properti can be perform at a muon collid in the case
where at least a hundr invers femtobarn of luminos is avail then the mass width and spin of a
smlike higg boson can also be determin by oper either a muon collid or a linear collid at the zh
product threshold where the rate is sensit to the higg mass9 with 100 fb1 of integr luminos
an error of less than 100 mev can be achieved9 for mh 150 gev the shape of the zh threshold
cross section can also be use to determin the spin and to check the cp natur of the higgs10

heavi higg boson
in supersymmetr model there are multipl physic higg boson often the higg spectrum includ a
smlike higg boson with mass close to the z boson mass and some heavier higg boson whose coupl are
veri much differ than a sm particl of the same mass for exampl in the mssm there is a light neutral h0
and two heavier neutral higg boson h 0 and a0 as one adjust the paramet of the theori to make the h 0
and a0 heavier the light higg boson h0 becom more and more like the sm higg boson it may veri well be
the case that after the initi discoveri of thi smlike higg boson the primari question will involv detect
deviat from the sm higg sector by a measur veri precis the smlike higg boson properti andor
b directli discov addit higg boson
in the context of the mssm it is highli like that the process e e zh use to find and studi the light
higg state at a first gener lc will not be suitabl for the heavier higg boson becaus in the decoupl
5
fig 4 separ of a and h signal for tan 5 and 10 from ref 3
limit the coupl of the higg to gaug boson is greatli suppress thi is a corollari to the statement that
the light higg boson in standard modellik there is a 250 500
gev rang of heavi higg boson mass
for which discoveri is not possibl via h 0 a0 pair product at a s 500 gev lc further the a0 and h 0
cannot be detect in thi mass rang at either the lhc or lc for a wedg of moder tan valu for larg
enough valu of tan the heavi higg boson are expect to be observ in bba0 bbh 0 product at the
lhc via their decay and also at the lc a linear collid oper in the mode can produc higg
boson in the schannel and there have been a number of studi of such processes11 12 13 14 15 16 17
thi requir that such an option exist and the energi of the system is not as sharpli peak at the
centerofmass energi as it is for the muon collid
a muon collid can fill some perhap all of thi moder tan wedg if tan is larg the h 0 and
0
a coupl proport to tan time a smlike valu are enhanc therebi lead to enhanc
product rate in collis these boson can be discov via the radi return mechanism3
and onc a peak is found the machin energi can be set to ma0 or mh 0 and the muon collid becom a higg
factori for the heavier higg boson the resolut requir for studi the heavi higg boson in the
schannel are not as stringent as those for the light higg boson becaus the heavier higg boson width are
gener much larger sinc r 01 is suffici much higher luminos l 2 10 fb1 yr would be
possibl as compar to that for r 001 0003 as requir for studi the h0
in the mssm the heavi higg boson are larg degener especi in the decoupl limit where they
are heavi in that case a muon collid with suffici energi resolut might be the onli possibl mean for
separ out these state exampl show the h 0 and a0 reson for tan 5 and 10 are shown in
fig 4 for the larger valu of tan the reson are clearli overlap for the better energi resolut
of r 001 the two distinct reson peak are still visibl but they are smear out and merg into one
broad peak for r 006
muon collid excel at make precis measur of higg boson mass sinc they can exploit the schannel product process thi is reminisc of the veri accur determin of the z boson mass to just
22 mev from the lep measurements18 precis measur of supersymmetr higg boson mass could
provid a power window on radi corrections19 supersymmetri togeth with gaug invari in the
mssm impli the masssquar sum rule

where is a calcul radi correct the treelevel sum rule result from set 0 thi formula
involv observ mass that can be precis measur in the schannel process solv for the mass
differ
m a0 m h 0
m2h0 m2z
m a0 m h 0

and one obtain a form that indic in the decoupl limit ma0 the mass differ between the
heavi higg boson becom small as discuss in the previou section the light higg mass mh0 can be
measur to less than an mev in the schannel the mass of and the mass differ between the heavi
higg state h 0 and a0 can also be measur precis by schannel product the ultim precis that
can be obtain on the mass of the h 0 and a0 depend strongli on the mass themselv and tan but
a reason expect is that a scan through the reson should be abl to determin the mass and
the massdiffer to some ten of mev with just 01 fb1 of integr luminosity19 altogeth these mass
measur yield a valu for the radi correct to a precis of order 10 gev2 sinc the typic
size of is of order 104 gev2 thi constitut a measur of roughli one part in 103 the quantiti is
calcul in term of the selfenergi diagram of the higg bosons20 and a comparison between the measur
valu and the theoret predict yield a test of radi correct in the mssm further progress in
the theoret calcul of would be need to fulli exploit the expect precis of the experiment

conclud remark
recent experiment result hint that a muon collid may play a crucial role in studi the next gener
of physic signal there is the evid from lep21 22 23 24 25 for a higg boson near mh 115 gev
thi
2 signal is not definit but it ha been taken veri serious sinc it is consist with the current
precis electroweak data and fit well with a supersymmetr interpret a higg boson with such a mass
is in the optim rang for studi at a higg factori such a higg boson sit comfort abov the zpole where
there is a larg background from z decay to bb and a 115 gev mass is suffici below the w w threshold
that the decay width remain small and the abil of the muon collid to achiev a veri narrow beam energi
spread can be exploit
in the mssm such a higg boson mass of 115 gev is near the theoret upper limit of mh 0 130 gev
and would indic a valu of the supersymmetri paramet tan substanti abov 1 assum stop mass
1 tev thi is consist with recent evid for nonsm contribut to the anomal magnet moment
of the muon26 which also can be explain in the mssm with a moder larg valu of tan if these earli
indic prevail and we are left with a supersymmetr higg sector with larg tan then it is like that the
heavi higg h 0 and a0 will not be observ at the lhc or a lc the detect of these higg boson could
be accomplish in the schannel at a muon collid and some precis test involv the higg boson mass
can be perform to check radi correct in the higg sector more gener the muon collid ha the
potenti to find and studi higg boson that exist in more gener model than the mssm with extend higg
sector in thi more gener context the muon collid offer the possibl of studi the cp natur of the
higg boson that are found
final the muon collid program encompass much more than physic of higg factori describ here
interest physic can be envis at all stage of the develop of muon collid from neutrino factori
to higg factori to even higher energi
