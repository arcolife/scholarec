sound movi or other inform materi they therebi confront student as well as
teacher with a new paradigm of knowledg transfer network multimedia accessori not
onli transport a formerli unknown multitud of present method to the lectur hall or in
the framework of teleteach to student home but they also present an unfilt total of
present knowledg with which in term of quantiti and rapid of chang no singl teacher
can compet
howev individu aspect of classroom commun remain bound to tradit lectur
form these are first of all direct dialogu and relat interchang secondli and almost
equal import is the notion of time and speed that teacher impos on hi student by
determin the order and pace in which the materi is roll out and final by fix the
date for test and for document success it is thi time control process that ultim
determin perform
mani attempt are made to use world wide web techniqu to at least partial substitut
tradit lectur the intent of thi is to liber student from the restrict of
tempor and spatial presenc and therebi offer knowledg to a wider public but in contrast
thi work wa support in part by the efr program of the european commiss
to a person classroom attend an httpbase train modul is driven by end user
mous click and thu deleg the order and time complet to the recipi of the
learn materi therefor it place on the learner the respons not onli for overal
understand but also for undertak each progress step in time
the import concept of time in teach is one major reason for all the attent in recent
research work to world wide web techniqu that distribut multimedia document with
tempor and spatial relat the grow demand for synchronis handl of timebas
media such as video and audio serv as a second motiv for introduc tempor aspect to
the web final stream data sourc creat a new level of scalabl by account for
transport time and therefor becom import quantit throughout the internet
in the present paper we present the project media object in time mobit that develop a
model for timedirect present and process of univers media object as well as a
prototyp for a mobit runtim environ the open system oper on standard format
for multimedia inform content structur relat between document are specif to the
model but may be easili extract from the underli xml type definit
thi paper is organis as follow in section 2 we introduc the basic idea and function
of our project and draw comparison to relat work section 3 present the underli
compound flow model cfm architectur and implement properti of the mobit
runtim environ will be discuss in section 4 final section 5 is dedic to
conclus and an outlook on the ongo work
the teach and present system introduc here centr around the idea of media
object that can be synchronis in time and that can be link to form fairli complex
present but at the same time ani object remain selfconsist and can be use
independ roughli speak our basic concept consist of defin media object
instanc and line them up in time as is shown in figur 1 mobit intend to provid an
accur scheme for tempor and spatial placement of present object where author do
not have to take care of interobject synchronis depend or adapt to possibl
inaccur network perform the latter be subject to implement of latenc hide
techniqu
present itself on a timelin
each present becom a
timebas data object even if
compos onli of timeless
media such as text or imag
ani present compon
will carri an instanc of initi
appear and a moment
possibl at infinitum for
fade away from the client
screen within thi framework
ani stream media such as
video or audio may be includ
and synchronis to the scene and the overal data stream
aim at combin utilis in lectur room as well as in teleteach our model focus
on a clear straightforward concept of reusabl compound media compon screenplay
script arrang their behaviour in space and time will accompani these thu instead of the
pageori www concept or the typic eventdriven natur of cbt product mobit
run as a flowori present model show for exampl a crashtest video combin
subsequ with chart of relev statist and vocal explain cad car model
the implement of the mobit runtim prototyp concentr on a pure java solut
ani recipi may load the correspond java applet into the browser which will then
connect to the mobit server request for metadata open media data stream and eventu
start the timer and the display process spatial and tempor placement is done with great
accuraci addit plugin softwar is not requir
as mention earlier sever interest research activ present impos the concept of
time to the web the most promin be the w3c recommend synchron
multimedia integr languag smil 4 as a declar languag smil allow for
synchronis of media object in a somewhat simplist htmlstyle fashion
synchronis is done in object pair either sequenti or in parallel the appear of
ani object may be bound to a durat paramet smil extend the notion of hyperlink to
connect tempor and spatial sub region
the runtim behaviour of a smil interpret is therebi left more or less open which is
probabl the most import drawback of the model combin with the absenc of a
stringent handl of timelin tempor inconsist in more complex document can be
foreseen besid few refer implement of smil player there is an attempt to
includ synchronis featur into the web browser call htmltime 5 thi
propos address tempor extens to html and incorpor basic element of smil
howev both idea suffer substanti limit due to the simplist design of html
which ha no structur for media object use rutledg et al 7 consequ report about
sever difficulti in author smil present mainli due to the lack of reusabl of
object composit as well as to smil inabl to deal with complex object relat in
the most recent work the boston specif of smil 6 the world wide web consortium
head for a realis of smil as a modul within the framework of the xhtml languag
most of thi work is present ongo and far too incomplet to allow implement
as a complet differ exampl more similar to our work we would like to mention the
nest context model ncm of soar et al 8 with the aim of establish a strong
structur for flexibl deploy of hypermedia document the ncm provid composit
meta structur for differ media type call node up to an arbitrari level of
complex these node may contain a refer list of denot node give rise to an
arbitrari graph structur of the compos document the model which ha been implement
in a system call hyperprop treat hypermedia document essenti as passiv data
structur synchronis are defin through event which may occur as the result of
object present or user interact
sinc embed of media object within the ncm result in a passiv mesh without further
present mean an addit structur of activ event and context call
perspect ha to be superimpos thi characterist on the one hand leav some
freedom to the author the same object structur may encount differ behaviour in
differ context on the other hand it add an addit level of complex to the model
hypermedia system which repres the major differ from our work
in design the compound flow model cfm much care wa taken to defin a simpl
structur of straightforward logic which intuit appeal to document author and is suit
for lightweight implement especi on the client side the cfm centr on a uniform
hull entiti call media object mob serv as a univers contain for embed either
subsequ mob or media data by referenc one anoth mob allow for hierarch
composit of unlimit depth where the leav of the result tree structur are fed with
the actual media inform by mean of a distinct data object call element s figur 2

vital to the framework of cfm is an environ for gener and control the flow as
media object for a given present may be wide branch each one of them equip
with a complex structur inherit and it own synchronis demand a flow control
modul need to resolv all structur data depend it thereaft ha to linearis result
bulk inform to form an order flow and final add object to the extern provid
primari timer
media object may be seen as the central constitu make up the cfm data structur as
the basic design idea a mob consist of both the subordin object refer list and a
screenplay script for the refer describ all paramet respons for their behaviour
in time and space these script we denot as playlist playlist describ the total state
attain by the correspond mob
the notion of gener reusabl of ani of the compon involv is tightli bound to
the concept of combin refer to object and their state roughli speak an object
exhibit generalis reusabl if and onli if it is selfconsist and parameteris in state
space the fundament paramet of the state space up to now are the spatial size and the
durat in time some addit featur such as background colour or chang of font type
have been implement howev the definit of sustain paramet is still somewhat
vagu the actual realiz of paramet valu need to be done at the level of individu
element eg scale clip nevertheless ani mob is equip with the abil to
receiv and process avail paramet
selfconsist of mob hierarchi may be view either from a structur or a state space
perspect structur selfconsist is present as long as the object refer hierarchi
omit recurs ie a mob must not contain ani referr point to itself or a subordin
object selfconsist in state space is ensur as long as ani mob stay within the tempor
and spatial bound of it supermob
to strengthen thi twofold notion our mob design includ the congruenc of consist in
structur and state space as an integr part of the cf model structur arrang of
mob carri the notion of inclus relat in space and time as one result scale paramet
are process along the object hierarchi to hand down actual element size the exact
appear of a media object thu not onli depend on it individu referenc paramet
but also on it rel posit within the hierarchi as one benefit it should be note that an
author can place and parameteris ani compound object in ani context and the system will
ensur spatial and tempor integr
as is clear from the abov everi mob provid it own rel coordin system in space
and time each of them need transform into display coordin dure runtim
refer identifi of object reli on a scheme of global databas number and need to be
transfer into local present coordin as use in 3 most importantli mob are
structur in a possibl complex highli nonlinear fashion that may be suitabl for spatial
represent but is inappropri for display conform to linear time
even though compon of the model are of an activ selfconsist natur an addit
flow gener need to be present gener a flow in our context ha to fulfil the task of
resolv all open object depend collect the data and en passant perform coordin transform and at the core linearis data with respect to time as a result of
such linear align all playlist are merg to form a complet script for the screenplay of
the whole present the flow gener as describ is if properli implement well
suit for transmit data collect of present as a sequenti stream over the
network
the technic core of the mobit runtim environ is form by an open multimedia
architectur design accord to a 3tier principl as is shown in figur 4 a java applet
on the client side take care of the
present process the data object
deliveri and includ the flow gener by
mean of a sequentialis data interfac and
a time state machin media specif aspect
are found encapsul within element
class that control format process and
display independ the element class
request implement of method
accord to the system action type and
can henc easili be extend the client
also provid the gener option to receiv
and compos addit sub server class
and eventu run them in a separ thread
the mobit server is likewis written in
java and is primarili respons for the
session and transact manag with
respect to client applet client and server
commun via a simpl data exchang
protocol that is spoken asynchron
through buffer cach layer allow for
latenc hide to retriev media data from
a repositori the server reli on an abstract
data interfac present fed by the two data
sourc implement media object
structur may be xmlcode for direct
server process to store data onli in a flat
file system more elabor data access is
offer by an intellig multifunct
multimedia databas system which will be
describ in a forthcom paper 9 both meta data and binari element are readili hand
over as java object instanc at the mobit applic server demand
the abil to deal with pluggabl sub server may be seen as an import featur of thi
platform sub serv not onli open up the field for nonstandard media and stream but
also allow for incorpor of new complex function such as onlin data process
without fatten the thin applet client for an overal streamori system it appear quit
natur to includ serv media for stream mobil provid a flexibl and simpl interfac
for thi purpos current are use to incorpor the high perform optimis java
wavelet video player sub
server of cycon et al 2
a direct text sender that
permit messag to
ongo present and
a latex server that
process latex formula
for display
the interfac to includ
ani type of sub server ha
been purpos design
in a simpl way ani sub
server must implement the
procedur
getportcount
to
allow for inquiri on
request number of port
setport to permit
port assign and
setdata to receiv data
handl
and
the
initialis addit
inform class etc
are kept option the
interfac
at
the
correspond client site
appear even simpler
setserverinfo and
getserverinfo
are
the procedur need
here within thi open framework it should be easi to bring addit data server to the
system for instanc to includ realtim visual or live stream etc
the system offer easi access for author through a web author tool it is design to
guid author through the differ level of complex by mean of sever adapt view
becaus it is well known and to some extent obviou that the wysiwyg paradigm doe not
hold in the case of tempor structur or event edit 14 we attempt to relat the multipl
aspect of author to specif intuit appear of the tool therebi reli on the
semant of the structur relat of the system
at the first stage of content author our tool allow for data object upload and control
guid by an object browser the author may organis and retriev object in a directori
structur of a virtual file
system assign name
media
type
and
properti to the dob
and upload actual data to
the data store s fig 6
in gener media data
manipul is not
meant to be part of the
applic
author
process but for the sake
of simplic a simpl
text editor that also
support
htmlformat is includ in
the system and permit
the direct gener of
written text
wherea the object
browser in the mob
edit regim remain
unchang dedic support is given to the author in design present with the help
of a structur view a spatial view and an rel object timelin author of mobbas
applic receiv it basic tool howev as wa point out abov the specif semant
of media object structur is onli fix with the applic layout thu the author
requir may chang significantli between differ field of use and in gener specif
aspect cannot be foreseen by includ a toolbox of method our open system provid a
program interfac to allow for easi applicationdepend extens in the form of
specif view
the lack of tempor aspect within today attempt at internet present and train ha
been recogn as a seriou deficit there are sever interest activ to overcom thi
in the context of thi debat our paper present the timeori teach and present
system mobit that ha been design to handl complex reusabl media object in time we
introduc a clear straightforward concept that cope with tempor and spatial object
hierarchi base on the cfm streamori model the prototyp implement
describ here is still heavili under construct and it will be made publicli avail at a
more matur stage
howev much work still ha to be done in thi ongo project interact have not yet
been defin in cfm as simpl smiltyp hyperlink in our flowori model could onli
support hop between possibl nest parallel timelin and as we do not intend to
produc an interact program languag our current activ concentr on model
an interact paradigm take into account the cfm potenti to oper on selfconsist
media object we are aim at a small alphabet of oper which enabl author to
open up an unlimit number of navig path to the receptor with onli a limit number
of defin interact
interact will introduc an addit complex to the treatment of network behaviour as
they might contradict latenc hide techniqu thi is unavoid true for user dialogu
element for the load of larg binari element a care time control will be need
howev the buffer preread of mob may be view as fill an instruct cach of a
process unit interact impos branch to the instruct flow and can be buffer in
parallel so that immedi system respons is gener
we would like to thank han cycon and hi group for the pleasant collabor they
develop the highli optimis wavelet video algorithm and the codec mark palkow
care port the codec to java torsten rack wa respons for the author tool
