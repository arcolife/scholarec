introduct
massiv starform region have tradit been prime target for astrochemistri owe to their bright molecular line eg johansson et al 1984
cummin et al 1986 irvin et al 1987 ohishi 1997 massiv young stellar
object yso have luminos of 104 106 l and involv young o and
btype star becaus their format proce more rapidli than that of lowmass star and involv ioniz radiat substanti chemic differ may
be expect the format of high mass star is much less well understood
than that of lowmass star for exampl observ phenomena such as
ultracompact h ii region hot core maser and outflow have not yet been
link into a singl evolutionari pictur chemistri may well be an import
diagnost tool in establish such a sequenc
most of the earli work on massiv starform region ha center on two
sourc orionkl and sgrb2 numer line survey at millimet eg blake
et al 1987 turner 1991 and submillimet jewel et al 1989 sutton et al
1991 1995 schilk et al 1997 wavelength have led to an extens inventori
of molecul through identif of thousand of line in addit the survey
have shown strong chemic variat between differ sourc
in recent year new observ tool have allow a more detail and
systemat studi of the envelop of massiv yso submillimet observ

densiti 106 vs 104 cm3 than the earlier work moreov interferomet
at 3 and 1 millimet provid map with resolut of 05 5 final groundand spacebas infrar observ allow both the ga and the ice to be
sampl eg evan et al 1991 van dishoeck et al 1999 these observ
develop have led to a reviv of the studi of massiv star format within
the last few year recent overview of the physic aspect of highmass star
format are found in churchwel 1999 and garay lizano 1999
in thi brief review we will first summar avail observ diagnost to studi the differ phase and physic compon associ with
massiv star format subsequ an overview of recent result on intermedi mass yso is given which are often better character than their
highmass counterpart becaus of their closer distanc subsequ we will
discuss a specif sampl of embed massiv yso which have been studi
through a combin of infrar and submillimet data after illustr the
model techniqu we address the question how the observ chemic variat are relat to evolutionari effect differ condit in the envelop
eg t mass or differ luminos of the yso more extens overview
of the chemic evolut of starform region are given by van dishoeck

submillimet and infrar diagnost
the major of molecul are detect at submillimet wavelength and
line survey highlight the larg variat in chemic composit between differ yso both within the same parent molecular cloud and between differ
cloud the recent 13 mm survey of sgr b2 nummelin et al 1998 ohishi
kaifu 1999 dramat illustr the strong variat between variou posit see figur 1 the north posit is typic of hot coretyp spectra
which are rich in line of satur organ molecul thi posit ha also
been name the larg molecul heimat eg kuan snyder 1994 liu snyder
1999 the middl posit ha strong so and so2 line wherea the northwest posit ha a lesscrowd spectrum with line of ion and long carbon
chain a similar differenti ha been observ for three posit in the
w 3 giant molecular cloud by helmich van dishoeck 1997 who suggest
an evolutionari sequenc base on the chemistri
the avail of complet infrar spectra from 24200 m with the
infrar space observatori iso allow complementari variat in infrar
featur to be studi figur 2 show an exampl of isosw and lw spectra
of two object cep a l 24 104 l and s 106 l 42 104 l the

silic and ice in the cold envelop are seen in absorpt the s 106 spectrum
is typic of a more evolv massiv yso with strong atom and ionic line
in emiss and promin pah featur a similar sequenc ha been shown

the most success model for explain these differ chemic characterist involv accret of speci in an ici mantl dure the precollaps

molecul subsequ drive a rapid hightemperatur gasphas chemistri for
a period of 104 105 yr result in complex satur organ molecul
eg charnley et al 1992 1995 charnley 1997 caselli et al 1993 viti
william 1999 the abund ratio of speci such as ch3 och3 ch3 oh
and so2 h2 s show strong variat with time and may be use as chemic clock for a period of 500030000 yr sinc evapor onc most of the
envelop ha clear the ultraviolet radiat can escap and form a photondomin region pdr at the surround cloud materi in which molecul
are dissoci into radic eg hcn cn and pah molecul excit to
produc infrar emiss the ultracompact h ii region give rise to strong

tabl 1 summar the chemic characterist of the variou physic compon togeth with the observ diagnost at submillimet and infrar wavelength within the singledish submillimet and iso beam mani
of these compon are blend togeth and interferomet observ will
be essenti to disentangl them nevertheless the singledish data are use
becaus they encompass the entir envelop and highlight the domin compon in the beam combin with the abov chemic scenario one may then
attempt to establish an evolutionari sequenc of the sourc
the physic distinct between the hot core and the warm inner envelop
list in tabl 1 is current not clear doe the hot core repres a separ
physic compon or is it simpli the inner warm envelop at a differ stage
of chemic evolut even from an observ point of view there appear to
be differ type of hot core some of them are intern heat by the young
star eg w 3h2 o wherea other may just be dens clump of ga heat
extern eg the orion compact ridg thi point will be further discuss
in 4 and 5 disk are not includ in tabl 1 becaus littl is known about
their chemic characterist or even their exist around highmass yso

intermediatemass yso
intermediatemass premain sequenc star in particular the socal herbig
aeb star have receiv increas observ attent in recent year see
water waelken 1998 for a review these star have spectral type a or
b and show infrar excess due to circumstellar dust typic luminos
are in the rang 102 104 l and sever object have been locat within 1
kpc distanc systemat map of co and the submillimet continuum of a
sampl of object ha been perform by fuent et al 1998 and hen et al
1998 the data show the dispers of the envelop with time start from the
deepli embed phase eg lkh234 to the intermedi stage of a pdr eg
hd 200775 illumin the reflect nebula ngc 7023 to the more evolv
stage where the molecular ga ha disappear complet eg hd 52721
the increas import of photodissoci in the chemistri is probe by
the increas in the cnhcn abund ratio thi ratio ha been shown in
other highmass sourc to be an excel tracer of pdr eg simon et al
1997 jansen et al 1995 line survey of these object in select frequenc
rang would be use to investig their chemic complex especi in the
embed phase
isosw observ of a larg sampl of herbig aeb star have been
perform by van den ancker et al 2000bc in the embed phase shock
indic such as s i 252 m are strong wherea in the later phase pdr indic such as pah are promin an excel exampl of thi evolutionari
sequenc is provid by three herbig ae star in the bd40o 4124 region d 1
kpc the data suggest that in the earli phase the heat of the envelop
is domin by shock wherea in later phase it is control by ultraviolet
photon
isolw data have been obtain for a similar sampl of herbig aeb
star by lorenzetti et al 1999 and giannini et al 2000 and are summar

been detect in some object and indic the presenc of a compact high

inner warm envelop see figur 3 farinfrar line of h2 o are seen in lowmass yso spectra but are weak or absent in those of intermedi and highmass yso with the except of orionkl and sgrb2 eg harwit et al 1998
cernicharo et al 1997 wright et al 2000 the absenc of h2 o line in highermass object may be partli due to the larger distanc of these object result
in substanti dilut in the lw beam howev photodissoci of h2 o to
oh and o by the enhanc ultraviolet radiat may also play a role
in summari both the submillimet and infrar diagnost reveal an evolutionari sequenc from the youngest group i object to group iii object
cf classif by fuent et al 1998 in which the envelop is gradual dispers such a sequenc is analog to the transit from embed class
0i object to more evolv class iiiii object in the case of lowmass star
adam et al 1987 the iso data provid insight into the rel import
of the heat and remov mechan of the envelop at the earli stage of
intermediatemass star format shock due to outflow appear to domin
wherea at later stage radiat is more import

physic structur of the envelop
in order to deriv molecular abund from the observ a good physic model of the envelop is a prerequisit van der tak et al 1999 2000a
outlin the techniqu use to constrain the temperatur and densiti structur
figur 4 the total mass within the beam is deriv from submillimet photometri wherea the size scale of the envelop is constrain from line and
continuum map the dust opac ha been taken from ossenkopf hen
1994 and yield valu for the mass which are consist with those deriv

base on van der tak et al 1999
r 04 wherea at smaller distanc the dust becom optic thick at infrar
wavelength and the temperatur increas more steepli see figur 5 it is
assum that tga tdust consist with explicit calcul of the ga and
dust temperatur by eg doti neufeld 1997 for these high densiti
the continuum data are sensit to temperatur and column densiti but
not to densiti observ of a molecul with a larg dipol moment are need
to subsequ constrain the densiti structur one of the best choic is cs

method the best fit to the data on the infraredbright sourc is obtain for

valu 2 thi deriv assum that the cs abund is constant
through the envelop if it increas with higher temperatur such as may be
the case for hot core the valu of are lower note that the deriv valu of

creas the optic depth at nearinfrar wavelength by a factor of 3 van
der tak et al 1999
for sourc for which interferomet data are avail unresolv compact

emiss is clearli enhanc compar with that expect from the inner tip

helmich 1996 boonman et al 2000b ch4 boogert et al 1998 hcn and

1998 dartoi et al 1998
in the infrar absorpt out of all jlevel is observ in a singl spectrum the excit temperatur tex of the variou molecul calcul
assum lte rang from
100 to 1000 k between sourc give direct
inform on the physic compon in which the molecul resid while
co is wellmix throughout the envelop h2 o hcn and c2 h2 are enhanc
at high temperatur in contrast co2 seem to avoid the hottest ga high
spectral resolut groundbas data of hcn and c2 h2 by carr et al 1995
and laci et al 1989 for a few object suggest line width of at most a few km
s1 exclud an origin in outflow ga
the abund of h2 o hcn and c2 h2 increas by factor of
10 with
increas tex see figur 7 the warm h2 o must be limit to a
1000 au
region sinc the pure rotat line are gener not detect in the 80 isolw beam wright et al 1997 for co2 the abund variat between
sourc is less than a factor of 10 and no clear trend with tex is found for the
same sourc the h2 o and co2 ice abund show a decreas by an order of
magnitud consist with evapor of the ice howev the gasphas h2 o
and co2 abund are factor of 10 lower than expect if all evapor
molecul stay in the ga phase indic that signific chemic process
occur after evapor more detail model use the sourc structur
deriv from submillimet data is in progress

chemic structur submillimet emiss
the jcmt data of the infraredbright object show strong line but lack the
typic crowd hot core spectra observ for object such as w 3h2 o and
ngc 6334 irs1 complex organ such as ch3 och3 and ch3 ocho are detect in some sourc eg gl 2591 ngc 7538 irs1 but are not as promin
as in the comparison sourc yet warm ga is clearli present in these object
is the hot core still too small to be pick up by the singl dish beam or are
the abund of these molecul not yet enhanc
to investig thi question van der tak et al 2000b consid the analysi of two speci h2 co and ch3 oh both speci have mani line throughout

use base on lahui van dishoeck 2000 van dishoeck 1998
the submillimet origin from low and highli energi level given the
physic structur determin in 42 abund profil can be constrain
two extrem but chemic plausibl model are consid i a model with
a constant abund throughout the envelop thi model is motiv by the
fact that pure gasphas reaction scheme do not show larg variat in calcul abund between 20 and 100 k ii a model in which the abund
jump to a higher valu at the ice evapor temperatur td 90 k in thi
model the abund in the outer envelop are set at those observ in cold
cloud so that the onli free paramet is the amount of abund increas
it is found that the h2 co data can be well fit with a constant abund of
a few 109 throughout the envelop howev the high j k data for ch3 oh
requir a jump in it abund from 109 to 107 for the warmer sourc
thi is consist with the deriv excit temperatur h2 co ha a rather
narrow rang of tex 5090 k wherea ch3 oh show tex 30200 k moreov
the interferomet map of ch3 oh rule out constant abund model the
jump observ for ch3 oh is chemic plausibl sinc thi molecul is known
to be present in ici grain mantl with abund of 540 with respect to
h2 o ice ie 107 106 wrt h2 similar increas in the abund of
organ molecul eg ch3 oh c2 h3 cn are found with increas tdust
for a set of hotcor object by ikeda ohishi 1999

comparison with chemic model
both the infrar and submillimet data show increas in the abund of
variou molecul with increas temperatur four type of speci can be
distinguish i passiv molecul which are form in the ga phase freez
out onto grain dure the cold precollaps phase and are releas dure
warmup without chemic modif eg co c2 h2 ii molecul which
are form on the grain dure the cold phase by surfac reaction and are
subsequ releas into the warm ga eg ch3 oh iii molecul which are
form in the warm ga by gasphas reaction with evapor molecul eg
ch3 och3 iv molecul which are form in the hot ga by high temperatur
reaction eg hcn these type of molecul are associ with characterist
temperatur of a tdust 20 k where co is frozen out the presenc of co
ice is thought to be essenti for the format of ch3 oh b tdust 90 k
where all ice evapor on a time scale of 105 yr and c tga 230 k
where gasphas reaction drive the avail atom oxygen into water through
the reaction o h2 oh h2 o ceccarelli et al 1996 charnley 1997
atom oxygen is one of the main destroy of radic and carbon chain so
that it absenc lead to enhanc abund of speci like hcn and hc3 n
in hot ga
water is abundantli form on the grain but the fact that the h2 o abund in the hot ga is not as larg as that of the ice suggest that h2 o is
broken down to o and oh after evapor by reaction with h
3 h2 o can
subsequ be reform in warm ga at temperatur abov 230 k but figur 7 indic that not all avail gasphas oxygen is driven into h2 o as the
model suggest the low abund of co2 in the warm ga is still a puzzl
sinc evapor of abund co2 ice is observ the molecul must be broken down rapidli in the warm ga with no reform through the co oh
co2 reaction see question by minh
46
evolut
the object studi by van der tak et al 2000a are all in an earli stage of
evolut when the young star are still deepli embed in their collaps
envelop nevertheless even within thi narrow evolutionari rang there is
ampl evid for physic and chemic differenti of the sourc thi is
clearli trace by the increas in the gassolid ratio the increas in abund
of sever molecul the decreas in the ice abund and the increas of the
amount of crystallin ice with increas temperatur boogert et al 2000a
the fact that the variou indic involv differ characterist temperatur rang from 50 k evapor of apolar ice to 1000 k tex of
gasphas molecul indic that the heat is not a local effect but that
global warm occur throughout the envelop moreov it cannot be a
geometr lineofsight effect in the midinfrar data sinc the farinfrar
continuum 45100 m and submillimet line data ch3 oh show the same
trend shock with differ fill factor are exclud for the same reason
can we relat thi global warm of the envelop to an evolutionari effect
or is it determin by other factor the absenc of a correl of the abov
indic with luminos or mass of the sourc argu against them be the
sole control factor the onli signific trend is found with the ratio of
12
envelop mass over stellar mass the physic interpret of such a relat
would be that with time the envelop is dispers by the star result in a
higher temperatur throughout the envelop
5
outstand question and futur direct
the result discuss here suggest that the observ chemic abund and
temperatur variat can inde be use to trace the evolut of the sourc
and that as in the case of low and intermediatemass star the dispers of
the envelop play a crucial role the combin of infrar and submillimet
diagnost is veri import in the analysi an import next step would be
to use these diagnost to probe a much wider rang of evolutionari stage
for highmass star especi in the hot core and ultracompact h ii region
stage to develop a more complet scenario of highmass star format the
relat between the inner warm envelop and the hot core is still uncertain
sever object have been observ which clearli have hot ga and evapor
ice includ ch3 oh in their inner region but which do not show the typic
crowd hot core submillimet spectra are these object just on their way to
the hot core chemic phase or is the hot core a separ physic compon
eg a dens shell at the edg of the expand hypercompact h ii region due
to the pressur from the ioniz ga which is still too small to be pick up by
the singledish beam in either case time or evolut play a role and would
constrain the age of the infraredbright sourc to less than a few 104 yr sinc
evapor interferomet data provid evid for the presenc of a separ
physic compon in the inner 1000 au but lack the spatial resolut to
distinguish a shell from ani remnant disk for exampl on kinemat ground
an import differ between high and lowmass object may be the
mechan for the heat and dispers of their envelop for lowmass
yso entrain of materi in outflow is the domin process lada 1999
for intermediatemass star outflow are import in the earli phase but ultraviolet radiat becom domin in the later stage see 3 the situat
for highmass star is still unclear the systemat increas in gassolid ratio
and gasphas abund point to global heat of the ga and dust consist
with a radi mechan howev a clear chemic signatur of ultraviolet radiat on gasphas speci and ice in the embed phase ha not yet
been identifi make it difficult to calibr it effect on the other hand
highmass star are known to have power outflow and wind but a quantit comparison between their effect in heat an extend part of the
envelop and remov materi is still lack geometr effect are more
import in less embed system as is the case for lowmass star where the
circumstellar disk may shield part of the envelop from heat boogert et al
2000b
to what extent doe the chemic evolut pictur also appli to lowmass
star mani of the chemic process and characterist list in tabl 1 are
also known to occur for lowmass yso but sever import diagnost tool
are still lack in particular sensit midinfrar spectroscopi is urgent
need to trace the evolut of the ice for lowmass yso and determin
gassolid ratio also molecul as complex as ch3 och3 and c2 h5 cn have
13
not yet been detect toward lowmass yso although the limit are not veri
stringent eg van dishoeck et al 1995 evapor of ice clearli occur in
lowmass environ as evidenc by enhanc abund of grainsurfac
molecul in shock eg bachil perezgutierrez 1997 but whether a
similar hot core chemistri ensu is not yet known differ in the hh2
ratio and temperatur structur in the precollaps phase may affect the grainsurfac chemistri and the ice composit lead to differ abund of

discuss
m ohishi i agre with the point you mention that the chemic differ
among hot core is due to a differ of evolutionari stage now we have sever wellknown hot core such as orion kl w 3 irs5h2 oirs4 sgrb2
nmnw etc can you give us your person view on the evolutionari differ of these sourc
ef van dishoeck van der tak et al 2000a argu that the infraredbright
object such as w 3 irs5 repres an earlier evolutionari phase than the hot
core on the basi of an anticorrel with the radio continuum the physic
16
pictur is that the ioniz uv radiat and stellar wind push the hottest dust
in the inner region further out decreas the temperatur of the dust and thu
the nearinfrar continuum at the same time the size of the region which can
be ioniz is increas the eros of the envelop thu occur from the insid
out for other sourc infrar diagnost are lack so that the situat is
less clear it would be great if chemistri could help to tie down the time scale
of the variou phase
w irvin how do you interpret the behavior of the pah featur as a function
of evolutionari stage in the sourc that you discuss
ef van dishoeck the absenc of pah featur in the earli embed stage
can be due either to a lack of ultraviolet radiat to excit the featur or to an
absenc of the carrier mansk hen 1999 aa 349 907 have argu
for the case of herbig aeb star that there should be suffici radiat to
excit pah in the envelopedisk system so that the lack is like due to the
absenc of the pah themselv perhap the pah have accret into the
ici mantl at the high densiti in the inner envelop and do not evapor
andor are chemic transform into other more refractori speci on grain
altern the region produc ultraviolet radiat h ii region may be
veri small in these massiv object and the photon may not reach the pahrich
materi or have a veri small beam fill factor onc the envelop break up
and ultraviolet radiat can escap to the less dens outer envelop the pah
featur from those region will appear in spectra taken with larg beam
t gebal you said that there is littl evid of the effect of ultraviolet
radiat on solidst chemistri isnt the 46 m xcn featur a good exampl
of that influenc
ef van dishoeck the xcn featur is inde the best candid for trace
the ultraviolet process of ice if ascrib to ocn it like involv hnco
as a precursor in the laboratori hnco is produc by photochem reaction
of co and nh3 but in the interstellar medium grain surfac chemistri is an
altern possibl which doe not necessarili involv ultraviolet radiat
see ehrenfreund schutt thi volum
yc minh do you have an explan of the low and constant abund of
co2 in the ga phase
ef van dishoeck charnley kaufman 2000 apj 529 l111 argu that
the evapor co2 is destroy by reaction with atom hydrogen at high
temperatur in shock thi is an interest suggest but need to be test
against other speci such as h2 o and h2 s which can be destroy by reaction
with atom hydrogen as well also the amount of materi in the envelop that
can be affect by shock is not clear
