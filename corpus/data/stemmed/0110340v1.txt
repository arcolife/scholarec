we outlin the uniqu role of a muon collid as a higg factori for higg boson reson
product in the schannel physic exampl includ the precis measur of the higg
mass and total width and the result abil to discrimin between the smlike higg boson of
differ model such as between a light sm higg boson and the light higg boson of the mssm the
determin of the spin and coupl via the h decay mode differenti of two nearli
degener heavi higg boson by an energi scan and the abil to explor a gener extend
higg sector possibl with cpviolat coupl the muon collid higg factori could perform
measur that would be highli complementari to higg studi at the lhc and lc it would
be like to play a veri crucial role in fulli understand the higg sector

introduct
a muon collid with cm energi center at the higg boson mass offer a uniqu opportun to produc
higg boson in the schannel and therebi measur the higg mass total width and sever partial width to
veri high precis in the event that onli a smlike higg boson is discov and it properti measur at
the tevatron the lhc and a lc it may prove essenti to build a muon collid to fulli explor the higg
sector in particular the veri narrow width of a standard model sm higg boson cannot be measur
directli at the larg hadron collid lhc or at a futur linear collid lc furthermor there are region
of paramet space for which it will be imposs for either the lhc or a lc to discov the heavier higg
boson of supersymmetri or in the case of a gener twohiggsdoublet or more extend model higg boson
of ani mass with small or zero v v coupl
the valu of a futur higg factori should be discuss in light of recent experiment data while by no
mean definit recent experiment result point in promis direct for higg factori first there is
2 statist evid from lep1 2 3 4 5 for a higg boson near mh 115 gev such a mass is
the
in the optim rang for studi at a higg factori and it is for such a low mass that the muon collid factori
option would add the most inform to data from the lhc and a lc first 115 gev is suffici abov
the zpole that the background from z product and decay to bb is not so larg and the mass is suffici
below the w w threshold that the decay width remain small and the abil of the muon collid to achiev
a veri narrow beam energi spread can be exploit second it is for mass below 120 gev that the lc
will have difficulti get a precis measur of the higg to w w branch ratio result in larg
error for the indirect determin of the total higg width of cours a higg boson in thi mass rang
and have substanti v v coupl is also the most natur interpret of current precis electroweak
data on the theoret side a higg mass of 115 gev is veri suggest of supersymmetri in the minim
supersymmetr model mssm such a mass is near the theoret upper limit of mh 130 gev and would
indic a valu of the supersymmetri paramet tan substanti abov 1 assum stop mass

a higg with mass 115 gev in the context of a largetan supersymmetri scenario would mesh nice
with recent evid for an anomal magnet moment of the muon6 that deviat from the standard model
predict the 26 discrep is natur account for provid tan is rel larg and superparticl

boson in the predict mass rang
while these recent experiment data are not definit they do point to an interest scenario wherebi a
muon collid might prove essenti to the understand of the higg sector of a supersymmetr model the
muon collid could perform at least two measur crucial for detail a susi higg sector 1 accur
measur the properti of a light smlike higg boson and distinguish it from a supersymmetr higg
boson and 2 discov heavi higg boson of supersymmetri and accur measur their properti

muon collid
muon collid have a number of uniqu featur that make them attract candid for futur
accelerators8 the most import and fundament of these deriv from the larg mass of the muon in
comparison to that of the electron thi lead to a the possibl of extrem narrow beam energi spread
especi at beam energi below 100 gev b the possibl of acceler with veri high energi c the
possibl of employ storag ring at high energi d the possibl of use decay of acceler muon to
provid a high luminos sourc of neutrino under activ consider as review elsewher e increas

here our focu is on the higg sector the rel larg mass of the muon compar to the mass of the
electron mean that the coupl of higg boson to is veri much larger than to e e impli much
larger schannel higg product rate at a muon collid as compar to an electron collid see fig 1 for
higg boson with a veri small mev scale width such as a light sm higg boson product rate in the
schannel are further enhanc by the muon collid abil to achiev beam energi spread compar to
the tini higg width in addit there is littl bremsstrahlung and the beam energi can be tune to one part
in a million through continu spinrot measurements9 due to these import qualit differ
between the two type of machin onli muon collid can be advoc as potenti schannel higg factori

if the mh 115 gev lep signal is real or if the interpret of the precis electroweak data as an
indic of a light higg boson with substanti v v coupl is valid 36 then both e e and
collid will be valuabl in thi scenario the higg boson would have been discov at a previou higher
energi collid possibl a muon collid run at high energi and then the higg factori would be built with
a centerofmass energi precis tune to the higg boson mass37 the most like scenario is that the higg
boson is discov at the lhc via gluon fusion gg h or perhap earlier at the tevatron via associ
product q q w h tth and it mass is determin to an accuraci of about 100 mev if a linear collid
ha also observ the higg via the higgsstrahlung process e e zh one might know the higg boson
mass to better
than 50 mev with an integr luminos of 500 fb1 the muon collid would be optim
to run at s mh and thi centerofmass energi would be vari over a narrow rang so as to scan over the
higg reson see fig 2 below

the gener theoret predict within supersymmetr model is that the lightest supersymmetr higg
boson h0 will be veri similar to the hsm when the other higg boson are heavi thi decoupl limit is
veri like to aris if the mass of the supersymmetr particl are larg sinc the higg mass and the
superparticl mass are typic similar in size for most boundari condit choic thu h0 rate will be
veri similar to hsm rate in contrast the heavier higg boson in a typic supersymmetr model decoupl
from v v at larg mass and remain reason narrow as a result their schannel product rate remain

the muon collid role
an assess of the need for a higg factori requir that one detail the uniqu capabl of a muon collid
versu the other possibl futur acceler as well as compar the abil of all the machin to measur

the same higg properti muon collid and a higg factori in particular would onli becom oper
after the lhc physic program is welldevelop and quit possibl after a linear collid program is matur
as well so one import question is the follow if a smlike higg boson and possibl import physic
beyond the standard model have been discov at the lhc and perhap studi at a linear collid what
new inform could a higg factori provid
the schannel product process allow one to determin the mass total width and the cross section
h h x for sever final state x to veri high precis the higg mass total width and the
cross section can be use to constrain the paramet of the higg sector for exampl in the mssm their
precis valu will constrain the higg sector paramet ma0 and tan where tan is the ratio of the two
vacuum expect valu vev of the two higg doublet of the mssm the main question is whether these
constraint will be a valuabl addit to lhc and lc constraint
the expect for the luminos avail at linear collid ha risen steadili the most recent studi
assum an integr luminos of some 500 fb1 correspond to 12 year of run at a few100 fb1 per
year thi luminos result in the product of greater than 104 higg boson per year through the bjorken
higgsstrahlung process e e zh provid the higg boson is kinemat access thi is compar
or even better than can be achiev with the current machin paramet for a muon collid oper at
the higg reson in fact recent studi have describ highluminos linear collid as higg factori
though for the purpos of thi report we will reserv thi term for muon collid oper at the schannel
higg reson
a linear collid with such high luminos can certainli perform quit accur measur of certain
higg paramet such as the higg mass coupl to gaug boson coupl to heavi quark etc18
precis measur of the coupl of the higg boson to the standard model particl is an import test
of the mass gener mechan in the standard model with one higg doublet thi coupl is proport
to the particl mass in the more gener case there can be mix angl present in the coupl precis
measur of the coupl can distinguish the standard model higg boson from the smlike higg boson
typic present in a more gener model if deviat are found their magnitud can be extrem crucial for
constrain the paramet of the more gener higg sector in particular it might be possibl to estim
the mass of the other higg boson of the extend higg sector therebi allow a more focus search for
them

the preliminari scan illustr in fig 2 then a dedic threepoint fine scan10 near the reson peak
use l 02 fb1 of integr luminos correspond to a few year of oper would be perform
for a sm higg boson with a mass suffici below the w w threshold the higg total width is veri small
of order sever mev and the onli process where it can be measur directli is in the schannel at a muon
collid indirect determin at the lc can have higher accuraci onc mh is larg enough that the w w

for some final state x for a higg boson so light that the w w decay mode is not use then the total

115 gev the muon collid
can measur the total width of the higg boson with greater precis than can be achiev use the indirect

becom possibl at lhclc and the lhclc exclus region move rapidli to higher ma0 but at best
becom compar to the 02 fb1 muon collid exclus region third the conclus that with higher
luminos than the 01 fb1 per year current envis for the higg factori thi discrimin would have
incred sensit to ma0 assum that systemat error for the absolut cross section will be smaller than
the statist error fourth we should note that there are high tan scenario in which decoupl set in
veri earli in ma0 and no machin would be abl to set a lower bound on ma0 in particular for such scenario
it would be incorrect to conclud that the absenc

to be correct to veri high precis to account for these addit decay susi loop correct to the bb
coupl might also have to be account for to high precis if the susi spectrum turn out to be light but
these last two caveat also appli to the lc measur
given the abov sensit the next question is the extent to which paramet of the superymmetr higg

assum with mh0 110 gev ma0 400 gev tan 10 and at msusi 1 tev variou observ
were comput as a function of ma0 and tan let us for the moment imagin that mh0 can be comput
theoret with arbitrari accuraci in term of the input susi model paramet were thi the case then the
valu of mh0 would determin ma0 as a function of tan or vice versa given the fix susi break scenario
paramet the bb event rate and to a lesser extent tot
h0 determin the locat along the line allow by the
fix valu of mh0 thi line in ma0 tan paramet space is illustr in the lower figur of fig 5 for the
abov sampl model 14 also shown in these lower figur is the extent to which experiment measur
1
and l 10 fb1 would restrict the locat along thi line
of n h0 bb and tot
h0 for l 01 fb
the accuraci 01 03 mev with which mh0 can be determin experiment at the muon collid would
not significantli broaden thi line for the experiment accuraci of 90 mev at the lhc and 30 mev at
the lc the line turn into the ellips of the upper figur of fig 5 unfortun due to the expect level of
theoret uncertainti in the comput of mh0 the muon collid result are certainli unrealist and even
the lhclc ellips are probabl overli optimist we estim that one might eventu be abl to achiev
a theoret accuraci of 100 mev for the mh0 comput in term of the model paramet current
the accuraci of the theoret comput is 2 3 gev so that much higherloop work will be requir
to reach thi level thi would be compar to the lhc experiment error on mh0 thu the realiti may
be that lhclc ellips of the upper half of fig 5 will be substanti enlarg in ani case the ellips size
in both case would most probabl be determin by the accuraci of the theoret comput of mh0 as a
function of susi paramet a determin of the allow ellipt region includ a reason level of
systemat uncertainti for the mh0 comput should be made despit thi systemat uncertainti from the
mh0 comput it is nonetheless clear that strong constraint would be impos on the allow region in the
multidimension mssm paramet space that includ ma and tan and the susybreak paramet in
order to achiev consist with the measur of mh0 h0 bb and tot

one veri import probe of the physic of a light h that is onli possibl at a muon collid is the possibl

the next goal for a linear collid or a muon collid will be to better measur the higg boson properti

the integr luminos need for a signal observ is present in fig 9 estim statist error

of final state spin correl to purifi the signal of a scalar reson and to confirm the natur of it spin it
is also import to care studi the channel of a supersymmetr higg boson which would allow a

heavi higg boson
as discuss in the previou section precis measur of the light higg boson properti might make
it possibl to detect deviat with respect to expect for a smlike higg boson that would point to a
limit rang of allow mass for the heavier higg boson thi becom more difficult in the decoupl
limit where the differ between a supersymmetr and standard model higg are smaller nevertheless with
suffici precis measur of the higg branch fraction it is possibl that the heavi higg boson
mass can be infer a muon collid lighthigg factori might be essenti in thi process
in the context of the mssm ma0 can probabl 39 be restrict to within 50 gev or better if ma0 500 gev
thi includ the 250 500gev rang of heavi higg boson mass for which discoveri is not possibl via
h 0 a0 pair product at a s 500 gev lc further the a0 and h 0 cannot be detect in thi mass rang
at either the lhc or lc for a wedg of moder tan valu for larg enough valu of tan the heavi
higg boson are expect to be observ in bba0 bbh 0 product at the lhc via their decay and
also at the lc
a muon collid can fill some perhap all of thi moder tan wedg if tan is larg the h 0 and

a coupl proport to tan time a smlike valu are enhanc therebi lead to enhanc
product rate in collis the most effici procedur is the oper the muon collid at maximum

by
look for a peak in the bb final state the h 0 and a0 can be discov and onc discov the machin s
can be set to ma0 or mh 0 and factorylik precis studi pursu note that the a0 and h 0 are typic
broad enough that r 01 would be adequ to maxim their schannel product rate in particular
30 mev if the tt decay channel is not open and 3 gev if it is sinc r 01 is suffici much
higher luminos l 2 10 fb1 yr would be possibl as compar to that for r 001 0003 as
requir for studi the h0
in short for those portion of paramet space character by moder tan and ma0
250 gev which
are particularli difficult for both the lhc and the lc the muon collid would be the onli place that these
extra higg boson can be discov and their properti measur veri precis 40
in the mssm the heavi higg boson are larg degener especi in the decoupl limit where they
are heavi larg valu of tan heighten thi degeneraci as shown in fig 10 a muon collid with suffici
energi resolut might be the onli possibl mean for separ out these state exampl show the h

clearli overlap for the better energi resolut of r 001 the two distinct reson peak are still
visibl but they are smear out and merg into one broad peak for r 006

calcul in term of the selfenergi diagram of the higg bosons23 to fulli exploit thi constraint might

higg threshold measur
the mass width and spin of a smlike higg boson can also be determin by oper either a muon
collid or a linear collid at the zh product threshold the rapid rise in the product near the threshold
is sensit to the higg mass27 furthermor the spin of the higg boson can be determin by examin
the rise in the cross section near threshold howev these measur requir ten of invers femtobarn to
provid a use measur of the mass 100 mev these threshold measur can be perform at a
lc with 100 fb1 of integr luminos an error of less than 100 mev can be achieved27 for mh 150 gev
thi is compar to the other method at energi abov threshold the onli mean to reduc the experiment
error on the higg mass further to below 1 mev is to produc the higg in the schannel at a muon collid
the shape of the zh threshold cross section can also be use to determin the spin and to check the
cp properti of the higgs28 these threshold measur becom of interest for a muon collid in the
case where at least a hundr invers femtobarn of luminos is avail

nonexot nonsupersymmetr sm higg sector extens
although the standard interpret of precis electroweak data is that there should be a light higg
boson with smlike v v coupl altern higg sector model can be construct in which a good fit to the
precis data is obtain even though the higg boson with larg v v coupl is quit heavi 1 tev the
simplest such model 12 is base upon the cpconserv gener twohiggsdoublet model the larg s 0
and t 0 come from the heavi higg with larg v v coupl is compens by an even larger t 0
come from a small m 1 gev is suffici mass split between the h and the other heavi neutral
higg boson the result is a shift in the s 0 t 0 direct rel to the usual mhsm 100 gev
scenario in the sm that remain well within the current 90 cl ellips in the s t plane the first signal for
thi type of scenario would be discoveri of a heavi smlike higg boson at the lhc if such a heavi smlike
higg is discov consist with precis electroweak data would then requir the abov type of scenario
or some other exot new physic scenario
model of thi type cannot aris in the supersymmetr context becaus of constraint on the higg self
coupl come from the susi structur they requir a special nondecoupl form for the potenti that
could aris in model where the twodoublet higg sector is an effect low energi descript up to some scale
of order 10 tev or so for these special potenti form there is typic also a higg boson h h decoupledh0 or h a0 with mh 500 gev and no treelevel v v coupl it primari decay mode would be to bb
or tt depend upon it mass and it coupl would be proport to tan for a substanti rang
of tan thi h could not be detect at either the lhc or the lc 12 in particular at the lc even the
e e z z hh process the
quartic coupl be of guarante strength would onli allow h discoveri
up to 150 gev 250 gev for s 500 gev 800 gev 29
the muon collid could be the key to discov such a h by run at high energi the radi return
tail for e might result in product of a detect number of event in particular if tan 5 oper
at maxim s with r 01 would guarante that the h would be detect as a 4 or higher bump in the
bremsstrahlung tail of the mbb distribut after 3 to 4 year of run altern a scan could be perform
to look for the h the scan procedur depend upon how tot depend on mh in that one must alway have r

ls for such rs as function of s we could imagin devot
l 0003 fb1 to 2000 point separ by 01 gev in s 150 350 gev rang the total luminos
requir would be l 4 fb1 or about 3 year of oper one would find 4 level the h in the bb

one would find the h in bb tt final state
l 001 fb1 to each of 100 point separ by 1 gev in the s 400 500 gev rang the total
luminos employ would be l 1 fb1 or about 110 year for tan 7 8 one would detect the
h in the bb tt final state
in thi way the muon collier would detect the h if mh 2mt and tan
5 or if mh 2mt for ani tan onc
discov s mh could be chosen for the muon collid and it would be possibl to studi the h properti

cp violat
a muon collid can probe the cp properti of a higg boson produc in the schannel one can measur
correl in the final state or if the higg boson is suffici heavi in the tt final state 31 32 in
the mssm at treelevel the higg state h0 h 0 and a0 are cp eigenst but it ha been note recent
that sizabl cp violat is possibl in the mssm higg sector through loop correct involv the third
gener squarks33 34 as note earlier in the mssm the two heavi neutral higg boson h 0 be cpeven and a0 be cpodd are almost degener with a mass split compar or less than their width if
there are cpviolat phase in the neutral higg potenti these will caus these cp eigenst to mix the
result mass split between the eigenst can be larger than their width the excel mass resolut
at the muon collid would make it possibl separ the mass of the h 0 and a0 boson the measur mass
differ could be combin with the mass sum rule to provid a power probe of thi physic as alreadi
note variou cp asymmetri in the tt final state can be observ as well and a muon collid is an ideal
place to look for these effect 31 32
the most ideal mean for determin the cp natur of a higg boson at the muon collid is to employ
transvers polar muon for h product at a muon collid with muon coupl given by the form

a proton sourc that is at least two time as intens as that need for the studi discuss in previou section

conclus and plan for futur facil
around 2006 the lhc will begin take data hope reveal the path that particl physic will take
in the next centuri at the moment there are a few experiment hint suggest that a higg boson might
be just around the corner and there are intrigu indic from the anomal magnet moment of the
muon that supersymmetr particl may be easili detect at the lhc thi scenario would present a strong
argument for the construct of a lc to studi thi interest physic which would be at a scale light enough
to be probe a muon collid could play a crucial role in sever way first a schannel lighthigg factori
would provid crucial precis measur of the h0 properti includ the onli accur measur
of it coupl deviat of these properti with respect to expect for the sm higg boson
can in turn impos critic constraint on the mass of heavier higg boson and other susi paramet
among other thing the heavier higg boson might be shown to definit lie within reach of muon collid
schannel product further it could be that the heavier h 0 and a0 cannot be detect at the lhc or lc
a scenario that aris in the mssm for exampl for moder tan valu and ma0 mh 0
250 gev
sinc their detect in schannel product at the muon collid would be rel certain the muon collid
would be an essenti compon in elucid the full physic of the higg sector further there are even
nonsupersymmetr scenario in which one onli see a smlike higg as the lhc and lc probe scale below
a tev but yet muon collid higg factori studi would reveal addit higg boson use schannel higg
product a muon collid would also provid particularli power possibl for studi the cp natur of
the higg boson that are found such cp determin might be absolut crucial to a full understand
of the higg sector final one should not forget that the muon collid might prove to be the best approach
to achiev the highest energi possibl in the least amount of time construct of a higg factori would
