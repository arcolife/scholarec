abstract
in thi paper we introduc an estim of the commerci effici of santilli hadron reactorstm of molecular type 1 patent
and intern patent pend which convert a liquid feedstock
such as automot antifre and oil wast citi or farm liquid wast
crude oil etc into the clean burn magnegastm plu heat acquir
by the liquid feedstock the convers is done via a new process
base on a certain flow of the liquid feedstock through a submerg
electr arc between carbonbas electrod and other featur the
commerci effici is defin as the ratio between the total energi output energi in magnega plu heat and the electr energi
use for it product while the scientif effici is the usual
ratio between the total energi output and the total energi input the
sum of the electr energi plu the energi in the liquid feedstock as
well as that in the carbon electrod needless to say the scientif
effici is alway smaller than one becaus of the conserv of
energi howev a peculiar featur of santilli hadron reactor
of molecular type is that their commerci effici is consider
0
bigger than one name the reactor are capabl of tap energi
from the liquid feedstock and the carbon rod a primari purpos
of thi paper is to show that convent thermochemistri doe inde predict a commerci effici bigger than one although their
valu is consider smaller than the actual effici measur in
the reactor thu indic the applic of the cover hadron
chemistri from which the reactor have receiv their name under
the condit that the reaction run at temperatur t 25o c and
pressur p 1 atm the chemic composit of the combust ga
is convent and all thermochem calcul process are convent we reach an upper limit of the commerci effici of 311
for the use of pure water as feedstock and of 311 to 75 for a mixtur
of ethyleneglicol and water with increas rel consumpt of
ethyleneglicol with respect to the consumpt of carbon rod the
studi of the heat produc by the reaction lead to larg diverg
between the thermochem predict and experiment data of at
least a factor of three such diverg can onli be explain with
deviat from quantum chemistri in favor of the cover hadron
chemistri and in particular the indic larg diverg can onli
be explain with the assumpt that the produc combust ga

introduct
in thi paper we introduc an estim of the commerci effici of santilli hadron reactorstm of molecular type 1 patent and intern
patent pend which convert a liquid feedstock into the clean burn
magnegastm plu heat acquir by the liquid feedstock
the reactor oper via a new process base on a certain flow of the liquid
feedstock through a submerg electr arc between submerg carbonbas
electrod for which reason the reactor are also call plasmaarcflowtm
reactor and other featur
the commerci effici 1 is defin as the ratio between the total
energi output energi in magnega plu heat and the electr energi use
for it product while the scientif effici is the usual ratio between
the total energi output and the total energi input the sum of the electr
energi plu the energi in the liquid feedstock as well as that in the carbon electrod unless otherwis specifi the word effici is refer
hereon to the commerci effici the latter name origin from the
fact that liquid wast carri an incom rather than have a cost and for
thi reason they are not includ in commerci calcul of oper
cost
needless to say the scientif effici is alway smaller than one becaus of the conserv of energi howev a peculiar featur of santilli
hadron reactor of molecular type is that their commerci effici is consider bigger than one name the reactor are capabl of tap energi
from the liquid feedstock and the carbon rod
a primari purpos of thi paper is to show that convent thermochemistri doe inde predict a commerci effici bigger than one although
their valu is consider smaller than the actual effici measur in the
reactor thu indic the applic of the cover hadron chemistri
from which the reactor have receiv their name
by it elementari chemic content magnega is similar to the water ga
or synthesi ga although we should emphas that magnega is produc
under a dc electr arc and reveal an unusu chemic structur character by the presenc of heavi molecular mass cluster which have not been
identifi by ga chromatographi massspectroscopi and infrar spectroscopi gcmsir test among about 135000 speci 1 2 thi featur
may be natur attribut to the influenc of the plasma arc and relat

strong extern magnet field which can lead to new coupl of co and
h2 molecul and other new effect
in sec 2 and 3 we consid in detail convent chemic reaction in
a plasmaarcflow reactor oper with pure water or ethyleneglicol and
water mixtur as feedstock we treat the ga produc as a simpl mixtur
of carbon monoxid co and hydrogen h2 view as ideal gase to simplifi
consider and calcul it combust heat
we estim the upper theoret limit of the effici of the reactor
by use onli chemic energi balanc equat the effici is defin
as a ratio between the total energi releas includ combust heat of
magnega to the energi input electr consum such effici is over
uniti due to the fact that the sum of the combust heat of the ga and
the heat acquir by the liquid is bigger than the electr energi need
for their product it is therefor evid that for the case of water as
feedstock the miss energi origin from the combust of carbon with
oxygen origin from the separ of water thi is due to the fact that
the origin water is reproduc in the combust and therefor cannot
contribut to the total effici
independ experiment test of the effici of the plasmaarcflow
reactor clearli confirm such a commerci overun 1 sinc the measur
valu of the overun is of about 3 to 5 for antifreez stock at atmospher
pressur with bigger valu for bigger pressur and power our theoret
result is that the upper limit of the commerci overun rang from 311
to 75 in a remark correspond to the test
howev it should be note that whenev the studi is specifi to
the heat acquir by the liquid feedstock a discrep of a factor of three
origin between experiment data and the predict of thermochem
calcul an addit discrep also of a factor of about three exist
between the measur combust heat of magnega and it predict valu
the abov discrep are of such a magnitud to support the hypothesi that the chemic composit of magnega is that santilli magnecul 1
it should also be note that our calcul are base as usual on thermochem valu at t 25o c and pressur p 1 atm while the arc plasma
reaction zone is character by much higher temperatur therefor our
result are of preliminari charact also in the present paper we do not
consid issu pertain to mechan of the reaction thermodynam

some electr energi is dissip into heat therefor the real effici of
the reactor is less than that given by eq 13
in gener higher consumpt rate of ethyleneglicol and carbon rod
per 1 kwh electr consum impli bigger real effici thi is due
to higher valu of k which depend on design of the reactor in turn the
consumpt rate depend on reaction rate volum of the reaction zone
rate of the reactant ethyleneglicol water gasifi carbon rod input
rate of the product co and h2 remov stoichimetr ratio etc the
reaction rate depend on temperatur and pressur the volum of the reaction zone depend on size of the plasma arc and on the size of surround
hightemperatur region the rate of the reactant inlet and product outlet depend on the rate of the carbon rod gasif geometri and veloc
of the liquid flow and pressur here it is import to identifi a limit
factor eg the slowest rate among the abov in order to better repres
the effici of the reactor

total heat produc
we now add the combust heat of the produc coh2 11 ga the
theoret valu is 315 btucf to the measur heat produc by the
reactor in order to estim the total heat produc by ad 315 btucf
to the heat 59 and 60 we obtain the total measur heat produc
k3988 315 btucf of the coh2 ga

and
for the case of 0 and 50 recombin of water respect here
the coeffici k 0 k 1 is defin by 57 and can be given in some
approxim valu by studi thermodynam of a specif reactor thi
coeffici account for all heat loss includ that at tungsten anod
by assum that the total heat produc is approxim equal to the
energi input see the energi input in vi of sec 44 and vii of sec 45
that is by assum the effici 1 we have
k3988 315 btucf of the coh2 ga

73
and
k6990 315 btucf of the co h2 ga

7091 btucf of the coh2 ga
74
therefor we obtain
k 0948
75
k 0969
76
and
respect the measur total heat produc is
4094 btucf of the coh2 ga
77
7091 btucf of the coh2 ga
78
and
which is valid under condit 73 and 74 ie that the total measur
heat produc is equal to the energi input
the abov estim 75 and 76 mean that about 95 of the electr energi input is dissip into the environ and the remain 5
contribut to the endotherm chemic reaction
the follow remark is in order we can account for addit heat
product which could not be account by the coeffici k by ad

conclus
in thi paper we have studi the upper limit of the commerci effici
1 simpli refer i the text as effici of santilli hadron reactor of
molecular type also call plasmaaarcflow reactor 1
for the case of pure water we have obtain the upper limit 311 while
for the mixtur of ethyleneglicol and water the effici is given by eq
13 see fig 1 and 2 and rise from 311 to about 75 with increas of
the rel consumpt of ethyleneglicol with respect to that of carbon
rod these result are base on the assumpt that all thermochem
process are convent and have been obtain at at t 25o c and p 1
atm
similar calcul can be made for differ waterbas liquid wast
provid that their main chemic composit is known
we have account for the plasma product and obtain a more detail view on the step of the entir process thi ha allow us to account
for the water recombin and the heat product coeffici
the comparison of the theoret result with measur lead to a
sharp discrep between theoetic predict and experiment data in
fact the fit of the measur commerci overun lead to a predict
which is about three time smaller than the measur heat on the other
hand the fit of the measur heat product lead to the predict
that the measur commerci overun is smaller than that predict
the implic of the abov calcul are the follow the fact that
the heat produc in the plasmaarcflow reactor is less than 13 the theoret predict constitut clear evid that magnega is not compos
of convent h2 and co molecul altern the indic evid
prohibit the complet format of h2 and co it then follow that magnega is inde compos of cluster call santilli magnecul 1 which are
compos of cluster of individu h c and o atom dimer oh ch or co
in singl bond and ordinari molecul h2 and co under a new attract
between opposit polar creat by magnet and electr polar of
the orbit of individu atom into toroid
on the other side the fact that the heat content of magnega is about
3 time that predict is addit strong evid that magnega again
contain nonmolecular bond in fact said h c and o atom may bond
into h2 and co at the time of combust thu releas extra energi as
20
such the abov two larg deviat complement each other rather nice
it is evid that no addit quantit studi of the commerci effici of plasmaarcflow reactor can be done without a more accur
knowledg of the new chemic speci of magnecul as well as a reinterpret of thermochem process via the cover hadron chemistri
