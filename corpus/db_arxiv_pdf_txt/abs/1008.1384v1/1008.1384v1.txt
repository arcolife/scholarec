enveloping algebras at roots of unity provide examples of G-categories.

Introduction
A breakthrough in the theory of invariants of knots came with the discovery of the Jones polynomial [J]
and its generalizations (HOMFLY and Kauffman). Then it was shown in [RT] that such invariants as well
as invariants of tangled graphs can be obtained from quantized universal enveloping algebras of simple Lie
algebras.
In this paper we extend the construction of invariants of links from [RT] (for details see [T1]). We construct
invariants of tangles in R2 × [0, 1] with a flat connection in a principal G-bundle (where G is a simple complex
algebraic group) over the complement of a tangle. The invariant is a functor from the category of G-tangles
to a given G-category (see sections 1–3 for definitions). The invariant of a tangle with a gauge class of flat
connections in the complement is defined as the image of the corresponding G-tangle.
In section 1 of this paper first we describe the moduli space of flat connections in the complement to a
tangle in R2 × [0, 1]. Then we define the category of tangles with gauge classes of flat connections in their
complements. The construction is essentially the same as π-tangles introduced and studied by Turaev in
[T2]. In section 2 we define the category of G-colored tangle diagrams and show that it is naturally equivalent
to the category of tangles with flat G-connections in their complements. In section 3 we introduce the notion
of a G-category, which is very similar but different from that of [T2]. In section 4 we construct invariants
of G-tangles. In sections 5–7 we show that representations of Uε provide examples of GL∗2 -categories and
therefore provide invariants of tangles with GL2 -connections in their complements.

1. Tangles with flat G-connections in their complements
1.1. Tangles and diagrams. Let I ≡ [0, 1] be the closed unit interval. A geometric tangle t ⊂ R2 × I
is the image of a smooth embedding I ⊔ . . . ⊔ I ⊔ S 1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ S 1 → R2 × I with oriented components such
k times

l times

that ∂t ⊂ R2 × ∂I, and t intersects the boundary R2 × ∂I perpendicularly. We have ∂t = ∂+ t ⊔ ∂− t
where ∂+ t = (R2 × {1}) ∩ ∂t and ∂− t = (R2 × {0}) ∩ ∂t. The geometric tangle t is called standard if
∂+ t = {(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 1) . . . (0, n, 1)} and ∂− t = {(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0) . . . (0, m, 0)} for some n, m ∈ Z>0 . We will
say that such tangle has type (m, n).

Denote by Dt the image of t under the projection
(1)

p : R2 × I → R × I, (x, y, z) → (y, z)

together with the additional information at each self-crossing point about underpassing and overpassing
segments. The projection Dt is called regular if its only singularities are double points at which the images
of the corresponding components of t intersect transversally. The ambient isotopy class of a regular projection
Dt is called a diagram of the tangle t. When it is not confusing we will use the same notation Dt for diagrams
and regular projections.
The diagram of a tangle can be regarded as the isotopy class of a smooth embedding of a graph with
four-valent vertices of two types and one-valent vertices. These are the double points and the boundary
points, respectively. The edges of the graph are the segments running between the vertices. A vertex of Dt
is called positive if it is a double point and the angle between upper and lower components is positive. If
the angle is negative, the vertex is called negative, see Fig. 1. Each such embedding is always a diagram
of some tangle. Two diagrams are called Reidemeister equivalent if one can be obtained from another by a
finite sequence of Reidemeister moves (see Figs 2–4).

A tangle is the isotopy class of a geometric tangle. Tangles are in bijection with Reidemeister classes of
diagrams.
A geometric framing of a geometric tangle t is a continuous nonsingular section of the normal bundle to t.
A framing of a tangle is the isotopy class of a geometric framing. A framing is standard if it is parallel to the
x-axis at ∂± t with positive projection to this axis. It is clear that every framed geometric tangle with such
framing at the boundary is isotopically equivalent to a framed geometric tangle with the framing parallel to
x-axis. Framed tangle is the isotopy class of a framed geometric tangle with the standard framing.
Two diagrams of tangles are called framed Reidemeister equivalent if they are connected by a sequence of
moves in Figs 2, 3, 5.
Framed Reidemeister classes of diagrams are in bijection with the framed tangles.

1.2. Flat G-connections in the complement of a tangle and G-tangles. Let E be a trivial principal
G-bundle over R2 × I and At ∈ Ω1 (R2 × I\t, g) be the 1-form representing a flat connection in E over

fundamental groupoid of (R2 × I)\t in G.

Let Em be a trivial principal G-bundle over R , and α be the g-valued 1-form of a flat connection in E over
R2 \{(0, 1), . . . , (0, m)}. Assume that α(x, y) decays sufficiently fast when y goes to −∞ so that the parallel
2

transport operator of α along a path connecting (x0 , y0 ) with (x, y) in R has a limit as y0 → −∞. Let [α]
be the gauge class of α with respect to gauge transformations trivial at ∞. Let γi be a path which starts at
(0, −∞) encircles points (0, 1), . . . , (0, i) and then returns to (0, −∞) (see Fig. 6). We can identify the class
[α] with an element of Gm = G × · · · × G so that the group element gi in the collection (g1 , . . . , gm ) ∈ Gm
is the holonomy along the path γi .

Figure 6.
Let α and β be flat connections in Em and En , respectively. Denote by At (α, β) the space of flat
G-connections over the complement of t which, when restricted to R2 × {0} \ {(0, 1, 0), . . . , (0, m, 0)} and
R2 × {1} \ {(0, 1, 1), . . . , (0, n, 1)}, coincide with α and β, respectively, and which decay sufficiently fast
when y → −∞ (so that the parallel along a path connecting (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and (x, y, z) has a finite limit when
y0 → −∞).
If Gt is the group of gauge transformations trivial at infinity, the quotient space
Mt ([α], [β]) = At (α, β)/Gt is by definition the moduli space of those flat G-connections in the complement
of t which, when restricted to two boundary components R2 × {0} \ ∂t and R2 × {1} \ ∂t, give representatives
of the gauge classes [α] and [β] respectively.

Following [T2], denote Ct = (R2 × I)\t and consider the fundamental group of Ct with the base point in
{0} × [−∞, L] × I with t ⊂ R × [L + 1, ∞] × I. The set of such base points is contractible and we will write
π1 (Ct ) for the fundamental group, suppressing the base point. We will call such base points left base points.
It is clear that an element of Mt ([α], [β]) defines a representation of π1 (Ct ). Gauge classes of boundary
values [α] and [β] become elements of Gm and Gn respectively, defined as holonomies along γi (see above).
Thus, the space Mt ([α], [β]) can be identified with a subspace of G-tangles [T2], where a G-tangle is defined
as a pair consisting of a framed oriented tangle t and a group homomorphism ρ : π1 (Ct ) → G.
Let t and t′ be two standard isotopically equivalent geometric tangles. An isotopy bringing t to t′ lifts to
an isomorphism between G-connections over the complements of t and t′ and therefore to an isomorphism
between corresponding moduli spaces of flat G-connections. The isomorphism class of the moduli spaces
generated by these isomorphisms can be identified with the equivalence class of pairs (t, At ) with respect
to isotopies of tangles, their pull-backs acting on connections and gauge transformations from Gt . We will
denote the obtained set of classes by M[t] ([α], [β]).
From now on we will work with G-tangles. The geometric picture with flat connections will be used only
once below when we shall assign a geometrical meaning to G-colorings of diagrams.
Let v = (x, y, z) ∈ t ⊂ R2 × I and γv ⊂ Ct be a (homotopy) path which starts at a left base point then
goes to the point (x, y + δ, z) ”over” the tangle, then returns to the base point ”under” the tangle. Here δ is
sufficiently small and we assume that t is transversal to (x, y)-plane at (x, y, z). We will call such path (the
homotopy class thereof) standard for v = (x, y, z).

1.3. The category of G-tangles. Objects of the category T (G) of G-tangles are finite sequences {(ε1 , g1 ), . . . , (εn , gn )}
with εi = ±1, gi ∈ G. Morphisms from {(ε1 , g1 ), . . . , (εm , gm )} to
{(σ1 , h1 ), . . . , (σn , hn )} are G-tangles.
Here m is the number of connected components of (R2 × {0}) ∩ t and n is the number of connected components of (R2 × {1}) ∩ t. The signs εi and σi show the orientation of the boundary components. If ′′ +′′ ,
the component is oriented upward and if ′′ −′′ , it is oriented downward. The representation ρ : π1 (Ct ) → G
should agree with {gi } and {hi } in the following way. If γi+ is a path from a left base point encircling
boundary points (0, 1, 0), . . . (0, i, 0) in the vicinity of R2 × {0} then ρ(γi+ ) = gi . Similarly for a path γi−
encircling points (0, 1, 1), . . . , (0, i, 1) in the vicinity of R2 × {1} we have ρ(γi− ) = hi .
The composition of morphisms is defined by gluing tangles. The identity morphism of
{(ε1 , g1 ), . . . , (εn , gn )} to itself is the trivial braid with the representation of the fundamental group defined
by g1 , . . . , gn .
Remark 1. The category T (G) can also be defined in more geometrical terms of gauge classes of flat
connections. Objects are sequences (ε1 , . . . , εn ; [α]) where [α] is a gauge class of a flat connection over
R2 \{(0, 1) . . . (0, n)} in the trivial principal G-bundle over R2 and εi = ±1. Morphisms between (ε1 , . . . , εm ; [α])

and (σ1 , . . . , σn , [β]) are elements of M[t] ([α], [β]) i.e. equivalence classes of pairs (t, At ) described in the
previous subsection.
2. The category of G-colored diagrams
2.1. Factorizable groups and Lie groups. We say that group G is factorizable into two subgroups
G± ⊂ G if any element g ∈ G can be represented in a unique way as
−1
g = g+ g−

(2)
where g± ∈ G± .

If G is a complex algebraic Lie group (later we will focus on this case) we will say that it is factorizable if
there exists a Zariski open neighborhood G′ ⊂ G of 1 such that every element of G′ has a unique factorization
(2). Notice that in this case any l ∈ g = Lie(G) has a unique decomposition
l = l+ − l−
where l± ∈ g± = Lie(G± ).
Remark 2. We can choose G+ = {e} and G− = G. We call it trivial factorizability.
Let G be a factorizable group. Define a binary operation
g ⋆ h = g+ h+ (g− h− )−1
which obviously defines a group structure on G with the same identity element as for the original group
−1
structure. The inverse of g in this group is i(g) = g+
g− . This operation corresponds to the multiplication

of the group G+ × G− under the mapping G+ × G− → G, (g+ , g− ) → g+ (g− )−1 . In what follows, we shall
denote this group G∗ .
2.2. G-colorings of diagrams. Let t be a standard geometric tangle and Dt , its diagram with the set of
edges E(Dt ). Assume that G is a factorizable group.
Definition 1. The map E(Dt ) → G which associates to edge e element xe ∈ G is called a G-coloring of
diagram Dt if at each double point it satisfies the relations
xbv = (xav )−1
± xcv (xav )± ,

xav = (xcv )∓ xdv (xcv )−1
∓ ,

depending on whether the intersection is positive or negative. Here the enumeration of edges is the same as
on Fig. 7.
Let xL , xR : G × G → G be mappings acting as
(3)

xL (x, y) = x− yx−1
− ,

−1
xR (x, y) = xL (x, y)+
xxL (x, y)+

In terms of these maps the definition above means that at positive double points we have (xa , xb ) =
(xL (xc , xd ), xR (xc , xd )) and at negative double points (xc , xd ) = (xL (xa , xb ), xR (xa , xb )).

The following proposition is due to Weinstein and Xu [WX] in the context of factorizable Poisson–Lie
groups.
Proposition 1. The map R : G × G → G × G acting as (x, y) → (xL (y, x), xR (y, x)) satisfies the settheoretical Yang–Baxter equation:
R12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12
Here all mapping act from G×3 to itself. The mapping R12 acts as R in the first two factors and trivially
in the last one. The other mappings act in a similar way. The subindices indicate in which factors the
mapping acts non-trivially.
It follows from this proposition that if the G-coloring of lower edges of both diagrams on Fig. 2 are x, y, z,
then the colorings of upper edges of the diagrams (which are determined by the diagrams and the coloring
of lower edges) are the same for both diagrams. In other words, the G-coloring is compatible with the third
Reidemeister move. It is easy to see that the G-coloring is also compatible with other framed Reidemeister
moves.
Let (D, c) and (D′ , c′ ) be two G-colored diagrams which are Reidemeister equivalent. Then, since in each
Reidemeister move the coloring of a new diagram is uniquely defined by the coloring of the initial diagram,
c′ is uniquely determined by c. Thus, we have Reidemeister classes of G-colored diagrams.
2.3. The category of G-colored diagrams. Let G be a factorizable group. Define category D(G) of
G-colored diagrams as follows.
Objects of the category are sequences {(ε1 , x1 ), . . . , (εn , xn )} where εi = ± and xi ∈ G and the empty set.
Morphisms between {(ε1 , x1 ), . . . , (εn , xn )} and {(σ1 , y1 ), . . . , (σm , ym )} are Reidemeister classes of Gcolored diagrams with the orientation of the boundary edges (adjacent to 1-valent vertices) defined by εi
and σj as it is shown on Fig. 8 and with the G-colorings of the boundary edges given by εi (xi ) and σj (yj )

Consider the map F : T (G) → D(G) acting on objects as

where Dt is a diagram of the tangle t, c is the coloring of Dt which we define below, and [(Dt , c)] the colored
framed Reidemeister class of (D, c).
Consider a standard path γv associated with point v ∈ t. Let e1 , . . . , ei be the edges of Dt intersected
by the projection of γv , and ε1 , . . . , εi the signs of the projections of their orientations to the vertical axis.
Then the holonomy gv = gi along γv associated to ρ is given by formula (5), where x1 , . . . , xi now are the
colors of edges e1 , . . . , ei . It is easy to see that this correspondence between ρ and the edge colors is one to
one, and thus the mapping F is invertible.
It is easy to see that the map F a functor. To prove this it remains to show that F (f g) = F (f )F (g) for
morphisms f and g, which is obvious. It is also clear that this functor is an equivalence of categories.
2.5. A geometric version of the functor F . Now consider a geometric description of the category T (G)
and describe the functor F in this terms.
To define the action of F on objects we consider a special representative α
˜ of the gauge class [α]. Namely,
α
˜ is continuous and vanishes outside the strips {(x, y)| x ∈ R, i − ǫ < y < i + ǫ} for some 0 < ǫ < 1/2. Let γi±
be paths connecting points (0, i − 1/2) and (0, i + 1/2) which go around (0, i) in the clock-wise direction for
γi− and in the counter clock-wise direction for γi+ . These paths are shown as (−) and (+) paths respectively
on Fig. 10.

where xi = holγi (˜
To define the action of F on morphisms, first, let us look at the geometry of the projection p. The
preimages of edges of Dt form a system of “walls” p−1 (e) ⊂ R2 × I, e ∈ E(Dt ), intersecting at lines which
are preimages of the vertices of Dt . Let At be a flat connection over the complement of t. If the tangle is
not a link all chambers bounded by walls including the ”outer” chambers are simply connected so the flat

INVARIANTS OF TANGLES WITH FLAT CONNECTIONS

11

connection At can be trivialized inside these chambers, except a thin neighborhood of walls. If the tangle is
a link, the outer chamber is not simply connected, but we still can trivialize the flat connection inside this
chamber since the link can be placed into a ball and the outside of a ball is a simply connected region in
R2 × I. Thus, we can trivialize the flat connection in each chamber outside of a thin neighborhood of walls.
Assume that this thin neighborhood is such that at the boundary it is inside of strips x ∈ R, i − ǫ < y < i + ǫ.
The tangle t separates each wall into two semi-infinite parts. Let e be an edge of Dt , denote by p−1 (e)−
the part of the wall p−1 (e) which is semi-infinite in the negative x-direction and by p−1 (e)+ the other part
of this wall. Since the connection is flat and since now it is trivial inside the chambers (except of a thin
neighborhood of walls), the holonomy through the wall p−1 (e) along any path that is based on a pair of
points separated by this wall and which are outside of a thin neighborhood of the wall, depends only on
the homotopy class of the path. Let us call the path positive if its orientation together with the orientation
of the edge e and with the direction of the projection p form positively oriented triple of vectors in R3
with the standard orientation. This produces two elements x± (e) of G which we can assign to the edge e
corresponding to holonomies along positive paths through p−1 (e)± . The product x(e) = x+ (e)x− (e)−1 is the
holonomy along a closed path that crosses first the wall p−1 (e)+ in the positive direction and then p−1 (e)−
in the negative direction. If G is factorizable there exists unique pair x(e)± which factorizes x(e) as above
with x(e)± ∈ G± , and one can choose the connection At so that x± (e) = x(e)± . This gives us an assignment
e → x(e) of group elements to edges of the diagram. Notice that this assignment does not depend on base
points inside chambers and depends only on the gauge class of the flat connection.
The holonomy along a path connecting two points based inside chambers is the product of holonomies
through the walls intersected by this path. Given a tangle t and its diagram Dt these holonomies can be
computed by the wall crossing rule (see Fig. 15). Horizontal edges on Fig. 15 represent parts of the path.
Vertical edges represent parts of the tangle (walls). Under-crossings and over-crossings show whether the
path went through p−1 (e)− or p−1 (e)+ respectively where e is the corresponding edge of the diagram. The
holonomy gained at the crossing is given in terms of the G coloring of e.
To show that the map assigning group elements to edges constructed above gives G-colorings, one should
consider pairs of paths from Figs 11–14. Isotopy equivalence of these paths implies the equality of the
corresponding holonomies. Computation of them according to the “wall-crossing rules” described above
gives the identities in the definition of the G-coloring.
3. Braided G-categories
3.1. Braided G-categories. A braided group is a pair (G, R : G × G → G × G) where G is a group and
the map R satisfies the following requirements
(1) m ◦ R = m′
(2) R ◦ (m × id) = (m × id) ◦ R23 ◦ R13
(3) R ◦ (id ×m) = (id ×m) ◦ R12 ◦ R13

where m is the multiplication and m′ is the opposite multiplication in G. In particular, R satisfies the
set-theoretical Yang–Baxter equation
R12 ◦ R13 ◦ R23 = R23 ◦ R13 ◦ R12 .
An example of a braided group is the pair (G∗ , R) where G∗ is a factorized group G with multiplication
m(x, y) = x ⋆ y and R is given by (3).
For a set A we will say that category C is fibered over A if
• There is a projection π : Ob(C) → A
• HomC (X, Y ) = ∅, if π(X) = π(Y )

Recall that a monoidal category is a category with a functor ⊗ : C × C → C. This functor is given together
with the natural transformations a : otimes ◦ ⊗ × id ≃ ⊗ ◦ id × ⊗ which is called an associativity constraint.
This natural transformation should satisfy the pentagon identity [ML]. In addition to this, a monoidal
category has an identity object 11 given together with a system of functorial isomorphisms lX : 11 ⊗ X ≃ X
and rX : 1!1 ⊗ X ≃ X which satsfy some natural conditions [ML].
A monoidal category fibered over a group G is called a G-category if
• π(X ⊗ Y ) = π(X)π(Y )
• π(11) = e ∈ G

Associativity constraint and functorial morphisms rX and lX should act fiber-wise. From now on we will
work only with strict monoidal categories: we assume that the associativity constrain is trivial (see [ML] for
details on what this exactly means).
Recall that a monoidal category is called rigid if any object X has a left dual object X ∗ , the injection
and evaluation mappings iX : 11 → X ⊗ X ∗ and eX : X ∗ ⊗ X → 11, and if the triple X ∗ , iX , eX is unique
up to an isomorphism. In a rigid monoidal category double dual is not necessary isomorphic to the object
itself, and, in particular, each object has left and right duals.
A G-category C is called rigid if it is a rigid monoidal category and in addition to the properties listed
above one has
π(X ∗ ) = π(∗ X) = π(X)−1
where ∗ X and X ∗ are left and right duals to X respectively. The evaluation and injection morphisms act
fiber-wise.
Now assume that the group G is a braided group. A category C is called braided rigid G-category if it is
a rigid G-category and in addition to this it has the following properties:
(1) There exists a functor B : C × C → C × C such that the following diagram is commutative

ˇ = R ◦ P , and P (x, y) = (y, x). We will write B : (X, Y ) → (XL (X, Y ), XR (X, Y )) for the

action of B. This property is the lifting of the property 1. of braided group G to the category C.

(2) The functor B satisfies the following identities ( for functors C × C × C → C × C × C)
B ◦ (⊗ × id) = (id × ⊗) ◦ (B × id) ◦ (id × B)
and the same identity for B −1 . This properties of B are liftings of properties 2. and 3. of the braided
group G to the category C.
(3) There exists an isomorphism of functors c which makes the following diagram commutative

In other words, there exists a system of functorial isomorphisms
cX,Y : X ⊗ Y → XL (X, Y ) ⊗ XR (X, Y ).
(4) The commutativity constraint should satisfy the hexagon axioms
cX⊗Y,Z = (cX,XL (Y,Z) ⊗ id)(id ⊗cY,Z )
cX,Y ⊗Z = (cX,Y ⊗ id)(cXR (X,Y ),Z ⊗ id)
A braided G-category is called a ribbon category if it in addition to being a G-category has a system of
functorial morphisms {µX : X → X ∗∗ }X∈Ob(C) such that
• µX⊗Y = µX ⊗ µY
• µX ∗ = (µ∗X )−1
• µ11 = id
When it will not be misleading we will shorten the name “ rigid braided ribbon G-category” to “ribbon
G-category”. The theorem 1 provides an example of a G-category.
When G+ = e are G− = G the notion of the G-category introduced above is equivalent to the one
introduced in [T2].
3.2. The category of G-colored diagrams is a ribbon G-category.
Theorem 1. The category of G-colored framed diagrams is a ribbon G∗ -category where G∗ = G+ × G− .

Proof. First, let us check that R satisfies the required properties. The first identity for R is equivalent to
xL (x, y) · xR (x, y) = x · y
The second identity for R is equivalent to
xL (x, y · z) = xL (x, y) · xL (xR (x, y), z)
and
xR (x, y · z) = xR (xR (x, y), z)

and similar identities assure the last property of R. Here the multiplication is taken in G∗ . All these
identities are easy to check.
Now let us describe the structure of a G∗ -category explicitly. Define the G∗ structure on D(G) as
π((ε1 , x1 ), . . . , (εn , xn )) = ε1 (x1 ) · · · εn (xn )
−1 −1
Here the product is taken in G∗ , x · y = x+ y+ y−
x− , and ε(x) is defined in (4).

The monoidal structure is the same as for the category of diagrams. The tensor product of objects is
{(ε1 , x1 ), . . . , (εn , xn )} ⊗ {(σ1 , y1 ), . . . , (σm , ym )} = {(ε1 , x1 ), . . . , (εn , xn ), (σ1 , y1 ), . . . , (σm , ym )}
The tensor product of morphisms is shown on Fig. 16. The identity object is the empty set.

The proof of this proposition and the definition of elementary diagrams are the same as for the category
of framed tangles (see [T1]).
3.4. The category of C-diagrams. Let C be a braided G-category.
Definition 2. A pair (D, a) where D is a diagram and a : E(D) → Ob(C) is called a C-diagram if at
each double point the values of the map a on adjacent edges satisfy the following conditions (the edges are
enumerated as in Fig. 7):
• If a double point is positive, Xa = XL (Xc , Xd ), Xb = XR (Xc , Xd ).
• If the double point is negative, Xc = XL (Xa , Xb ), Xd = XR (Xa , Xb ).
If G is factorizable and R is given by (3), then it is clear that each C-diagram defines a G-colored diagram
defined by the composition map π ◦ a : E(D) → G.
Now let us define the category D(C) of C-diagrams.
Objects of D(C) are finite sequences {(ε1 , X1 ), . . . , (εn , Xn )}, where εi = ± and Xi ∈ Ob(C).
Morphisms from {(ε1 , X1 ), . . . , (εn , Xn )} to {(σ1 , Y1 ), . . . , (σm , Ym )} are framed C-diagrams (D, a) with
σi

to right i = 1, . . . , m, and e−
i are edges adjacent to the lower boundary, with i = 1, . . . , n.
The identity morphism of (ε1 , X1 ), . . . , (εn , Xn ) is the trivial braid with the orientation of components
defined by εi and with Xi ∈ Ob(C) assigned to i-th strand.
The following theorem is a generalization of Theorem 1 about G-colored diagrams.

Theorem 2. The category D(C) is a ribbon G-category.
The proof is parallel to the one of the theorem 1.
4. Invariants of framed G-tangles
4.1. The functor Φ : D(C) → C. As in the case of framed tangles and tangled framed graphs the first step
in the construction of invariants of G-tangles will be the construction of a rigid G-braided monoidal functor
from the category of C-diagrams to the category C.
Let C be a ribbon G-category.
Theorem 3. There exists a unique covariant functor Φ : D(C) → C such that
• Φ({(ε1 , X1 ), . . . (εn , Xn )}) = X1ε1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Xnεn , where X + = X, X − = X ∗ .
• Φ is a monoidal functor, i.e.
Φ((D1 , a1 ) ⊗ (D2 , a2 )) = Φ((D1 , a1 )) ⊗ Φ((D2 , a2 ))
where (Di , ai ) are C-diagrams.
• Values of Φ on elementary diagrams are:
(1) If I ε : (ε, X) → (ε, X) is the identity morphism then
Φ(I ε ) = idX ǫ .
(2) For morphism er,l
X : (±, X) ⊗ (∓, X) → 1 we have:
Φ(erX ) = eX ∗ ◦ (µX ⊗ id) : X ⊗ X ∗ → X ∗∗ ⊗ X ∗ → 11 ,
Φ(elX ) = eX : X ∗ ⊗ X → 11
(3) For ir,l : 11 → (∓, X) ⊗ (±, X) we have
∗
Φ(irX ) = (µ−1
X ⊗ id) ◦ iX ∗ : 11 → X ⊗ X

Φ(ilX ) = iX : 11 → X ∗ ⊗ X,
(4) If c : (+, X) ⊗ (+, Y ) → (+, XL (X, Y )) ⊗ (+, XR (X, Y )) is the braiding morphism,
Φ(c) = cX,Y : X ⊗ Y → XL ⊗ XR .
(5) For the inverse morphism c−1 : (+, XL ) ⊗ (+, XR ) → (+, X) ⊗ (+, Y ) we have:
Φ(c−1 ) = (cX,Y )−1 : XL ⊗ XR → X ⊗ Y .
• This functor Φ is rigid monoidal and G-braided.
The proof of this theorem is completely parallel to the corresponding theorem describing invariants of
framed tangles.

4.2. Invariants of framed G-tangles. Let C be a ribbon G-category and A = {Ax }x∈G be a family of
objects such that π(Ax ) = x. In other words A is a section of π : C → G. Assume that objects from this
family have the following property:
B : (Ax , Ay ) → (AxL (x,y) , AxR (x,y) )
This implies that the braiding morphisms act as:
cAx ,Ay : Ax ⊗ Ay → AxL (x,y) ⊗ AxR (x,y)
It also implies that
∗

cAx ,Ay : A∗x ⊗ Ay → AxR (y,x1 ) ⊗ A∗x1
where x1 ∈ G is such that x = xL (y, x1 ). This can be derived from the previous formula and from the axioms
for the evaluation and injection morphisms. The action of the braiding on other duals can be computed
similarly.
Now, let us fix such family of objects in C to define a C-coloring of D for a given G-coloring c of the
diagram D. We construct invariants of G-tangles as follows:
• given a G-tangle (t, ρ) define the G-colored diagram [(D, c)] as in section 2 using the equivalence of
categories of G-tangles and G-diagrams.
• given a G-colored diagram [(D, c)] define a C-diagram [(D, a)] as above.
• apply the functor Φ to the C-diagram [(D, a)].
It is clear, from the definition of every step here, that the composition map is an invariant of (t, ρ) with
values in morphisms of the category C.
In the following section we will describe a GL2 (C)-category associated with the quantized universal enveloping algebra of gl2 (C).
5. Quantized universal enveloping algebra of gl2
5.1. The algebra Uh (gl2 ). The algebra Uh (gl2 ) over the ring C[[h]] is generated by elements H, G, X, and
Y with defining relations
[H, G] = 0, [H, X] = 2X, [H, Y ] = −2Y,
[G, X] = 2X, [G, Y ] = −2Y,

The algebra Uh (gl2 ) is the Drinfeld double of the quantized universal enveloping algebra Uh (b) ⊂ Uh (sl2 )
where b is a Borel subalgebra in sl2 . As the double of a Hopf algebra it is quasitriangular with the universal
R-matrix

This is the element of Uh (gl2 )⊗2 which one should consider as a formal power series in h.
Since R is the universal R-matrix it satisfies the following identities:
R∆(a)R−1 = σ · ∆(a)

(8)

(∆ ⊗ id)(R) = R13 R23
(id ⊗ ∆)(R) = R13 R12
where σ is the permutation operator σ(a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a. In particular, R satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation
R12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12
5.2. The inner automorphism R. Define the inner automorphism
R : Uh (gl2 )⊗2 [[h]] → Uh (gl2 )⊗2 [[h]] as
R(x ⊗ y) = R(x ⊗ y)R−1

It is easy to compute the action of R on generators.

6. The algebra U
The algebra U is generated over C[t, t−1 ] by elements K, L, E and F with the following defining relations
KL = LK, KE = t2 EK, KF = t−2 F K,
LE = t2 EL, LF = t−2 F L,
EF − F E = (t − t−1 )(K − L−1 )
The center of U is generated freely by Laurent polynomials in KL−1 and
c = EF + Kt−1 + L−1 t

(10)
This is a Hopf algebra with

∆(K) = K ⊗ K, ∆(L) = L ⊗ L,
∆(E) = E ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ E, ∆(F ) = F ⊗ 1 + L−1 ⊗ F .

φ(E) = (e 2 − e− 2 )X, φ(F ) = (e 2 − e− 2 )Y
extends to a homomorphism of Hopf algebras.
The algebra U is not quasitriangular. Instead, there is an outer automorphism of the division ring U¯⊗2
of U ⊗2 which we denote by the same letter R as the automorphism (9) which acts on generators as
R(1 ⊗ K) = (1 ⊗ K)(1 + tK −1 E ⊗ F L)−1
R(1 ⊗ L) = (1 ⊗ L)(1 + tK −1 E ⊗ F L)−1
R(E ⊗ 1) = E ⊗ L
R(1 ⊗ F ) = K −1 ⊗ F
Define its action on generators K ⊗ 1, L ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ E, and F ⊗ 1 such that
R(∆(a)) = σ ◦ ∆(a)
where a is one of the generators of U.
It is clear that the homomorphism φ brings the outer automorphism R to (9).

7. The algebra Uε
Let ε be a primitive root of 1 of an odd degree ℓ. Denote by Uε the specialization of U to t = ε. The
following theorem is a version of the corresponding facts for simple Lie algebras proved in [DC-K].
Theorem 5.

• Elements E ℓ , F ℓ , K ±ℓ , and L±ℓ generate a central subalgebra Z0 ⊂ Uε .

• Z0 is a Hopf subalgebra with
∆(K ℓ ) = K ℓ ⊗ K ℓ , ∆(Lℓ ) = Lℓ ⊗ Lℓ ,
∆(E ℓ ) = E ℓ ⊗ K ℓ + 1 ⊗ E ℓ , ∆(F ℓ ) = F ℓ ⊗ 1 + L−ℓ ⊗ F ℓ .
• The algebra Uε is a free Z0 -module of dimension ℓ4 .
• The center Z(Uε ) is generated by Z0 and by the element (10) modulo the relation
ℓ−1

(c − Kεj+1 − L−1 ε−j−1 ) = E ℓ F ℓ
j=0

• Let α, β, a and b be coordinates on the group B+ × B− such that for b± ∈ B± we have:
b+ =

1 β
0 α

, b− =

a
b

0
1

Then the map F ℓ → ba−1 , E ℓ → β, K ℓ → α, Lℓ → a is a homomorphism of Hopf algebras
Z0 → C(B+ × B− )
• Uε is semisimple over a Zariski open subvariety of Spec(Z0 ) ≃ B+ × B− .
Let x ∈ GL∗2 be an irreducible Z0 -character and Ix ⊂ Uε be the corresponding ideal. The quotient algebra
Ax = Uε /Ix
is finite-dimensional of dimension ℓ4 . There are three natural structures of a left module on Ax . For a ∈ Uε
denote by [a] the class of a in Ax . Then these three actions are:
• π(a)[b] = [ab],
• φ(a)[b] = [bS(a)],
• ψ(a)[b] = [bS −1 (a)].
Assume that x ∈ GL∗2 is generic, i.e. that Ax is semisimple. Fix an isomorphism of algebras φx : Ax ≃
⊕ni=1 M at(ki ). For the algebra Uε it is known [DC-K] that n = ℓ2 and ki = ℓ for all i = 1, . . . , n. Define
n

ti T r(φix (a))

t : Ax → C, t(a) =
i=1

where T r is the matrix trace in M at(ki ) and

φix

: Ax → M at(ki ) is the i-th component of φx . It is clear

that t(a) does not depend on a particular choice of φx . Indeed, any other such isomorphism differs from
φx by an inner automorphism of ⊕ni=1 M at(ki ). Since trace is cyclically invariant, the value of t(a) for such
isomorphism will be the same as for φx . Thus, for generic x, we have an invariant bilinear form on Ax :
(a, b) = t(ab).

24

R. KASHAEV AND N. RESHETIKHIN

It is a scalar product if ti = 0 for each i = 1, . . . , n.
Fix a scalar product on Ax as above. This gives an isomorphism of vector spaces A∗x ≃ Ax . It is easy to
verify that the pairing between Uε -modules (Ax , φ) and (Ax , π) given by the map
ex : (Ax , φ) ⊗ (Ax , π) → C

(11)

acting as a ⊗ b → t(ab) is Uε -invariant with respect to the diagonal action. Indeed, using Sweedler’s notation
∆(c) =

c

c(1) ⊗ c(2) for the comultiplication of element c, we have:
aS(c(1) ) ⊗ c(2) b) =

εx (
c

t(aS(c(1) )c(2) b) = ε(c)t(ab)
c

Similarly
c(1) a ⊗ bS −1 (c(2) )) =

ex (
c

t(c(1) abS −1 (c(2) )) = ε(c)t(ab)
c

Therefore the map ex : (Ax , π) ⊗ (Ax , ψ) → C defined as in (11) is also Uε -invariant.
Let linear mapping ix : C → Ax ⊗ Ax be defined by the formula
ei ⊗ ei ,

ix (1) →
i

{ei } is a linear basis of Ax and {ei } the corresponding dual basis. It is easy to see that it is a morphism of
Uε -modules C → (Ax , π) ⊗ (Ax , φ) and C → (Ax , ψ) ⊗ (Ax , π). Indeed, let aji = t(aei ej ) for any a ∈ Ax , then
(a(1) )ji ej ⊗ ei (S(a(2) )) =

a(1) ei ⊗ ei S(a(2) ) =
a

i

a

ej ⊗ ej a(1) S(a(2) ) = ε(a)
a

i,j

j

ei ⊗ ei
i

which implies the first statement and the second statement can be proved similarly.
Thus, for the object (Ax , π) we have the left dual (Ax , φ) (and the right dual (Ax , ψ)).
Theorem 6. The subspace Z0 ⊗ Z0 ⊂ Uε ⊗ Uε is invariant with respect to the action of the automorphism
R.
Proof. From the action of R on generators of Uε and from the relations between generators we have:
R(1 ⊗ K ℓ ) = (1 ⊗ K ℓ )(1 + K −ℓ E ℓ ⊗ F ℓ Lℓ )−1
R(1 ⊗ Lℓ ) = (1 ⊗ Lℓ )(1 + K −ℓ E ℓ ⊗ F ℓ Lℓ )−1
R(E ℓ ⊗ 1) = E ℓ ⊗ Lℓ
R(1 ⊗ F ℓ ) = K −ℓ ⊗ F ℓ .
The comultiplication acts on ℓ-th powers of generators as:
∆(K ℓ ) = K ℓ ⊗ K ℓ , ∆(Lℓ ) = Lℓ ⊗ Lℓ
∆(E ℓ ) = E ℓ ⊗ K ℓ + 1 ⊗ E ℓ
∆(F ℓ ) = F ℓ ⊗ 1 + L−ℓ ⊗ F ℓ .
These formulae and the defining property R(∆(a)) = σ ◦ ∆(a) describe the action of R on generators of
Z0 ⊗ Z0 . In particular, it is clear that the image is in Z0 ⊗ Z0 .

INVARIANTS OF TANGLES WITH FLAT CONNECTIONS

25

Comparing the action of R on generators of Z0 ⊗ Z0 with the identification of Z0 and C(GL∗2 ) we have
the following statement.
Theorem 7. The automorphism R is the pull-back of the mapping b : GL∗2 × GL2∗ → GL∗2 × GL∗2 acting as
follows. First, identify GL∗2 with the Zariski open subvariety in GL2 via the factorization mapping. Then
the mapping b acts as
(x, y) → (xL (x, y), xR (x, y))
where xL (x, y) =

x− yx−1
−

and xR (x, y) = (xL (x, y))−1
+ x(xL (x, y))+ .

Let Ix be the ideal in Uε with the Z0 character x ∈ GL2∗ . From now on we will consider only generic
points x and therefore we can identify GL2 with GL∗2 . The two theorems have an important corollary. The
mapping R acts as:
R(Ix ⊗ Iy ) ⊂ IxR (x,y) ⊗ IxL (x,y)
This implies that the mapping R induces the isomorphism of algebras:
R(x, y) : Ax ⊗ Ay → AxR (x,y) ⊗ AxL (x,y)
This mapping is also an isomorphism of the tensor product of left Uε -modules (Ax , π).
Finally, consider the category of Uε -modules generated by tensor products of (Ax , π) and their duals. It is
clear that this category is a braided rigid monomial G-category with G = GL2∗ and with the braiding given
by the composition σ ◦ R.
8. Conclusion
In this paper we have constructed invariants of tangles with flat connections in their complements. An
example of such construction is described for GL2 (C). This is rather simple example related to quantum
invariant constructed in [Ka]. More interesting examples related to irreducible representations of quantized
universal enveloping algebras of simple Lie algebras will be analyzed in a separate paper.
The complement of a tangle is a rather special 3-manifold. The construction of invariants of 3-manifolds
with G-flat connections in them for any simple Lie group G is the next step. The case of G = P SL2 (C) was
studied in [BB].
An interesting, but somewhat speculative question: how to relate the constructed invariants to a topological quantum field theory defined “phenomenologically” in terms of functional integrals. We expect that
this theory will be Chern–Simons theory with complex simple G. The corresponding boundary conformal
field theory should be complex Wess–Zumino–Witten theory on a surface with boundary with boundary
operators ”parametrized” by elements of G.
