introduct
a gelfanddorfman bialgebra is a vector space with a lie algebra structur and a novikov
algebra structur satisfi a certain compat condit thi bialgebra structur
correspond to a certain hamiltonian pair in the gelfanddikiidorfman theori of hamiltonian oper cf gdi gdo in thi talk i will give a survey on the studi of
gelfanddorfman bialgebra first let me give a more technic initi introduct to the
bialgebra through what i call lie algebra with onevari structur
let f be an arbitrari field denot by z the ring of integ and by n the addit
semigroup of nonneg integ all the vector space are assum over f let v be a
vector space and let t be an indetermin form a tensor
v v f ft t1

u tn z n1
12
we denot

for u v

where z is a formal variabl a lie algebra with onevari structur is a vector space v
with the lie bracket of the form

13
for u v v where m n are nonneg integ depend on u v and wij v here we
have use the notat

moreov each wij depend on u and v bilinearli by 12 and 13 abov definit is
not in gener form we aim at give the audienc a simpl rough pictur accord
to wightman axiom of quantum field theori the algebra content of twodimension
quantum field theori is a certain represent theori of lie algebra with onevari
structur eg cf k where intertwin oper among irreduc modul partit
function charact in algebra term and correl function relat to 13 etc
play import role
suppos that m n 0 in 13 we denot
w00 u v
15
then v u v form a lie algebra and v is the correspond loop algebra with the lie
bracket
u tj v tk u v tjk
for u v v j k z
16
if v fe is onedimension and

then v is the centerless virasoro algebra or a rankon witt algebra with the lie bracket

then v is an algebra satisfi
for u v w v the abov algebra v appear in gelfand and dorfman work gdo
correspond to certain hamiltonian oper moreov it also appear in balinskii and
novikov work bn as the local structur of certain poisson bracket of hydrodynam type
thi structur wa first abstractli studi by zelmanov z filippov f and wa name as
novikov algebra by osborn o1
note that 112 is the axiom of leftsymmetr algebra leftsymmetr algebra play
fundament role in the theori of affin manifold cf a fd novikov algebra are
leftsymmetr algebra whose right multipl oper are mutual commut cf
111 furthermor

then v form a lie algebra v form a novikov algebra and the follow compat condit hold

for u v w v
i call the tripl v a gelfanddorfman bialgebra cf x4 which correspond
to a certain hamiltonian pair in gelfand and dorfman work gdo moreov 113 hold
the lie bracket on v is

the articl is organ as follow in section 2 i will talk about structur of simpl
novikov algebra and their irreduc represent in section 3 i will present some gener construct of gelfanddorfman bialgebra in section 4 i will give a few classif
result on the bialgebra in section 5 exampl of applic to simpl cubic conform
algebra and quartic conform algebra will be given

novikov algebra
let us first give a construct of novikov algebra let a be a commut associ
algebra then a form a novikov algebra which is not so interest take a deriv
of a and a we defin
u v uv uv
for u v a
21
then a form a novikov algebra the abov construct wa found by s gelfand
when 0 cf gdo by fillip f when f and by me x2 in gener case
theorem 21 zelmanov z ani finitedimension simpl novikov algebra over an
algebra close field f with characterist 0 isomorph to f
base on osborn work o1 i obtain the follow result
theorem 22 xu x1 a finitedimension simpl novikov algebra over an algebra close field f with characterist p 2 is either onedimension with a base
element e such that e e e or ha dimens pk for some posit integ k with a basi
j j 1 pk 2 satisfi
j1 j2 j1 jj22 1 j1 j2 j1 1 j2 0 apk 2 j1 1 j2 1 bpk 2
22
for j1 j2 1 pk 1 where a b f are constant
next we consid infinitedimension simpl novikov algebra with char f 0 let be
an addit subgroup of f and let f1 be an extens field of f take a map f
f
1 f1 0 such that
f f f f f f
23
for take j to be the addit semigroup 0 or n let a f j be a vector
space over f1 with a basi
ui i n
24
we defin an algebra oper on a f j by
ui uj f uij
for i j j
25
then a f j form a commut associ algebra over f1 and also over f we
defin a deriv of a f j over f1 by
ui ui iui1
for i j
26
where we treat
uj 0
if j j
27
note that is also a deriv of a f j over f
theorem 23 xu x2 for ani element a f j the novikov algebra
a f j cf 21 is simpl
osborn o3 gave a classif of infinitedimension simpl novikov algebra with an
element e such that ee fe assum the exist of generalizedeigenspac decomposit
with respect to it left multipl oper there are four fundamant mistak in
hi classif the first is use of proposit 26 d in o1 with 0 which wa
misprov the second is that the eigenspac a0 in lemma 212 of o3 doe not form a
field when b 0 with respect to the novikov algebra oper the third is that a0 may
not be a perfect field when b 0 the fourth is that the author forgot the case b 0 and
0 in lemma 28 in addit to these four mistak there are gap in the argument of
classif in o3 it seem that one can not draw ani conclus of classif base
on the argument in o3
a linear transform t of a vector space v is call local finit if the subspac
ft m v is finitedimension for ani v v
28
m0
an element u of a novikov algebra n is call left local finit if it left multipl
oper lu is local finit
i have reestablish the follow classif theorem
theorem 24 xu x6 let n be an infinitedimension simpl novikov algebra
over an algebra field f with characterist 0 suppos that n contain a left local finit
element e whose right multipl re is a constant map and left multipl is surject
if re 0 then there exist an addit subgroup of f an extens field f1 of f a map
f f
1 satisfi 23 and f such that the algebra n is isomorph to
a f j
now we consid represent of a novikov algebra a modul m of a novikov algebra
n is a vector space with two linear map
n m m u w u w m n m w u w u
29
such that 111 and 112 hold when one of the element in u v w is in m and the other
two are in n the commut algebra associ with a finitedimension simpl novikov
algebra over an algebra close field f with characterist p 2 is a rankon simpl lie
algebra of witt type cf o1 whose finitedimension irreduc modul ha not been
complet classifi yet howev we have the follow complet result
theorem 25 xu x1 suppos that f is an algebra close field with characterist p 2 if m is a finitedimension irreduc modul of a finitedimension simpl
novikov algebra n in the present 22 then there exist a constant and a basi
vj j 1 pk 2 of m such that
2 1

j1
211
for j1 j2 1 pk 2 moreov 0 if a 0 convers 210 and 211 defin an
irreduc modul for ani 0 f and for 0 if a 0
let us go to the case of char f 0 first we shall give a construct of irreduc
modul take j to be the addit semigroup 0 or n let a be a vector space with a
basi
ui f i j
212
defin the oper on a by
ui uj uij
for f i j j
213
then a form a commut associ algebra with the ident element 1 u00
we defin the deriv on a by 26 let be an addit subgroup of f such that
j 0 set
n
fui
214
ij
for ani fix element n we defin the oper on a by
u v u v u v
for u v a
215
by theorem 23 a form a simpl novikov algebra and n form a simpl subalgebra
of a for f we set
m
fui
216
ij
express 215 show
n m m n m
217
thu m form an n modul by the proof of theorem 29 in x2 we have
theorem 26 xu x6 the n modul m is irreduc
a natur question is to what extent the modul m f cover the irreduc
modul of n up to thi point we are not be abl to answer thi for a gener element
n for an n modul m we defin the left action lm u00 of u00 by
lm u00 w u00 w
for w m
218
theorem 27 xu x6 if f then ani irreduc n modul m with local finit
lm u00 is isomorph to m for some f when f is algebra close
