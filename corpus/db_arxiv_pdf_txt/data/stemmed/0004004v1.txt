the studi of mathemat softwar
the field of mathemat softwar is concern with the scienc and engin of solv mathemat problem with comput the primari focu is
the develop of generalpurpos softwar tool applic to problem in a
varieti of disciplin there are a larg number of facet to thi work includ
the follow
the develop and analysi of algorithm for standard mathemat
problem which occur in a wide varieti of applic
the practic implement of mathemat algorithm on comput

softwar design for mathemat comput system includ user interfac
test and evalu of mathemat softwar includ methodolog
tool testb and studi of particular system
issu relat to the dissemin and mainten of mathemat softwar
in 1977 john rice aptli character the need for special studi in thi
area with the follow observ 66
mani sophist scientist produc naiv softwar just as mani
sophist comput programm produc naiv scienc
tremend progress ha been made in the mathemat softwar field in the
past 25 year yet there continu to be a wide rang of qualiti in exist
softwar in both the research and commerci domain good mathemat
softwar result from the applic of certain principl methodolog and
practic deriv from both appli mathemat and comput scienc the
studi of these principl and practic is central to the field of mathemat
softwar to thi end typic softwar engin practic while benefici
to the product of mathemat softwar system are not suffici mathemat softwar oper in the milieu of scientif comput which ha a
number of characterist that distinguish it from other area among these are
the follow
floatingpoint arithmet most scientif comput are perform
with floatingpoint arithmet consequ round error occur in
most arithmet oper mathemat algorithm therefor must
not onli be correct in a strict mathemat sens but they must control
the accumul of roundoff avoid catastroph loss of signific from
the subtract of like quantiti and avoid unnecessari overflow and
underflow such problem are sometim unavoid softwar system
must be design so that they do not fail when these anomali do occur
approxim floatingpoint arithmet certainli impli approxim at a veri fine level howev more substanti approxim
occur in mathemat comput infinit seri are truncat difficulttocomput function are approxim by polynomi deriv are
approxim by differ integr are approxim by finit sum
curv domain are approxim by polygon one the combin effect
of such approxim on the final result can be quit difficult to assess
analysi must be use to show that the correct solut is obtain as the
approxim are made more precis ie that the algorithm is converg howev good softwar must do more it must provid mechan
for a user to assess the qualiti of the result and to alert the user when
the result is suspect well engin softwar can use such metric to
2
automat control the level of approxim optim adapt the
algorithm to the situat at hand
infinit process mani mathemat comput consist of appli some infinit process that obtain the desir result onli in the limit
such process must be truncat for practic use consider research
effort have been involv in find iter that converg quickli decid when to stop is alway a difficult problem of practic concern to
softwar develop good softwar must employ techniqu that detect
diverg or too slow converg and take appropri action
coupl with these fundament mathemat challeng are practic concern about portabl how can develop produc softwar with reliabl
reproduc behavior when it must run in veri differ environ with
differ type of processor architectur arithmet system memori hierarchi oper system and languag processor such question are critic
in the studi of mathemat softwar

the contribut of john r rice
at thi confer we are celebr john rice long and influenti research
career john ha made fundament contribut to the area of approxim
theori numer analysi mathemat softwar and comput scienc in
the area of mathemat softwar hi technic contribut have had three
overrid theme
1 architectur of scientif softwar system john ha particip in
the design and develop of a varieti of wide distribut mathemat softwar system 37 38 58 64 68 70 in the cours of thi work
he pioneer a number of design concept which have influenc mani
system among these are polyalgorithm 59 metaalgorithm 61 and
softwar part 72
2 rais the level of abstract softwar user are more effici
when they can express their comput need in the languag of their
technic field for appli mathemat abstract are base upon
concept of the calculu not simpl arithmet oper encapsul
in program languag like fortran john rice work in highlevel
compon and languag 70 72 intellig interfac 40 41 42 and
problemsolv environ 29 56 have serv to push abstract to
higher and higher level
3 understand softwar via experiment understand the
behavior of softwar is necessari in order to make practic decis regard algorithm select 62 john ha often stress the import
of the use of experiment in such evalu the mani small engin decis made in the cours of translat an abstract algorithm
3
into a work comput program can have an enorm impact on it
perform characterist john ha devot much time to develop
test and evalu methodolog 7 43 57 65 80 and appli it to
particular situat 24 23 36 67 inde one of the principl applic of the ellpack system 70 and it successor ha been to the
perform evalu of softwar for partial differenti equat
john contribut to the field of mathemat softwar have been volumin and farreach in thi paper i have onli cite a few exampl of hi
mani write on thi subject in the remaind of thi paper i will enumer
some of the major event in math softwar point out some of john key
contribut along the way i will then describ sever current issu face
the field and make sever hazi predict of the futur

mathemat softwar past
begin
the earliest applic of electron comput were in scienc and engin
for which mathemat comput play a central role program wa
a veri difficult chore done without modern aid like highlevel languag compil and debugg the first public of a piec of mathemat softwar
in a research journal probabl occur in 1949 when mathemat tabl and
other aid to comput print a univac code for the solut of laplac
equat written in machin languag 76 such code were veri difficult to produc and the need for reus of softwar wa recogn veri earli on in 1951
wilk wheeler and gill present one of the earliest program librari which
wa develop for the edsac1 82
by the 1960 the introduct of highlevel program languag eg
algol and fortran had greatli eas the task of produc reusabl mathemat softwar the use of such languag wa not without controversi of cours
compil code wa not quit as effici as handtun assembl code but most
peopl were will to accept thi in light of the great save in programm
time also the subprogram structur provid by these languag provid a
simpl framework for the construct and mainten of librari of util
in 1960 the associ for comput machineri acm began a new
editori depart in the commun of the acm cacm devot to
the publish of algorithm edit by j h wegstein of the nation bureau of
standard nb thi section print the code of contribut algol procedur
most such code were quit short also remark on and certif of
previous publish code were solicit the first such contribut wa a
code for numer quadratur submit by r j herbold of nb 35 each
1 the edsac electron delay storag automat comput wa built in the late 1940
at the mathemat laboratori of the univers of cambridg it wa oper from 1949
until 1958
4
algorithm wa given a number and the set of algorithm later becam known
as the collect algorithm of the acm calgo
comput manufactur also began to develop librari for their user the
most promin of these wa probabl the ibm scientif softwar packag
ssp a number of laboratori such as bell lab boe harwel and monsanto began the develop of math softwar librari for their intern use
sever organ such as share the ibm user group began to collect
such util for redistribut
of cours subroutin librari were not the onli focu of research in thi
new field some were imagin way in which these new power comput
could be use to transform the way in which appli mathemat wa practic
mani of these idea were discuss at the symposium on interact system for
experiment appli mathemat held in in washington dc in august 1967
46 the vision there is remark clear mani of the particip report
on develop in technolog which would onli final begin to be realiz
in the 1980 and 1990 at purdu for exampl john rice saul rosen and
colleagu design napss numer analysi problemsolv system an
interact mathemat problemsolv system which would accept input akin
to normal mathemat notat 71 and would employ a varieti of heurist
to autom numer analysi unfortun the resourc necessari for such
an ambiti system exceed even the supercomput of the day like the cdc
6400 and a fulli function system wa never realiz
22
a commun emerg
perhap the first event that provid a real sens of commun for research
interest in the product and dissemin of reusabl mathemat softwar wa the mathemat softwar symposium held at purdu univers in
april 1970 john rice organ the symposium2 which wa sponsor by
acm and the offic of naval research and the proceed were publish as
a book by academ press 60 includ in the proceed were 23 paper
four descript of select mathemat softwar and more than 40 page of
introductori materi prepar by rice
one of the recommend from the symposium wa for the establish
of a journal that would publish paper relat to mathemat softwar john
rice vigor pursu thi possibility3 after consider negoti with
acm and the societi for industri and appli mathemat siam acm
agre to publish the new journal paper from an nsfsponsor confer
were use to provid articl to seed the journal mathemat softwar ii
wa held at purdu in may 1974 there were 225 attende with 82 paper
present the best of those paper make up the major of the first volum
of the acm transact on mathemat softwar tom which publish
2 the organ committe includ robert ashenhurst charl lawson m stuart lynn
and joseph traub
3 a committe that includ wayn cowel lloyd fosdick tom hull m stuart lynn and
joseph traub work with him
5
it first issu in 1975 with john rice as editorinchief john continu in that
posit until 1993
tom wa charter not onli to publish tradit research paper but
also algorithm with includ code which would be refere certif
translat and remark on previous publish algorithm the algorithm
section of cacm wa move to tom and henc tom algorithm were
number begin at 493 one of the import featur of the new journal
wa the establish of a reliabl algorithm distribut servic for calgo
the distribut on magnet tape wa perform on a costrecoveri basi by
imsl inc obtain softwar in machineread form wa much more use
than read code on paper thi also allow tom to adopt the polici of
not print the code of algorithm in the page of it journal thu save much
in product cost
a third confer organ by john rice mathemat softwar iii wa
held at univers of wisconsin in 1977 63 by the end of the decad mathemat softwar had emerg as a viabl research area with an activ commun
to support it after publish 25 volum tom remain a vibrant outlet for
the work of thi commun 79
23
softwar emerg
anoth import activ in the 1970 were the numer effort to develop
care construct systemat collect of mathemat softwar one of
the first of these wa the nat project the nation activ to test softwar
which wa conceiv in 1970 a joint ventur of argonn nation laboratori
stanford univers and the univers of texa at austin nat wa design
to studi problem in produc certifi distribut and maintain qualiti
numer softwar a key part of thi effort wa the product of two fortran
softwar packag eispack 30 75 for eigenvalu problem and funpack
13 for special function
eispack which first appear in 1972 wa base upon algorithm publish in the 1960 in numerisch mathematik and later collect by wilkinson
and reinsch in the handbook for automat comput 83 although the
core of eispack wa larg a fortran translat of these exist algol code
the project wa enorm influenti it set a new standard for qualiti transport mathemat softwar rigor test in a wide varieti of comput
environ it success inspir the develop of mani systemat collect or pack in other area linpack for linear system 19 fishpak
for separ ellipt problem 77 deboor bspline interpol packag 17
minpack for nonlinear system 50 depac for ordinari differenti equat 74 fullerton function librari fnlib 28 swarztraub fftpack
for fast fourier transform 78 and quadpack for numer quadratur 53
of all the earli pack linpack undoubt saw the most widespread
use one of the key to linpack success wa the decis to base it code
on the newli propos basic linear algebra subprogram bla 47 the
bla perform elementari vector oper such as norm dot product
6
scale and vector sum the innermost loop in linpack columnori
algorithm occur insid the bla thi allow optim of the whole
packag by simpli optim the bla thi approach prove quit success
and mani machinespecif version of the bla were develop and support
by comput manufactur
the 1970 also saw great advanc in softwar for ordinari differenti equat ode gear code difsub 31 provid a well design framework
for automat integr of both stiff and nonstiff problem use linear multistep method shampin and gordon ode 73 did the same for rungekutta
method mani subsequ packag were built use these basic design other
influenti packag includ colsi for twopoint boundaryvalu problem
3 and dassl4 for differenti algebra system 52
a number of high qualiti multipurpos librari also had their start in the
1970 in 1970 six british comput center began an effort to develop a
librari for their icl 1906a comput the next year mark 1 of the nottingham algorithm group nag librari wa releas implement for
other system follow and in 1976 a notforprofit compani numer algorithm group ltd wa form to continu develop and distribut the
nag effort continu today 51 the first commerci math librari effort wa
also begun in 1970 with the incorpor in houston texa of imsl inc by
charl w johnson and edward battist by the time the compani show it
first profit in 1976 there were 430 librari subscrib the imsl librari remain
a viabl commerci product 44 bell laboratori also develop a librari
port whose singlesourc approach to portabl influenc mani subsequ
effort 26
the develop of ellpack a system for ellipt boundaryvalu problem also began in the mid 1970 thi effort which wa led by john rice wa
a cooper project of purdu univers the univers of texa at austin
yale univers and other in ellpack the solut process wa partit
into a number of distinct phase domain process discret index
linear system solut and output and the interfac between these phase
were care defin thi design allow the develop of a larg librari
of compon which could be easili compos to build algorithm for solv
particular problem ellpack also prove to be an excel testb for the
evalu of softwar for ellipt problem to eas the use of the system john
rice design a veryhighlevel languag to describ the problem to be solv
and to select the compon to be use to solv it the system first becam
fulli oper in 1978 70 mani of the basic concept in ellpack design
such as highlevel user interfac and plugandplay softwar part technolog
are in common use in modern problemsolv environ
the develop of mathemat softwar in the 1970 and earli 1980
is describ in detail in the book sourc and develop of mathemat

increas access
by the begin of the 1980 a substanti collect of mathemat softwar mostli in the form of fortran subprogram wa avail for use the
user base for thi softwar had grown substanti and with it came a new
problem how to locat that need softwar compon the nation bureau
of standard now nist develop an extens catalog of such softwar their
guid to avail mathemat softwar gam base upon a detail
treestructur problemori classif system 10 allow reader to
see which compon of which librari and packag both public domain and
commerci were avail to solv each problem the catalog remain avail
today as an onlin resourc 34
anoth barrier to the widespread use of softwar develop by the research
commun wa simpli the process of obtain the code one had to locat the
author request a magnet tape and attempt to deciph it format use
softwar wa often lost to the commun when an author chang institut
and there wa no longer support for distribut it in 1985 jack dongarra
then at argonn nation lab and eric gross at bell lab start a softwar
repositori they call netlib 20 which pioneer the use of comput network
in softwar distribut softwar could be obtain automat by return
email after send request to an address whose email wa process by a
unix daemon the readi avail of such softwar chang the way in which
mani research work mani more made routin use of high qualiti softwar
and mani other were freed of the necess of maintain their own privat
repositori now webaccess and support by the univers of tennesse
at knoxvil and bell lab with mirror worldwid netlib remain the premier
repositori of softwar develop by the mathemat softwar commun 11
the 1980 also saw the first commerci success for generalpurpos interact system for mathemat a system for matrix comput develop as
a teach aid dure the period 197784 by cleve moler at the univers of
new mexico wa commerci as a tool for control system engin today
matlab is a veri popular system for scientif comput 49 the overal
structur of modern interact mathemat system wa greatli influenc by
the system mathematica develop by stephen wolfram in 1988 84 mathematica wa the first commerci system to integr symbol numer and
graphic capabl into a singl packag the grow avail of person comput and workstat wa an import factor in the success of
these system with these tool the use of mathemat softwar wa begin to expand to those with littl experi in numer method or even
program
25
new architectur
the 1980 also brought vector and parallel comput into widespread use and
with them addit challeng to the design of mathemat softwar vector processor vendor develop special math librari tune for their sy
8
tem mainli contain softwar for linear system and fft these solut
emerg becaus the perform of linear algebra softwar such as linpack
wa disappoint on vector regist architectur like the cray and convex
the main reason for thi wa the fact that move data from memori to vector regist wa veri costli and that linpack columnori algorithm
base on the bla necessit more data movement than wa realli necessari
in 1984 john rice host a workshop at purdu parvec workshop number 4 in which a varieti of scheme for develop portabl highperform
softwar for vector parallel system were propos 69 jack dongarra and sven
hammarl propos the develop of new class of bla level 2 bla
for matrixvector oper and level 3 bla for matrixmatrix oper
encapsul on2 and on3 oper respect as fundament oper would provid much more opportun to optim core oper on differ processor these new bla 21 22 would provid the basi for a major
new linear algebra packag releas in 1992 lapack 2 which includ the
function of both eispack and linpack use blockori algorithm
in which the fundament oper were now matrix oper encapsul
in the level 3 bla these have proven to be highli effici on modern vector
processor and symmetr multiprocessor everi major comput manufactur now support tune bla for their system and incorpor lapack
in their math librari commun effort are current underway to extend the
bla in new direct such as spars matrix oper 6
in the late 1980 multiprocessor system of wide differ design were becom routin avail and with them a host of new program model
support by special messagepass primit develop portabl softwar for the class of distribut memori multipl instruct multipl data or
mimd system becam a new challeng the pvm system develop in 1991

one of the first portabl math softwar librari for distribut architectur
wa scalapack a distribut memori counterpart of lapack linear system
solver 5 thi packag becam the core of sever multipurpos distribut
memori math softwar librari which first appear in the 1990 among
these are the nag parallel librari 51 ibm pessl 14 and the european
pineapl effort 54
the increas complex of scientif softwar system be develop in
the 1990 led to an interest in new softwar architectur objectori approach to the develop of mathemat softwar began to be serious
consid the notori ineffici of pure objectori design and the
lack of languag standard made such pursuit difficult nevertheless approach that allow mani of the advantag of objectori design without
sacrif effici were develop lapack a subset of the linear sys9
tem solver in lapack written in c wa one of the first such success
packag 18 today objectori approach are routin use in scientif
comput
26
expand vision
by the 1990 rapidli increas comput power wa lead to new vision for
the futur of mathemat softwar system dure that period for exampl
john rice and colleagu led in the establish of a new commun of research interest in exploit the promis of expert system for numer
comput in a seri of confer held at purdu 40 41 42 the use of ai
approach for such task as algorithm select automat program and
process manag were explor
by thi time comput had becom an essenti ingredi in the practic of scienc and engin interest in comput scienc as a new field
of studi wa begin and interdisciplinari program for train it practition were be establish in mani univers john rice and other
began to develop a new vision for mathemat softwar system to support
comput scienc research these system call problemsolv environ 29 56 would provid natur graphic user interfac in which scientist
describ their problem use the vocabulari of their nativ disciplin they
would provid access to rich librari of problemsolv compon enabl
webbas parallel and distribut comput user would be abl to interact with ongo comput to easili visual result to manag a larg
databas of experiment result and to ask advic of expert advisori system
mani smallscal specialpurpos system now under develop and use can
be classifi as problemsolv environ and research group throughout
the world are work on infrastructur necessari for the routin construct

exampl of current work in networkbas scientif comput are netsolv
12 the neo optim server 16 and the comput grid 25
the vision of scientif comput in heterogen distribut environ place stringent requir on the portabl and interoper of
scientif softwar that are extrem difficult to achiev 4 such need have
spark interest in the use of common virtual environ such as java5 for
comput scienc and engin the java languag and it environ
the java virtual machin which ha becom avail on nearli everi comput platform provid a fix floatingpoint model thread remot execut
standard gui and other facil within a simpl objectori program

to develop matteo frigo and stephen johnson have taken a similar approach
in the comput of fast fourier transform 27 for fft hardwar also
interact with the prime factor of the sequenc length n to add further
complic fftw the fastest fourier transform in the west use heurist and experiment to develop a justintim strategi for fast comput
for a given n on a given processor6

mathemat softwar present
in thi section i point out a varieti of metaissu that face mathemat softwar research today
31
massmarket softwar
until recent mathemat softwar wa produc mostli by expert in numer analysi as a byproduct of their research in algorithm user of thi
softwar also were fairli sophist with some experi in numer algorithm develop themselv they had an appreci of the limit of
numer algorithm and the necess of care verif of result even
when use softwar develop by expert
today commun of mathemat softwar develop and user is much
larger and much more divers the great demand for mathemat comput ha made massmarket mathemat softwar profit commerci
support mathemat and statist softwar is now wide avail with
highlevel interfac that allow use by nonprogramm such user often do
6 fftw
won the 1999 wilkinson prize for numer softwar
11
not have the background necessari to recogn the differ between a difficult problem and a routin one the mathemat landscap is still litter
with pitfal and these user may be too trust of the result produc by the
scientif softwar system that they use programm who add mathemat
and statist capabl to commerci softwar system are no longer expert
in numer analysi they may be content to code up a formula from a book
without give thought to it numer properti the problem may be even
more sever in system that are not overtli mathemat in natur mathemat comput are increasingli be done in embed devic code
by programm whose mathemat sophist may be suspect
as a result in spite of tremend progress in numer method and softwar mani user of modern mathemat softwar are at risk there is now
a desper need for numer analyst to develop and appli methodolog
for the valid of mathemat and statist softwar techniqu tool
refer data and refer softwar are need to support critic evalu
of mathemat softwar by develop and user 8 unfortun there is
littl interest and support within the research commun for such activ
those softwar develop who seek advic regard numer softwar
product are like to look to popular sourc like numer recip 55
book like thi provid a reason good introduct to numer method
and the program they includ provid good exampl of the basic techniqu
program like these are often incorpor wholesal into applic in spite
of the fact that they are typic less effici robust and reliabl than stateoftheart mathemat softwar the mathemat softwar commun need
more popular who can bring the messag of good numer softwar design
to those in other field
32
tower of babel
for mani year there wa one languag for scientif comput fortran thi
greatli simplifi the develop and reus of mathemat softwar compon today we are face with a plethora of program languag in use
for scientif comput though offici obsolet fortran 77 is still the languag of mani good compil are now avail for fortran 90 and mani
have been extend to support fortran 95 the current fortran standard although their adopt by programm ha been slow in come the c languag ha proven much more popular for which excel compil are now
avail most gam user who cannot find the softwar they seek are look for c procedur c the objectori extens to c is the choic
for a grow number of new mathemat model project unfortun
c ha not until recent had an agreedto standard and as a result develop portabl softwar ha been difficult java the popular networkawar
objectori program languag develop by sun is be serious consid by mani although it perform and languag featur leav much
to be desir the fact that java is now be wide taught in univers insur it futur final mani softwar compon are be develop in the
12
veryhighlevel languag use in special system matlab is the primari
exampl
we are clearli face a transit in comput languag for scienc and engin comput numer analyst no longer have much influenc on the
choic of languag of those do numer comput languag choic are
more often made base on other consider such as the need for conveni
and portabl graphic user interfac visual tool and other critic
system servic while such servic are larg unavail to fortran programm wish to develop portabl system they are conveni at hand
in c c and java the increas portabl afford by the widespread
avail of java virtual machin on window unix and appl platform
ha made java a veri attract option while mixedlanguag program
is possibl and doe provid the abil to reus legaci fortran softwar thi
option is not popular among user it add complex to the softwar project
while make the code more difficult to transport
unfortun there is almost no support for the migrat of the exist
base of fortran mathemat softwar compon to other languag as a
result thi wellengin softwar is be increasingli bypass in favor of
inferior homegrown solut
33
the risk of selfpublish
the rise of the internet ha greatli eas the exchang of inform among research it is simpl and conveni for research group to develop a web page
to distribut softwar and document to potenti user while thi ha led
to increas access to research softwar it place the longterm mainten of
the output of the research commun in jeopardi project web page on department server are not perman fixtur nevertheless mani research
are use such facil in place of submit their softwar to more perman
archiv such as netlib or the collect algorithm of the acm there is a danger that much of the current avail expertis embed in such softwar
will be lost to futur research
4
mathemat softwar futur
in thi section i offer a few predict regard futur mathemat softwar
research and usag
predict within five year acm will ceas print public of tom
subscript to tom have been drop at the rate of about 5 percent per
year for some time other acm journal and inde most other mathemat
and comput scienc journal are experienc the same phenomenon one
of the reason for thi is the prolifer of special journal princip
develop by commerci publish
13
for some time acm ha been consid mechan for maintain their
public program as a viabl servic to the commun the solut to thi
problem is found in the acm digit librari acmdl which premier in 1998
1 the acmdl provid it subscrib with onlin access to all acm journal
articl and confer proceed publish sinc 1985 at a subscript fee
which is less than the cost of three print journal current thi account for
more than 350000 page of text accept of the acmdl by member and
subscrib ha been overwhelm provid acm with the additon revenu
to begin the work of extend the acmdl hold to includ all materi
publish by acm sinc it incept in 1947 at the same time the success of
the acmdl ha contribut to a further 25 percent drop in print subscript
in 1999 if present trend continu print version of acm journal will be
no longer be sustain in five year time instead they will be superced by
their electron counterpart
the acmdl will serv to blur the distinct between individu acm
journal the concept of a journal will be replac by that of an input stream
to the acmdl control by a certif author ie a board of editor
support by volunt refere in such an environ it will be much easier and much less financi riski for acm to initi new refere input
stream and to phase out those which have becom less product rather
than subscrib to individu journal acmdl subscrib will have access to
an individu tailor notif servic which will alert them to the avail of new articl in their area of interest
public in the acmdl will not be restrict to articl with a sever
page limit extend appendic will be easili accommod as will other
artifact such as softwar audio video etc
predict user will no longer instal mathemat softwar on their workstat
the need for instantan distribut and use of mathemat softwar
compon in heterogen network environ will put new pressur for
softwar portabl a key element of the solut will be standard virtual
environ in which softwar can execut java is an exampl of such an
environ it widespread avail also provid a new model for softwar
distribut complex conglomer of sourc code will no longer need to
be explicitli download and instal on the local system in advanc of their
use instead precompil bytecod for the virtual machin will be abl to
be download from site of develop or vendor on demand thi also provid a solut to the problem of distribut patch and updat to softwar
rather than purchas an entir librari softwar user will have the option of
subscrib to a servic pay onli for the portion of the librari that they
actual use
anoth new model for softwar reus in a network environ is base
on a remot execut paradigm in thi case problemsolv servic are
made avail to user over the network when a problem need be solv a
14
messag contain a highlevel specif of the problem is sent to the servic
provid who provid both the softwar and the execut cycl need to
solv it thi model is probabl more appropri for access to larg scale
system like finiteel model packag
predict the percentag of peopl directli use math softwar librari
will decreas
the wide avail of problemsolv environ pse for variou
domain will bring comput capabl to an even wider audienc than
today these user will make use of the servic of the pse bliss unawar
of the complex system involv softwar librari expert system and remot
execut which are be marshal on their behalf
howev if thi vision is to be realiz a new class of softwar design
must be train they must be wellvers in numer analysi mathemat
algorithm modern softwar design and highperform comput and commun addit research in mathemat softwar must be perform
to provid new method for improv the robust and adapt of mathemat softwar system and to address new problem area and final new
method for assess the correct and reliabl of complex mathemat
softwar system must be devis and deploy
mathemat softwar is still a vital and vibrant research area that will
increas in import in the come decad we are grate to john rice for
hi vision and leadership in get us here
