for an intermedi mass higg boson with smlike coupl the lhc
allow observ of a varieti of decay channel in product by gluon fusion and weak boson fusion cross section ratio provid measur of
variou ratio of higg coupl with accuraci of order 15 for 100 fb1
of data in each of the two lhc experi for higg mass abov
120 gev minim assumpt on the higg sector allow for an indirect
measur of the total higg boson width with an accuraci of 10 to
20 and of the h w w partial width with an accuraci of about 10

i introduct
investig of the symmetri break mechan of the electroweak su2 u1
gaug symmetri will be one of the prime task of the lhc correspondingli major
effort have been concentr on devis method for higg boson discoveri for the
mh 1 tev
entir mass rang allow within the standard model sm 100 gev
after lep2 and for higg boson search in extens of the sm like the mssm 12
while observ of one or more higg scalar at the lhc appear assur discoveri
will be follow by a more demand task the systemat investig of higg boson
properti beyond observ of the variou cp even and cp odd scalar which natur
may have in store for us thi mean the determin of the coupl of the higg
boson to the known fermion and gaug boson ie the measur of htt hbb h
and hw w hzz h coupl to the extent possibl
clearli thi task veri much depend on the expect higg boson mass for mh
200 gev and within the sm onli the h zz and h w w channel are expect
to be observ and the two gaug boson mode are relat by su2 abov mh
250 gev where detector effect will no longer domin the mass resolut of the
h zz 4 reson addit inform is expect from a direct measur
of the total higg boson width h a much richer spectrum of decay mode is predict
for the intermedi mass rang ie if a smlike higg boson ha a mass between the
110 gev and the zpair threshold the main reason for focus
reach of lep2
on thi rang are present indic from electroweak precis data which favor mh

the prospect of observ sever higg product and decay channel over the
entir intermedi mass rang suggest a reanalysi of coupl determin at the
lhc 5 in thi paper we attempt a first such analysi for the case where the branch fraction of an intermedi mass higg reson are fairli similar to the sm case
ie we analyz a smlike higg boson onli we make use of the previous publish
analys for the inclus higg product channel 12 and of the weak boson fusion
channel 610 the former were obtain by the experiment collabor and includ detail detector simul the latter are base on parton level result which
employ full qcd tree level matrix element for all signal and background process we
will not discuss here differ in the perform expect for the atla and cm
detector nor detail in the theoret assumpt which lead to differ estim for
expect signal and background rate the reader is refer to the origin public from which number are extract in section ii we summar expect for
the variou channel includ expect accuraci for cross section measur of the
variou signal for an integr luminos of 100 fb1 implic for the determin of coupl ratio and the measur of higg boson partial decay width are
then obtain in section iii a final summari is given in section iv
ii survey of intermedi mass higg channel
the variou higg channel list in eq 16 and their observ at the lhc
have all been discuss in the literatur where avail we give valu as present
quot by the experiment collabor in order to compar the accuraci with which
the cross section of differ higg product and decay channel can be measur we
need to unifi these result for exampl kfactor of uniti are assum throughout
our goal in thi section is to obtain reason estim for the rel error h h
which are expect after collect 100 fb1 in each the atla and the cm detector
ie we estim result after a total of 200 fb1 of data have been collect at the

of a 5 systemat background uncertainti appear optimist but attain it turn
out that with 30 fb1 alreadi the systemat error start to domin becaus the
background exce the signal rate by factor of up to 5 depend on the higg mass
run at high luminos make matter wors becaus the less effici reduct of
tt background due to less stringent bjet veto criteria increas the background rate
further becaus of thi problem we onli present result for 30 fb1 of low luminos

few signal event have lepton pair invari mass compat with z decay
therefor our estim are actual conserv note that the expect background

with which qq qqh bh w w can be measur a 10 systemat error
on the background doubl the error assum in the inclus case would degrad the
statist accuraci by typic a factor 12 or less as a result we expect that a veri

with a statist accuraci of order 5 or even better in the mass rang mh 140 gev
even for mh as low as 120 gev a 12 measur is expect
iii measur of higg properti
one would like to translat the cross section measur of the variou higg product and decay channel into measur of higg boson properti in particular
into measur of the variou higg boson coupl to gaug field and fermion
thi translat requir knowledg of nlo qcd correct to product cross section inform on the total higg decay width and a combin of the measur
discuss previous the task here is to find a strategi for combin the anticip
lhc data without undu loss of precis due to theoret uncertainti and systemat
error
for our further discuss it is conveni to rewrit all higg boson coupl in
term of partial width of variou higg boson decay channel the higgsfermion

here these product cross section need to be multipli by the branch fraction

that the variou cross section measur discuss in the previou section provid
measur of variou combin i j
the product cross section are subject to qcd correct which introduc
theoret uncertainti while the kfactor for the gluon fusion process is larg 23
which suggest a sizabl theoret uncertainti on the product cross section the
nlo correct to the weak boson fusion cross section are essenti ident to the
one encount in deep inelast scatter and are quit small 24 thu we can
assign a small theoret uncertainti to the latter of order 5 while we shall use a
larger theoret error for the gluon fusion process of order 20 23 the problem for
weak boson fusion is that it consist of a mixtur of zz h and w w h event
and we cannot distinguish between the two experiment in a larg class of model
the ratio of hw w and hzz coupl is ident to the one in the sm howev and
thi includ the mssm we therefor make the follow w zunivers assumpt
the h zz and h w w partial width are relat by su2 as in the sm

note that in the higg mass rang of interest these two assumpt are satisfi for

hold in the mssm at tree level but can be violat by larg squark loop contribut
in particular for small ma and larg tan 2526 the second assumpt might be

iv summari
in the last section we have found that variou ratio of higg partial width can
be measur with accuraci of order 10 to 20 with an integr luminos of 100
fb1 per experi thi translat into 5 to 10 measur of variou ratio

the absolut normal of the hw w coupl is access via the extract of the
h w w partial width in weak boson fusion
note that these measur test the crucial aspect of the higg sector the
hw w coupl be linear in the higg field identifi the observ higg boson as
the scalar respons for the spontan break of su2 u1 a scalar without a
vacuum expect valu coupl to gaug boson onli via hhw w or hhw vertic
at tree level ie the interact is quadrat in scalar field the absolut valu of the
hw w coupl as compar to the sm expect reveal whether h may be the onli
mediat of spontan symmetri break or whether addit higg boson await
19
discoveri within the framework of the mssm thi is a measur of sin
at the 005 level the measur of the ratio of ghtt ghw w and gh ghw w then
probe the mass gener of both up and down type fermion
the result present here constitut a first look onli at the issu of coupl extract for the higg thi is the case for the weak boson fusion process in particular
which prove to be extrem valuabl if not essenti our analysi is mostli an estim
of statist error with some rough estim of the systemat error which are to be
expect for the variou measur of partial width and their ratio a number
of issu need to be address in further studi in particular with regard to the weak
boson fusion channel
a the weak boson fusion channel and their background have onli been studi
at the parton level to date full detector level simul and optim of
strategi with more complet detector inform is crucial for further progress
b a central jet veto ha been suggest as a power tool to suppress qcd background to the color singlet exchang process which we call weak boson fusion
the feasibl of thi tool and it reach need to be investig in full detector
studi at both low and high luminos
c in the weak boson fusion studi of h w w and h decay doubl lepton e e pt and pt signatur have not yet been consid their inclus
promis to almost doubl the statist avail for the higg coupl measur at the price of addit zzjet and drellyan plu jet background
which are expect to be manag
d other channel like w h or tth associ product with subsequ decay
h bb or h provid addit inform on higg coupl ratio
120 gev 25
which complement our analysi at small higg mass valu mh
these channel need to be includ in the analysi
20
e much addit work is need on more reliabl background determin for
the h w w pt channel in particular where no narrow higg reson peak can be reconstruct a precis background estim is crucial for
the measur of higg coupl need improv includ nlo qcd
correct singl top quark product background the combin of shower
mont carlo program with higher order qcd matrix element calcul and
more
f both in the inclus and wbf analys ani given channel contain a mixtur of
event from gg h and qq qqh product process the determin
of thi mixtur add anoth sourc of systemat uncertainti which wa not includ in the present studi in ratio of x observ or of differ yi these
uncertainti larg cancel except for the effect of accept variat due to
differ signal select sinc an admixtur from the wrong product channel
is expect at the 10 to 20 level onli these systemat error are not expect
to be seriou
g we have onli analyz the case of a singl neutral cp even higg reson with
coupl which are close to the one predict in the sm while thi case ha mani
applic eg for the larg ma region of the mssm more gener analys in
particular of the mssm case are warrant and highli promis
while much addit work is need our studi clearli show that the lhc ha
excel potenti to provid detail and accur inform on higg boson interact the observ of the higg boson at the lhc ha been clearli establish
within the sm and extens like the mssm the task now is to sharpen the tool for
accur measur of higg boson properti at the lhc
