theoret physic divis cern ch1211 geneva 23 switzerland
the year 1994 mark the begin of the cern lead beam programm a
beam of 33 tev or 160 gev per nucleon lead ion from the sp now extend
the cern relativist heavi ion programm start in the mid eighti to the
heaviest natur occur nuclei a run with lead beam of 40 gev per nucleon
in fall of 1999 complement the program toward lower energi seven larg experi particip in the lead beam program measur mani differ aspect
of leadlead and leadgold collis event na44 na45cer na49 na50
na52newmass wa97na57 and wa98 some of these experi use multipurpos detector to measur simultan and correl sever of the more
abund observ other are dedic experi to detect rare signatur
with high statist thi coordin effort use sever complement experi ha proven veri success the present document summar the most
import result from thi program at the dawn of the rhic era soon the relativist heavi ion collid at bnl will allow to studi goldgold collis at 10 time
higher collis energi
physicist have long thought that a new state of matter could be reach if the
short rang repuls forc between nucleon could be overcom and if squeez
nucleon would merg into one anoth present theoret idea provid a more
precis pictur for thi new state of matter it should be a quarkgluon plasma
qgp in which quark and gluon the fundament constitu of matter are
no longer confin within the dimens of the nucleon but free to move around
over a volum in which a high enough temperatur andor densiti prevail thi
plasma also exhibit the socal chiral symmetri which in normal nuclear matter
is spontan broken result in effect quark mass which are much larger
than the actual mass for the transit temperatur to thi new state lattic
qcd calcul give valu between 140 and 180 mev correspond to an energi
densiti in the neighborhood of 1 gevfm3 or seven time that of nuclear matter
temperatur and energi densiti abov these valu exist in the earli univers
dure the first few microsecond after the big bang
it ha been expect that in high energi collis between heavi nuclei suffici high energi densiti could be reach such that thi new state of matter
would be form quark and gluon would then freeli roam within the volum of
the firebal creat by the collis the individu quark and gluon energi would
1
be typic of a system at veri high temperatur abov 200 mev even if the system should not have enough time to fulli thermal posit identif of the
quarkgluon plasma state in relativist heavi ion collis is howev extrem
difficult if creat the qgp state would have onli a veri transient exist
due to color confin a wellknown properti of strong interact at low energi singl quark and gluon cannot escap from the collis they must alway
combin to colorneutr hadron befor be abl to travel to the detector thi
process is call hadron thu regardless of whether or not qgp is form
in the initi stage the collis firebal later turn into a system of hadron in a
headon leadlead collis at the sp about 2500 particl are creat na49 of
which more than 999 are hadron evid for or against format of an initi
state of deconfin quark and gluon at the sp thu must be extract from a
care and quantit analysi of the observ final state
a common assess of the collect data lead us to conclud that
we now have compel evid that a new state of matter ha inde
been creat at energi densiti which had never been reach over
appreci volum in laboratori experi befor and which exceed
by more than a factor 20 that of normal nuclear matter the new state
of matter found in heavi ion collis at the sp featur mani of the
characterist of the theoret predict quarkgluon plasma
the evid for thi new state of matter is base on a multitud of differ
observ mani hadron observ show a strong nonlinear depend on
the number of nucleon which particip in the collis model base on hadron
interact mechan have consist fail to simultan explain the wealth
of accumul data on the other hand the data exhibit mani of the predict
signatur for a quarkgluon plasma even if a full character of the initi
collis stage is present not yet possibl the data provid strong evid that it
consist of deconfin quark and gluon
we emphas that the evid collect so far is indirect sinc it stem from
the measur of particl which have undergon signific reinteract between the earli collis stage and their final observ still they retain enough
memori of the initi quarkgluon state to provid evid for it format like
the grin of the cheshir cat in alic in wonderland which remain even after the cat
ha disappear it is expect that the present proof by circumstanti evid
for the exist of a quarkgluon plasma in high energi heavi ion collis will
be further substanti by more direct measur eg electromagnet signal
which are emit directli from the quark in the qgp which will becom possibl
at the much higher collis energi and firebal temperatur provid by rhic
at brookhaven and later the lhc at cern
in the follow the most import experiment find and their interpret are describ in more detail
2
hadron are strongli interact particl in nuclear collis after be first
creat they undergo mani secondari interact befor escap from the collis
firebal when they are final set free the firebal volum ha expand by about
a factor 3050 thi inform can be extract from twoparticl correl between ident hadron by a method call boseeinstein interferometri na44
na49 wa98 at thi point the rel abund and momentum distribut
of the hadron still contain import memori of the dens earli collis stage
which can be extract by a comprehens analysi of the hadron final state more
than 20 differ hadron speci includ a few small antinuclei antideuteron
antihelium have been measur by the seven experi na44 na45 na49
na50 na52 wa97 wa98 a combin analysi of their momentum distribut
and twoparticl correl show that at the point where they stop interact
and freez out the firebal is in a state of tremend explos with expans
veloc exceed half the speed of light and veri close to local thermal equilibrium at a temperatur of about 100120 mev thi characterist featur gave rise
to the name littl bang the observ explos call for strong pressur in the
earlier collis stage recent measur anisotropi in the angular distribut
of the momenta perpendicular to the beam direct na49 na45 wa98 indic
that the pressur wa built up quickli point to intens rescatt in the earli
collis stage
an earlier glimps of the expand system is provid by a measur of
correl electronpositron pair also call dilepton na45 these data show
that in sulphurgold and leadgold collis the expect peak from the rho
vector meson a particl which can decay into dilepton even befor freezeout is
complet smear out simultan na45 find in leadgold collis an excess
of dilepton in the mass region between 250 and 700 mev by about a factor 3 abov
expect from hadron decay scale from protonnucleon to leadgold collis
theori explain thi by a broaden of the s spectral function result from
scatter among pion and nucleon in a veri dens hadron firebal just below
the critic energi densiti for quarkgluon plasma format the meson mix
with it partner under chiral symmetri transform signal the onset of chiral
symmetri restor as matter becom denser and denser
the theoret analysi of the measur hadron abund na44 na45
na49 na50 na52 wa97 wa98 show that they reflect a state of chemic
equilibrium at a temperatur of about 170 mev thi point to an even earlier
stage of the collis in fact such temperatur correspond to an energi densiti of about 1 gevfm3 are the highest allow one befor accord to lattic
qcd hadron should dissolv into quark and gluon the observ are explain by assum that at thi temperatur the hadron were form by a statist hadron process from a preexist quarkgluon system theoret
studi show that at cern energi subsequ interact among the hadron
while caus pressur and drive the expans and cool of the firebal are
veri ineffect in chang the abund ratio thi is whi after account for
3
the decay of unstabl reson the final measur hadron yield reflect rather
accur the condit at the quarkhadron transit
a particularli strike aspect of thi appar chemic equilibrium at the
quarkhadron transit temperatur is the observ enhanc rel to protoninduc collis of hadron contain strang quark global when normal to the number of particip nucleon thi enhanc correspond to a
factor 2 na49 but hadron contain more than one strang quark are enhanc
much more strongli wa97 na49 na50 up to a factor 15 for the omega hyperon and it antiparticl wa97 leadlead collis are thu qualit differ from a superposit of independ nucleonnucleon collis that the rel
enhanc is found to increas with the strang quark content of the produc
hadron contradict predict from hadron rescatt model where secondari
product of multistrang antibaryon is hinder by high mass threshold and
low cross section sinc the hadron abund appear to be frozen in at the point of
hadron format thi enhanc signal a new and faster strangenessproduc
process befor or dure hadron involv intens rescatt among quark
and gluon thi effect wa predict about 20 year ago as a quarkgluon plasma
signatur result from a combin of larg gluon densiti and a small strang
quark mass in thi color deconfin chiral symmetr state experiment it
is found not onli in leadlead collis but even in central sulphurnucleu collis with target nuclei rang from sulphur to lead na35 wa85 wa94 thi
is consist with estim of initi energi densiti abov the critic valu of 1
gevfm3 even in those collis
evid for the format of a transient quarkgluon phase without color confin is further provid by the observ suppress of the charmonium state
j c and na50 these particl contain charm quark and antiquark c
and c which are so heavi that they can onli be produc at the veri begin
when the constitu of the collid nuclei still have their full energi as one vari
the size of the collid nuclei and the central of the collis one find after subtract the expect absorpt effect from final state interact between the c
c
pair and the nucleon of the interpenetr nuclei a success of suppress pattern the most weakli bound state is suppress alreadi in sulphururanium
collis na38 the intermedi c seem to disappear quit suddenli in semicentr leadlead collis and in the most central leadlead collis an addit
reduct of the j yield indic that now also the strongli bound j ground
state itself is significantli suppress na50 the observ of c suppress is
indirect via it 3040 contribut to the measur j yield which is expect
from scale protonproton measur charmonium suppress wa predict
15 year ago as a consequ of color screen in a quarkgluon plasma which
should keep the charm quarkantiquark pair from bind to each other accord to thi predict suppress the j requir temperatur which are
about 30 abov the color deconfin temperatur or energi densiti of about
3 gevfm3 thi agre with estim of the initi energi densiti reach in
4
central leadlead collis base on calorimetri or on a backextrapol from
the freezeout stage to the timei befor expans start it wa tri to reproduc
the data by assum that the charmonia are destroy sole by final state interact with surround hadron none of these attempt can account for the shape
of the central depend of the observ suppress on the other hand the
interpret of thi pattern in term of color screen by deconfin quark and
gluon lead to the predict of a similar suppress pattern at rhic in much
smaller nuclei thi predict will soon be test
in spite of it mani facet the result pictur is simpl the two collid nuclei
deposit energi into the reaction zone which materi in the form of quark and
gluon which strongli interact with each other thi earli veri dens state energi
densiti about 34 gevfm3 mean particl momenta correspond to t 240 mev
suppress the format of charmonia enhanc strang and begin to drive the
expans of the firebal subsequ the plasma cool down and becom more
dilut at an energi densiti of 1 gevfm3 t 170 mev the quark and gluon
hadron and the final hadron abund are fix at an energi densiti of order 50
mevfm3 t 100120 mev the hadron stop interact and the firebal freez out
at thi point it expand with more than half the light veloc
thi doe not happen onli in a few special collis event but essenti
in everi leadlead collis characterist observ like the averag transvers
momentum of produc particl or the kaonpion ratio show onli the statist
expect fluctuat in a thermal ensembl around averag valu which are
the same in all collis na49 sinc the kaonpion ratio is essenti fix
at the point of hadron thi indic the absenc of longrang correl
like those expect in a fullydevelop thermodynam phase transit a better
theoret understand of the phasetransit dynam might emerg from these
observ the shortrang charact suggest similar with the transit
found in hightc superconduct
direct observ of the quarkgluon plasma may be possibl via electromagnet radiat emit by the quark dure the hot initi stage search for thi
radiat were perform at the sp wa98 na45 na50 but are difficult due to
high background from other sourc for sulphurgold collis wa80 and na45
establish that not more than 5 of the observ photon are emit directli for
leadlead collis wa98 have report indic for a signific direct photon
contribut preliminari data from na45 are consist with thi find but so
far not statist signific na50 ha seen an excess by about a factor 2 in
the dimuon spectrum in the mass region between the and j vector meson
the predict electromagnet radiat rate at the abov mention temperatur
are margin for detect while under these condit it is a great experiment
achiev to have obtain posit evid for a signal it connect with the
predict thermal plasma radiat is not yet firmli establish
thi is expect to chang at the higher collis energi provid by rhic and
5
lhc the much higher initi temperatur up to nearli 1000 mev for leadlead
collis at the lhc have been predict and longer plasma lifetim should facilit the direct observ of the plasma radiat and lead to the product of
addit heavi charm quark by gluongluon scatter in the qgp phase the
much higher initi energi densiti which can be reach at rhic and lhc give us
more time until the quark and gluon rehadron thu allow for a quantit
character of the quarkgluon plasma and detail studi of it earli tharmal process and dynam evolut final the higher collis energi
allow for the product of jet with larg transvers momenta whose lead quark
can be use as hard penetr probe within the quarkgluon plasma at rhic
a set of four larg detector with complementari goal and capabl ensur
that all experiment aspect of ultrarelativist heavi ion collis are optim
cover the abil of the collid to simultan acceler and collid nuclei of
differ size and energi promis a complet understand of systemat trend
as one proce from protonproton via protonnucleu to goldgold collis as in
solid state physic where the knowledg of the basic interact lagrangian qed
doe not permit to reliabl predict mani bulk properti and where the detail
understand of the latter is usual driven by experi we expect that such
a systemat experiment studi of strongli interact matter will eventu lead
to a quantit understand of bulk qcd we are look forward to these
farreach opportun provid by rhic and lhc
