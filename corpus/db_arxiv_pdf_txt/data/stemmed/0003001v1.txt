the articl is devot to mathemat method of experiment detect of interact phenomena in complex system and their analysi
thi articl may be regard as an account of conclus from the ten year author practic research on the joint of experiment mathemat experiment
psychophys and comput scienc in the problem of visual percept in the interact videosystem and from hi parallel theoret studi on interact and
tactic the current exposit is selfconsist and claim a minim knowledg
of the experiment or theoret basi which underli it the goal of the articl
is to discuss the method of experiment detect of interact phenomena and
of their analysi though the author had deal presum with the interact phenomena in percept the result scheme is applic to mani system of natur
behavior social and econom scienc and it is reason to think that mani
concret specialist will find it use for their own need in the nearest futur
i experiment detect of interact phenomena
let us consid a natur behavior social or econom system s it will be
describ by a set of quntiti which character it at ani moment of time t
so that t one may suppos that the evolut of the system is describ
by a differenti equat
and look for the explicit form of the function from the experiment data on the
system s howev the function may depend on time it mean that there are
some hidden paramet which control the system s and it evolut is of the
form
u
where u are such paramet of unknown natur one may suspect that such
paramet are chosen in a way to minim some goal function k which may be
an integrodifferenti function of t
k k t
such integrodifferenti depend will be briefli notat as k k below
more gener the paramet u may be divid on part u u1 un and each
part ui ha it own goal function ki howev thi hypothesi may be confirm
by the experi veri rare in the most case the choic of paramet u will
seem accident or even random nevertheless one may suspect that the control
ui are interact it mean that they are the coupl of the pure control ui with
the unknown or incomplet known feedback
ui ui ui
and each pure control ha it own goal function ki thu it is suspect that the
system s realiz an interact game there are sever way to defin the pure
control ui one of them is the integrodifferenti filtrat of the control ui
ui fi ui
to verifi the formul hypothesi and to find the explicit form of the conveni
filtrat fi and goal function ki one should use the theori of interact game
which suppli us by the predict of the game and compar the predict with
the real histori of the game for ani consid fi and ki and choos such filtrat
and goal function which describ the realiti better one may suspect that the
depend of ui on is pure differenti for simplic or to introduc the socal intent field which allow to consid ani interact game as differenti
moreov one may suppos that
ui ui ui
and appli the elabor procedur of a posteriori analysi and predict to the
system
in mani case thi simpl algorithm effect unravel the hidden interact
of a complex system
ii analysi of interact phenomena
below we shall consid the complex system s which have been yet repres
as the nperson interact game by the procedur describ abov
21 function analysi of interact phenomena to perform an analysi
of the interact control let us note that often for the nperson interact game
the interact control ui ui ui may be repres in the form
ui ui ui i
where the depend of the interact control on the argument ui and i is
known but the paramet i are the unknown or incomplet known function
of ui such represent is veri use in the theori of interact game and
is call the represent
one may regard paramet as new magnitud which character the system
and appli the algorithm of the unravel of interact to them note that paramet are of an existenti natur depend as on the state of the system
s as on the control
2
the paramet are use for the function analysi of the interact control
describ below
first of all let us consid new integrodifferenti filtrat v
v v
where 1 n second we shall suppos that the paramet are express via the new control v which will be call desir
i v1 vm
and the least have the goal function l the procedur of unravel of interact specifi as the filtrat v as the goal function l
exampl let us consid the interact videosystem direct by the eye movement of an observ the pure control are the slow movement of eye wherea
saccad are consid as a result of the unknown feedback tremor is suppos to
be random mani classic and modern experi clarifi the role of saccad
in the format of the stabl and complet final imag so such format may
be regard as their goal function the function analysi of the eye movement
extract the paramet the normal form which describ saccad in the concret interact videosystem the normal form are extrem interest in the
multius mode when the saccad of variou observ begin to be correl and
synchron
22 the second quantiz of desir intuit it is reason to consid system with a variabl number of desir it can be done via the second
quantiz
to perform the second quantiz of desir let us mention that they are defin
as the integrodifferenti function of and via the integrodifferenti filtrat
so one is abl to defin the linear space h of all filtrat regard as classic
field and a submanifold m of the dual h so that h is natur identifi with a
subspac of the linear space om of smooth function on m the quantiz field
of desir are certain oper in the space om one is abl to regard them as
unbound oper in it certain hilbert complet the creationannihil
oper are construct from the oper of multipl on an element of
h om and their conjug
to defin the quantum dynam one should separ the quick and slow time
quick time is use to make a filtrat and the dynam is realiz in slow time
such dynam may have a hamiltonian form be govern by a quantum hamiltonian which is usual differenti oper in om
if m coincid with the whole h then the quadrat part of a hamiltonian describ a propag of the quantum desir wherea the highest term correspond
to the vertex structur of selfinteract of the quantum field if the submanifold m is nonlinear the extract of propag and interact vertic is not
straightforward
23 sdtransform and sdpair the interest featur of the propos descript which will be call the spictur of an interact system s is that it
contain as the real usual person subject with the pure control ui as the
imperson desir v the least are interpret as certain perturb of the
3
first so the subject act in the system by the interact control ui wherea the
desir are hidden in their action
one is abl to construct the dual pictur the dpictur where the desir act
in the system s interact and the pure control of the real subject are hidden
in their action precis the evolut of the system is govern by the equat
v
where v v1 vm are the repres interact desir
v v v
and the paramet are the unknown or incomplet known function of the
state and the pure control ui
dpictur is conveni for a descript of system s with a variabl number
of act person addit of a new person doe not make ani influenc on the
evolut equat a subsidiari term to the paramet should be ad onli
the transit from the spictur to the dpictur is call the sdtransform
the sdpair is defin by the evolut equat in the system s of the form
u
v
where u u1 un v v1 vm
ui ui ui i
v v v
and the paramet 1 n and
1 m are the unknown or
incomplet known function of and v v1 vm
or u u1 un
respect
note that the spictur and the dpictur may be regard as complementari
in the nbohr sens both descript of the system s can not be appli to it
simultan dure it analysi howev they are compat and the structur
of sdpair is a manifest of their compat the choic of a pictur is an
action of our attent it is concentr on the person subject in spictur
the selfconsci attent wherea it is concentr on the imperson desir
in dpictur the creativ attent
24 verbal of sdpair and synlingu the main problem is to
interrel the s and dpictur of the system s one way is a verbal of
sdpair let us remind a definit of the verbaliz interact game
an interact game of the form
u
with repres coupl of feedback
ui ui ui i

is call verbaliz if there exist a posteriori partit t0 t1 t2 tn
and the integrodifferenti function
n tn1
un u tn1
tn
tn
such that
n n1 un tn1
tn
quantiti n are call the word
let us now consid the sdpair and suppos that both s and dpictur are
verbaliz with the same n the fact that n are the same for both s and
dpictur is call their synlingu one may character it poetic by the
phrase that the speech of real subject is result in the same text as a whisper
of the imperson desir the existenti charact of the synlingu should be
stress realli it is not deriv from the fact that the object state of the
system s are the same in the s and dpictur the synlingu interrel the
differ paramet of existenti natur in both pictur
the synlingu is veri import in the analysi of tactic phenomena which
essenti use the concept of verbal in their definit to my mind the
synlingu lie in the basi of psychophys natur of mutual understand of
the independ subject of a dialogu commun in thi situat it allow
to identifi the person interpret with the imperson one unravel the
role of imperson desir as bearer of the object sens and it dynam
to the verbaliz sdpair some procedur of linguist analysi are applic some of them are inherit from the verbaliz interact game the
grammat analysi some are specif the explic and analysi of object
sens
iii conclus
thu mathemat procedur of the experiment detect of interact phenomena in complex natur behavior social and econom system and their
analysi are describ the special attent is concentr on the role of desir
and their second quantiz as well as on the abstract structur of sdpair their
verbal and the synlingu
