i introduct
the determin of equilibrium structur is one of the most import target in electron structur calcul analyt gradient provid an import tool to facilit
thi and therefor the implement of analyt gradient ha becom an import part
of modern code although most solid state calcul are nowaday perform within the
framework of densiti function theori hartreefock theori can serv as a use start
point for a correl treatment in the field of quantum chemistri a hartreefock solut is necessari to make a wavefunct base correl scheme such as for exampl
the coupledclust approach applic therefor the determin of a hartreefock
solut is often an import target
the calcul of hartreefock gradient wa pioneer by pulay who perform the
first implement for multicent basi sets1 it should be mention that the theori had
alreadi been deriv earlier independently2 analyt gradient have becom an import
area in quantum chemistri and sever review articl have been published36
signific work ha alreadi been perform for onedimension system formula for
analyt gradient with respect to nuclear coordin as well as with respect to the lattic
vector have been deriv and implement in a period code7 and the theori ha been
extend to metal systems8 further progress ha been the deriv and implement
of formula for mp2 energy910 and gradients11 as well as gradient on the densiti function
level12 even formula for second deriv have meanwhil been coded13 recent a
scheme for an accur treatment of longrang coulomb effect in hartreefock gradient
ha been presented14 and a new implement of densiti function energi and gradient
for period system ha been demonst to be highli effici and accurate15
in thi articl we report on an implement of hartreefock gradient with respect
to nuclear coordin in a gener period code the crystal1619 packag which is to
the best of our knowledg the first implement for the case of 2 and 3 dimension
period

the articl is structur as follow in section ii the basi function and hartreefock
equat are given the calcul of integr which reli on the mcmurchiedavidson
algorithm and the calcul of gradient of the integr is explain in section iii and
iv the total energi as calcul by the crystal code is given in section v in section
vi we explain the calcul of forc and possibl sourc of error final in section vii
we illustr the accuraci of the gradient with some exampl
ii basi function and hartreefock equat
in thi section we summar the basi function use in the crystal code and give
the structur of the hartreefock equat
a basi function

real spheric gaussian type function are defin as

r r a n l m im s r a n l m
crystal use real spheric gaussian type function which are in the follow denot
as r a n r a n l m with the normal n is an index enumer

the basi function in the refer cell eg the primit unit cell although the code
allow onli the use of sgtf with n 0 in the process of the evalu of molecular
integr sgtf with n 0 are used20
b hartreefock equat
the hartreefock treatment of period systems21 is briefli repeat in thi section
we assum that orbit are doubli occupi and work within the restrict hartreefock

with the fermi energi f and the heavisid function i is an index enumer the
eigenvalu the densiti matrix in real space p0g is obtain by fourier transform

iii calcul of integr
a type of integr
in thi section we summar the appear type of integr thi is done with the
assumpt that the basi function are real
1 overlap integr
the basic integr is the overlap integr
r a g1 r a g2 d3 r
sg1 g2

the integr is over the whole space ie x from to and similarli for y and
z exploit translat invari we can rewrit thi as

where a is defin as the coulomb potenti in the molecular case as the eulermaclaurin potenti for system period in one dimension2223 as parri potential24 for
system period in two dimens and as the ewald potenti for system period in three
dimensions2526 the a summat run over all nuclei of the primit unit cell

4 electronelectron coulomb interact integr
a bielectron integr can be defin as
b0g nnh
r a r a g r a n r a n h 3 3
d rd r
r r
11
in the context of period system it is necessari to perform summat over all lattic
vector g h n we defin a coulomb integr as follow
pen
c0g 0h
n
r a r a g r a n r a n h 3 3
d rd r
r r

b0g nnh
12
n
the penetr depth pen is defin as those term for which
gmin r a gmin r a g12 gmin r a nd3 r 10it ol2
13
min
hold with gamin r 2a 34 expamin r2
gamin r mean the lowest expon of all gaussian center at aa for these integr
the coulomb interact is evalu without approxim all the other integr are
evalu with a multipolar expans it ol2 is a toler which can be chosen by the
user of the code thi criterion introduc an asymmetri in the energi express a given
bielectron integr might be evalu in differ way for b0g nnh and b nnh0g
avoid thi would howev be veri ineffici to keep the symmetri the lattic sum
would have to be further broken down into piec which are evalu exactli and other
piec which are approxim thi would requir a much higher comput effort
and more disk storag the simpler criterion in equat 13 minim the effort and when
it ol2 is chosen suffici larg the violat of the symmetri is neglig we will
illustr thi with some exampl in section vii

15
howev for effici reason two differ threshold have been
introduced16 which lead to anoth possibl asymmetri an exchang integr is discard
when the pseudooverlap associ with r a and r a g or the pseudooverlap
associ with r a n and r a n h is smaller than certain threshold 10it ol4 and 10it ol5 it is recommend that the threshold it ol5 associ with
r a n and r a n h should be higher than it ol4 thi howev will
lead to a violat of equat 15 and therefor anoth asymmetri in the energi express
a further cutoff paramet it ol3 select the exchang integr symmetr exchang
integr are also neglect if the overlap of r a with r a n or the overlap
of r a g with r a n h is lower as 10it ol3 thi is a symmetr cutoff
and therefor should not lead to an inaccuraci in the forc

a gradient within the mcmurchiedavidson algorithm
the evalu of gradient of the integr is close relat to the evalu of
the integr themselv
all the integr can be express with the help of the e
coefficients27202630 in the follow we show how deriv of the integr can be express in a similar way with hermit gaussian type function start from equat 23

of complex spheric gaussian type function a transform to real spheric gaussian

in our implement we therefor comput the gradient of the two gaussian which
are associ with the integr by replac ecoeffici with gcoeffici as a consequ if an oper which might appear in the integr ha a nonvanish deriv
such as for exampl the nuclear attract thi must be taken into account addit
thi deriv with respect to the third center can be obtain by appli translat
invari with respect to a simultan uniform translat of the three center in the
case of bielectron integr product with two ecoeffici appear obvious when differenti the correspond rule of differenti a product must be appli and two
deriv term appear each of them consist of a product of one set of e and one set
of gcoeffici final the nuclearnuclear term must be differenti which is trivial

it is interest to compar thi implement with that of the namur group14 where
also gradient within the mcmurchiedavidson algorithm are comput

we note that thi express for the fock oper would be exact if we could guarante that the penetr depth and screen wa symmetr thi would requir that

c0g 0h c 0h0g should alway hold thi howev as aforement cannot be
guarante becaus the truncat is not necessarili symmetr in addit the screen
of the exchang interact is not necessarili symmetr therefor an inaccuraci in the
fock oper will show up which will be stronger the more asymmetr the truncat in
the energi express is

and the hartreefock equat becom as in equat 5 in ref 26 it wa point out
that the quantiti qs0g can be remov from the fock oper which ha been done in

the last addend is the energi weight densiti matrix the integr is over the first
brillouin zone it is worthwhil mention that the factor pg0 s0g is equal to the number
of electron in the unit cell and therefor it deriv with respect to ai vanish we note
three import point
equat 62 is correct for the exact solut of the hartreefock equat thu in
practic a well converg solut is necessari to achiev accur forc
22
the energyweight densiti matrix is kdepend therefor the accuraci of the
forc will becom depend on the number of kpoint
the deriv of equat 62 assum that equat 59 hold the treatment of the
coulomb seri with finit penetr depth lead to an asymmetri associ with
it ol2 in the crystal code in addit in the treatment of the exchang seri
an asymmetri can be introduc if the screen paramet it ol4 and it ol5 in
the crystal code are chosen differ therefor the choic of it ol2 it ol4
and it ol5 will influenc the accuraci of the gradient
vii result from test calcul
with a few exampl we want to illustr the accuraci of the analyt comput
gradient
in tabl i all the integr are evalu without approxim and the analyt
deriv agre to five digit with the numer deriv as the numer deriv is
onli accur up to five digit thi is certainli satisfi
in tabl ii the variat in accuraci when penetr depth and overlap criteria are
alter is display as describ in the articl lower it ol2 to low valu lead to
inaccuraci in the gradient lower onli one of the paramet it ol4 or it ol5 also
lead to inaccuraci wherea lower both to the same valu give an analyt gradient
which is consist with the numer gradient howev as a valu of 1 for it ol4
and it ol5 wa chosen energi and forc are complet differ from calcul with
reason valu for it ol4 and it ol5 the paramet it ol1 which select the oneelectron and coulomb integr accord to the overlap can lead to numer instabl
in the energi calcul and inaccur gradient when chosen too low and should therefor
be reason high the paramet it ol3 doe not influenc the accuraci of the gradient
although when chosen much too low with a valu of eg 1 numer and analyt gradient
still agre the default valu for the it olparamet for the energi calcul are 6 6
23
6 6 and 12 in all calcul perform so far these default valu did not lead to seriou
error for the gradient
anoth exampl tabl iii is the co molecul arrang as a singl molecul
molecul as a molecul period repeat in one dimens polym in two
dimens slab and in three dimens bulk the forc agre well and it is
demonstr that use stricter realspac truncat paramet improv the agreement
the forc seem to be rel insensit to the number of sampl point and chang
their number chang the error in the forc onli slightli
final in tabl iv we compar analyt and numer deriv for mgo when
move the oxygen atom in xdirect which would correspond to a longitudin phonon
h
default it ol paramet were use
again agreement is to the order of 105 e
ab
viii conclus
we present the theori of analyt hartreefock gradient for period system thi
ha been implement in the code crystal which is to the best of our knowledg the first
implement of hartreefock gradient in system period in 2 and 3 dimens the
result are in excel agreement with numer deriv
futur direct will be the improv of the effici of the code implement
of symmetri and variou technic improv deriv with respect to the lattic
vector as well as an extens to metal system
