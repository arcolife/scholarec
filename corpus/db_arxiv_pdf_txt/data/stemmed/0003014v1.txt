depend on sign of 2 thi equat is call kp2 if 2 1
in thi work the asymptot behaviour of decreas solut of
equat kp2 is obtain as t the main term of the asymptot ha an order by ot1 and fast oscil an envelop of these
oscil depend on xt and yt result of the work
are formul in term of scatter data for auxiliari linear problem which is associ with equat kp2 in the invers scatter

the equat kp play import role in modern mathemat
physic mani applic of these equat are known in plasma
physic water wave and other field of wave process 4 therefor question about solvabl of thi equat in differ function
class were studi in detail in particular the exist of global solut of cauchi problem in class of distribut function wa prove
in 5 a norm of solut in sobolev space wa estim and an
asymptot of a solut were obtain as t for kplike equat but with more high nonlinear which call gener equat kp in 6
the ist formal allow to reduc a construct of the solut
of nonlinear integr equat into solv of linear problem one of
most import achiev of ist is the construct of asymptot
behaviour of solut as t these result are wellknown for
11dimension equat one spatial and one tempor variabl
713 asymptot behaviour of solut for 21dimension
equat were studi not so in detail rigor result about tempor asymptot of solut which is nonuniform with respect to
spatial variabl for a special class of nondecreas solut were obtain in 14 15 in work 16 an formal asymptot of decreas
solut of equat kp1 which is nonuniform with respect to spatial variabl wa construct result about asymptot behaviour
of decreas solut of equat kp2 as t and about a remaind of thi asymptot which are uniform with respect to spatial
variabl are obtain in present work
the formal ist for solv of cauchi problem for equat
kp2 wa present in 17 thi formal will be use in thi work
below we remind basic step of solv of cauchi problem for equat
kp2 by ist
let us denot an initi condit for equat kp2 as
ut0 u0 x y

the process of solv of the cauchi problem 1 2 consist of
sever step
first step is solv direct scatter problem on thi step a
boundari problem is solv for function
y x2 2ikx u 0

and scatter data are construct by a formula

it is use to note if u is real then the function f k ha properti
f k thi follow from formula 3 and 4

on the next step an evolut of scatter data is determin
thi evolut is veri simpl

function f k is nonanalyt with respect to complex variabl k c
solv of thi problem allow to obtain the function and at ani
time if we know the evolut of scatter data
at last we can obtain the solut of the cauchi problem by use
the formula 17

howev thi success method of solv for cauchi problem
for gener initi condit allow to obtain veri implicit answer
with respect to initi data therefor the problem 5 and integr
6 are use usual for solv of integr nonlinear equat and
the scatter data is take from some suitabl function class see
for exampl 1416 on onehand side thi give for studi a
function class of solut but on the other handsid thi lead to
implicit restrict on class of initi condit
the auxiliari linear problem 3 and some relat problem were
studi in 1823 in the work 23 it wa prove that if the function
u0 x y decreas exponenti then the direct scatter problem
3 is solvabl for k c
to construct the asymptot of u as t we use the asymptot
of and evalu an asymptot of the integr 6 by stationari
phase method 24 as it turn out the main term of asymptot
of the function u may be defin by use onli the main term of
an asymptot expans of as t take into account the
3
fast oscil coeffici of the system from 5 one can guess that
1 o1 as t but we cannot say someth definit about
the asymptot behaviour of the function u until we do not know
analyt properti and an order of the remaind of asymptot of
more precis thu we come to studi an asymptot behaviour
of a solut of the dproblem
5
the asymptot behaviour of the solut of the dproblem
as
t with continu and fast oscil coeffici wa obtain in
25 here we studi the dproblem
with discontinu coeffici on
imaginari axi of complex paramet k construct of the asymptot of solut for such problem is more complic not onli
stationari point of phase function of an oscil expon defin a
structur of the asymptot solut for 5 as in 25 see also 26
but the locat of these stationari point with respect to line of discontinu of coeffici of the equat 5 as well it contribut
addit difficulti into evalu and lead to chang in result
the uniform asymptot of the solut of the problem 5 is construct by match method 27

the domain of valid for the asymptot of the solut of equat kp2 are intersect and therefor they give combin asymptot of the solut uniformli on plane of x y
3 an analyt behaviour of the scatter data
in thi section we demonstr analyt behaviour of the scatter
data which correspond to suffici smooth and decreas initi
condit 2
first of all we show that the solut of 5 exist
theorem 2 let f k be such that the condit 7 is fulfil then
the solut of 5 exist in a space of continu vectorfunct
bound when k c
proof let us consid a system of integr equat which is
equival to 5

use wellknown result about integr oper see for exampl
29 one can show that the oper gf transform the space of
continu vectorfunct into itself
the oper gf is contract oper it is follow from inequ 7 henc we obtain the theorem statement
to construct the asymptot we must studi smooth of scatter data f k in neighborhood of line of discontinu rek 0
lemma 1 let u0 x y be a finit function then in neighborhood of
some point k c the scatter data have to be repres in the
form

the function f m
and x y m are smooth on the left and righthand side of complex plane of m and one can show that the integr
exist let us repres it into more conveni form for thi we
rewrit the integr into sum of two integr over lefthand side and
righthand side of complex plane let us integr by part these
integr as a result we obtain

here is righthand side and lefthand side of complex plane
we mean the integr over as sum of integr over righthand side
and lefthand side of the circl with center at origin of coordin and
with larg radiu which tend into infin and of improp integr
over imaginari line and of an integr over the circl with small radiu
with center at k m the direct of the integr over is
determin by standard way
consid the sum of the integr over each of the integr
over larg halfcircl is equal to zero as r becaus the integrand
decreas the sum of the integr over the imaginari axi give
doubl integr over the imaginari axi in posit direct the
integr over small circl equal zero as 0
let us evalu the deriv m f m
of the integrand of the
0
doubl integr for thi we note that x y k 0 x y k
henc f m
ha to be repres by the function x y m 0 and
then

the asymptot solut of the problem 8 is combin here
we construct the asymptot as t uniformli with respect to
all paramet the stationari point of the function sk k
with respect to paramet k k play the import role in these
construct
the asymptot expans of the solut is construct use
the invers power of larg paramet t as a asymptot sequenc of
asymptot expans outsid of small neighborhood of the stationari
point of the function near the stationari point the asymptot
sequenc ha the form tn2 where n 0 1 2 follow the
terminolog of match method 27 we call the asymptot outsid
of small neighborhood of stationari point by outer expans and we
call by interior expans the asymptot near the stationari point
the righthand side in the system of equat 8 is discontinu on
the line rek 0 therefor the asymptot solut is differenti
out of the line rek 0
the domain of valid for interior and exterior asymptot expans are intersect thi fact is use by match method in
order to construct uniqu combin asymptot expans
the phase function s depend on two paramet r2 on
the curv 12 2 0 the confluenc of two stationari point of the
function s occur in thi case we have one confluent stationari point
the structur of the asymptot expans of solut of 8 is chang
here as 12 2 1 the expans is construct on the power of
tn3 n 0 1 2 as a asymptot sequenc
the formula for the uniform asymptot expans of the solut
of 8 are larg and it seem conveni to formul the result about
gener case in section 41 and about confluenc case in section 42 for
conveni

asymptot in a gener case
in thi section the combin asymptot solut of 8 is construct
when the phase function s ha nondegener stationari point k k1
and k k2 here we suppos that k c t13 k2 skk12 1 as

t thi lead to restrict on valu of the paramet and
name t13 12 2 1 the asymptot expans which is
uniform with respect to k c is formul in the end of thi section
to construct the combin asymptot solut which is valuabl as
k c we obtain exterior and interior asymptot expans these
expans are valid outsid of small neighborhood of kj j 1 2
and in the small neighborhood of kj respect denot

the proof let us construct the asymptot the extern expans is construct similarli as in 411 the main differ is that
the stationari point of the function s are on the line of discontinu
of the coeffici of system 8 it lead to suffici modif in
the formula for asymptot let us find the extern expans in
the form

after substitut of 34 and 35 into the system 8 we equat the
coeffici with ident power of t and with oscil and nonoscil term correspondingli as a result we obtain equat for the

in thi section we prove that the remaind of the asymptot ha
order by t43 uniformli with respect to k c and thi remaind ha
to be differenti with respect to x we call by the remaind of the
asymptot the differ between solut of the problem 8 and
construct asymptot solut 33 when 2 t23 1 49 when
2 t23 1 and 77 when 1 the differenti of the

show that the remaind of the asymptot is differenti on

the remaind denot the deriv of the vector v by then we
obtain

the term x gf v x h may be evalu by order ot43
the oper gf is contract therefor one can obtain
