abstract we give a new deriv of the minim veloc estim siso1 for unitari evolut
let h and a be selfadjoint oper on a hilbert space h the start point is mourr inequ
ih a 0 which is suppos to hold in form sens on the spectral subspac h of h for
k
some interv r the second assumpt is that the multipl commut ada h are wellbehav for k 1 n n 2 then we show that for a dens set of s in h and all m n1
t expiht is contain in the spectral subspac a t as t up to an error of order
tm in norm we appli thi gener result to the case where h is a schroding oper on
rn
and a the dilat gener prove that t x is asymptot support in the set x t
up to an error of order tm in norm

thi is of cours weaker than 14 it onli say that the mean valu of x2 for the probabl distribut

commut the hypothesi ada f h lh may be replac by condit on ada h which are
more subtl to formul sinc the oper a and h are gener unbound see eg abg jmp for
the special case 18 thi is further discuss below
resolv smooth and local decay we indic briefli how minim veloc estim are relat to
resolv smooth jmp and to local decay pss let a 1 a2 12 set a t2 and use
that
a a a ct ot
we obtain from 111
a eiht gha const 1 t minm
for m 1 thi is integr over t which by fourier transform lead to the resolv
estim
sup a z h1 gha
113
z r
similar estim for the deriv with respect to z higher power of the resolv z h1 are obtain
use correspondingli higher valu of m resolv smooth replac g by g 2 in 113 it also follow
that the oper a is hsmooth for 1 and therefor rsiv theorem xiii25 and corollari

114
where is ani fix compact subset of local decay by an independ argument of mourr given in
pss the estim 113 and therefor 114 can be improv from 1 to 12
our second result is an applic of theorem 11 to the schroding equat 11 here a is given by
18 and
k
ik ada h 2k1 p2 x k v x
115
a simpl way to satisfi the hypothesi of theorem 11 in thi case is to assum that v ha rel bound
less than 1 with respect to 21 p2 and that the distribut x k v x are local l2 and as multipl
oper bound rel to p2 for k 1 n then the oper 115 are bound rel to h and it
k
is straightforward to comput and to estim the the norm of ada z h1 for imz 0 repres
f h by the resolv z h1 eg use the helffersjostrand formula hesj dav it then follow
k
that ada f h is bound for k 1 n the result is that fast decay larg m in 111 must be paid
for by high smooth of v x for all x thi is unnatur and in fact there is a better way to construct a
which requir onli smooth of v x for arbitray larg x the idea is to replac x2 in 19 by a smooth
convex function gx which is equal to x2 for larg x but constant in some abitrari larg ball x r
then a chang to

and the mourr inequ can be establish as befor then the oper ada p2 remain second order
in p with bound coeffici while
k
ik ada v gx k v x
requir onli deriv of v x in the region x r a more car construct of gx due to graf
gra1 is special adapt to the n bodi case requir onli smooth of the pair potenti for larg
separ see skib gri the follow result can also be proven in thi more gener set
theorem 12 let h and a be given by 11 and 18 then under the hypothesi of theorem 11
x2 2at t2 eiht gh a a const tm
116
for ani in 0 ani m n 1 and ani a r
we remark that for initi state of the form 113 thi is equival to
dx t x

117
the proof of these result are given in section 2 the main tool is the method of commut expans
summar in section 3
we conclud the introduct with some not exhaust bibliograph note minim veloc estim
were first given by sigal and soffer siso1 and then extend by skibst ski and by gerard and sigal gesi
with applic to scatter theori siso2 sig hesk and to the theori of reson gesi sow
nier our deriv is similar in spirit to ski and incorpor remark by froes and loss frlo the
relat subject of resolv smooth and local decay is more fulli treat by timeindepend method
eg in pss jmp and gi where further refer can be found the gener of mourr
theorem use the construct of graf gra1 first appear in ski a simpler proof due to graf gra2 is
given in gri for other applic of mourr inequ to wave equat and spectral geometri see

proof
the follow lemma give the basic estim for a proof by bootstrap of theorem 11 a smooth function
f on r is said to be of order p if for each k
f k x const xpk
lemma 21 suppos that a h and g satisfi the hypothesi of theorem 11 let f be a posit c function on r of order 4 with f 0 and f x 0 for x 0 let 1 s a r as s1 a a
and 1 then
ghih f as gh s1 ghf as gh
s1 ghf1 as gh
const s2n1 g 2 h

21
uniformli in a r where f1 is a function on r which again satisfi the hypothesi state for f
proof in the commut ih f as occur in 21 we can replac h by a bound oper
hb h bh
22
where b c0 r b 1 on suppg then the commut
k
bk i ada hb
k 1n
are bound by hypothesi as a first step we show that
ihb f as s1 f as 12 b1 f as 12 remaind
23
here and in the rest of the proof a remaind is defin as a quadrat form rem with an estim
rem s1 f1 as const s2n1
24
uniformli in a where f1 is a function on r satisfi the hypothesi for f ani such remaind clearli
fit into 21 and need no further consider to prove 23 we factor f f 2 and then expand the
commut
ihb f ihb f f f ihb f

k
25
rf f r
use 31 sinc n 2 and sinc f is of order 2 it follow from 32 that r is bound uniformli in
s and a now we observ that all the term in the expans 25 except the lead term k 1 are
remaind in particular
f k bk f bk
f k
f const f1
26
where f1 is a common upper bound for f 2 f and f k 2 which satisfi the hypothesi for f the last
term in 25 is estim use the oper inequ
p q q p p p q q

1
for q s 2 1 f p sn 2 1 r with the result
sn rf f r s1 f s2n1 r
2
27
therefor it remain to consid the lead term k 1 in 25 which is rewritten as
s1 f b1 f f b1 f s1 v 2 b1 u2 u2 b1 v 2
by factor f u2 f v 2 sinc u is of order 1 it follow from 32 that b1 u const s1
uniformli in a and similarli for b1 v as in 26 thi lead to the form estim
s1 v 2 b1 u2 uvb1 uv s1 vb1 uuv vv b1 u2
const s2 v 2 u2 v 2 u4 const s2 f1 as
5
where f1 share the properti of f u4 note that v is of lower order than u sinc the same estim
hold with u and v interchang we conclud that
s1 f b1 f f b1 f 2s1 uv b1 uv
plu a remaind 23 now follow sinc f 2f f 2uv2
to complet the proof of lemma 21 we multipli 23 from both side with gh ghgh where
g c0 is real and g 1 on suppg we also adjust the function b in 22 such that b 1 on suppg
multipli 16 by gh from both side we obtain the mourr inequ
ghb1 gh ghih agh g2 h
28
abbrevi gh g and f as 12 j we show that
s1 gjbjg s1 jgbgj s1 jgbj g g jbgj g jbj g

where in each case c stand for some oper which is bound uniformli in a and s by the same argument
as in 26 and 27 these term have correspond upper and lower bound

for ani bound b b we therefor obtain

mean that the differ of the two expresss is a remaind 24 for b b1 ihb a we use
mourr inequ 28 to obtain from 23
g ih f g

with remaind aris from 23 and twice from 210 multipli from both side with gh remov
gh and lead directli to 21
proof of theorem 11 we prove a slightli stronger version of 111 which will serv later in the proof
of theorem 12 let
at s1 a a t
and suppos that f is a posit c function of order 12 on r with f 0 and f x 0 for x 0
instead of 111 we show under the same hypothesi that
f at eiht gh a a const sm
211
for m n 1 uniformli in 0 t s and in a r 111 then follow by set t s and by observ
that sinc s1 a a f s1 a a for some f of the requir type to prove 211
we consid the oper
s t ghf at gh f f 2
and the evolut
t eiht a a h
212
then the estim 211 to be prove read

215 and lemma 21
dt s t s1 ghf1 ast gh const s2n1 g 2 h

218
as an induct assumpt suppos that 213 hold for some m n 1 sinc f1 also satisfi the
hypothesi for f it then follow from 218 that

dt s t t const

and again by integr over t

uniformli in 0 t s and in a r recal that 1 the best decay for s is obtain by set
min 1 n 1 m
which boost the expon m in 213 to m m 2 therefor 213 hold for ani m n 1
proof of theorem 12 it suffic to prove that
t2 x2 2t1 a eiht gh a a const tm
219
if is a smooth characterist function of for some 0 x 1 for larg neg x 0
and x 0 for x follow the line of the previou proof we consid the oper

we arriv at

224
now we use to estim

find

on the other hand it follow from 211 by set t s that
