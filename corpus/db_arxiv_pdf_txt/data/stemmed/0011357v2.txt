to gener small neutrino mass radi the zeemodel introduc two
higg doublet and one weaksinglet charg higg boson to it higg sector
from analyz the renorm group equat we determin the possibl rang of the lightest cpeven higg boson h mass and the higg boson
selfcoupl as a function of the cutoff scale beyond which either some of
the coupl constant are strong enough to invalid the perturb analysi or the stabil of the electroweak vacuum is no longer guarante use
the result obtain from the abov analysi we find that the singlet charg
higg boson can significantli modifi the partial decay width of h via
radi correct and it collid phenomenolog can also be drastic
differ from that of the charg higg boson in the usual twohiggsdoublet

i introduct
from the atmospher and solar neutrino data there is increas evid for neutrino
oscil 1 if thi is a correct interpret the standard model sm ha to be
extend to incorpor the small mass of the neutrino suggest by data there have
been sever idea propos in literatur to gener small neutrino mass the zeemodel
is one of such attempt 26 in thi model all flavor neutrino are massless at the tree
level and their small mass are induc radi through oneloop diagram for such a
massgener mechan to work it is necessari to extend the higg sector of the sm to
contain at least two weakdoublet field and one weaksinglet charg scalar field although
some studi have been done to examin the interact of the lepton and the higg boson
in the zeemodel 7 the scalar higg sector of the model remain unexplor in detail
in thi paper we studi the higg sector of the zeemodel to clarifi it impact on the higg
search experi either at the cern lepii the runii of the fermilab tevatron the
cern larg hadron collid lhc or futur linear collid lc
experiment search for the higg boson ha been continu at the cern lep and the
fermilab tevatron experi in the lepii experi the higg boson with the mass
less than about 110 gev ha been exclud if it product cross section and decay mode
are similar to those of the sm higg boson 8 runii of the tevatron can be sensit to
a smlike higg boson with the mass up to about 180 gev provid that the integr
luminos of the collid is larg enough about 30 fb1 9 furthermor the primari goal
of the cern lhc experi is to guarante the discoveri of a smlike higg boson for it
mass as larg as about 1 tev 10 which is the upper bound of the sm higg boson mass
for a higg boson mass beyond thi valu the sm is no longer a consist low energi
theori
when the higg boson is discov it mass and variou decay properti will be measur to test the sm and to distinguish model of new physic at high energi scale for
exampl the allow mass rang of the lightest cpeven higg boson h can be determin
3
by demand the consid theori to be a valid effect theori all the way up to some
cutoff energi scale for 1019 gev ie the planck scale the lower and upper
bound of the sm higg boson mass are 137 gev and 175 gev respect 11 the
higg mass bound for the twohiggsdoubletmodel thdm were also investig 1213
with and without includ the softbreak term with respect to the discret symmetri
that protect the natur flavor conserv it wa found in ref 13 that the lower bound
of the lightest cpeven higg boson is about 100 gev in the decoupl regim where onli
one neutral higg boson is light as compar to the other physic state of higg boson
the higg sector of the zeemodel is similar to that of the thdm except for the exist
of an addit weaksinglet charg higg field so that the physic scalar boson includ
two cpeven one cpodd and two pair of charg higg boson in thi paper we shall
first determin the upper and lower bound for the lightest cpeven higg boson mass mh
as a function of the cutoff scale of the zeemodel use renorm group equat
rges1 we show that the upper and lower mass bound for h are almost the same as those
in the thdm we also studi the possibl rang of the higgsboson selfcoupl constant
at the electroweak scale as a function of by use these result we examin effect of the
addit loop contribut of the singlet charg higg boson to the partial decay width of
h we show that by take 1019 gev the deviat of the decay width from the
sm predict can be about 20 or nearli 10 for mh between 125 gev and 140 gev
when the mass of the isospin singlet charg higg boson is taken to be around 100 gev
the magnitud of the deviat becom larger for lower cutoff scale and smaller mass of
the singlet charg higg boson if we choos 104 gev and the singlet charg higg
boson mass to be 100 gev the posit deviat can be greater than 30 40 for
mh 125 gev 140 gev such a deviat from the sm predict could be test at the
1 for
the model with seesaw mechan for neutrino mass gener the higg mass bound ha
been studi as a function of cutoff scale in ref 14

lhc the e e lc and the option of lc 1517 we also discuss phenomenolog of the
singlet charg higg boson at present and futur collid experi which is found to be
complet differ from that of the ordinari thdmlike charg higg boson to detect
such a charg higg boson at lepii experi experimentalist have to search for their
data sampl with e or plu miss energi in contrast to the usual detect channel
either or cs decay mode
thi paper is organ as follow in sec ii we introduc the higg sector of the zeemodel and review the neutrino mass and mix in thi model which are consist with
the atmospher and solar neutrino observ numer result on the possibl rang
of the mass and coupl constant of the higg boson are given in sec iii in sec iv we
discuss the oneloop effect of the extrahigg boson in the zeemodel to the partial decay
width of h and it impact on the neutral higgsboson search at highenergi collid
the phenomenolog of the charg higg boson that come from the addit singlet field
is discuss in sec v in sec vi we present addit discuss and conclus relev
rge for the zeemodel are given in the appendix

the phenomenolog analysi of the abov mass matrix wa given in ref 45 it wa
conclud that in the zeemodel the bimaxim mix solut is the onli possibl to
reconcil the atmospher and the solar neutrino data here we give a brief summari of their
result for complet let us denot the three eigenvalu for the neutrino mass matrix
cf eq 19 as m1 m2 and m3 which satisfi m1 m2 m3 0 the possibl pattern
of the neutrino mass spectrum which is allow in the zeemodel is m1 m2 m3

s1 is rather heavi and the lighter charg higg boson s2 is almost a weak singlet ie the
mix angl approach to zero it is unlik that there are observ effect to the low

the rare decay of e the univers of w boson decay into electron muon or tau
and the decay width of z boson when fij are small we do not expect a larg rate in the
lepton flavor violat decay of a light neutral higg boson such as h e the largest
one h e or h the smallest one on the contrari as to be discuss in
section iv the decay width of h can significantli deviat from the sm valu

thi mean that the fij cannot be o1 unless the charg higg boson mass are at the
order of 10 tev
iii higg boson mass and coupl through rge
in thi section we determin the bound on the mass of the lightest cpeven higg boson
as a function of the cutoff scale of the zeemodel by analyz the set of renorm
group equat rge we also studi the allow rang of the coupl constant
especi 1 and 2 in eq 4 in sec iv they will be use to evalu how much the
partial decay width of h can deviat from it sm valu due to the oneloop contribut
from the singlet charg higg boson
the mass bound are determin in the follow manner for each set of paramet
defin at the electroweak scale the run coupl constant are calcul numer
11
through rge at the oneloop level we requir that all the dimensionless coupl constant do not blow up below a given cutoff scale and the coupl constant satisfi the
vacuum stabil condit we vari the input paramet at the electroweak scale and
determin the possibl rang of the lightest cpeven higg boson mass as a function of
in a similar manner we also studi the allow rang of variou higg boson selfcoupl
constant at the electroweak scale as well as a function of the lightest cpeven higg boson
mass
we deriv the oneloop rge for the zeemodel and list them in the appendix for
refer for simplic in the rge we have neglect all the yukawa coupl constant
yu yd ye but the top yukawa coupl yt 6 although we kept the new coupl constant
fij in the rge list in the appendix we have neglect fij in the numer calcul
thi is becaus the magnitud of these coupl constant are numer too small to
affect the final result unless the singletcharg scalarboson mass is larger than a few tev
cf eq 25 the dimensionless coupl constant relev to our numer analysi are
the three gaugecoupl constant g1 g2 g3 the top yukawacoupl constant yt and eight
scalar selfcoupl constant i i 1 5 and i i 1 3 there are five dimens
paramet in the higg potenti name m21 m22 m23 m20 and instead of m21 m22 m23
we take v tan and m 2 m23 sin co as independ paramet where v 246
gev character the weak scale and m the softbreak scale of the discret symmetri
in the actual numer calcul we first fix tan and m for a given mass mh of
the lightest cpeven higg boson we solv one of the i which is chosen to be 3 here
in term of other i we then numer evalu all dimensionless coupl constant
accord to the rge from mh to m we use the sm rge which are match to the

in addit to the abov condit we also demand local stabil of the potenti at the
electroweak scale name we calcul the mass spectrum of all scalar field at the extremum
of the potenti and demand that all eigenvalu of the squar scalar mass are posit we
scan the remain sevendimension space of i and i and examin whether a given mass
of the lightest cpeven higg boson is allow under the abov condit in thi way we
obtain the allow rang of mh as a function of tan and m for each valu of the cutoff
scale
first we discuss our result in the decoupl case in which the softbreak scale m
is much larger than the electroweak scale v and the mass of all the higg boson but
h and s2 are at the order of m 8 in fig 2 the allow rang of mh is shown as a
function of tan for m 1000 gev we take the pole mass of top quark mt 175 gev

the decoupl regim m which lead to

and 0 the mass of h and
s2 are domin by the 11 compon of the mass matrix in eq 7 and the 22 compon of
that in eq 9 respect the mass of h is determin by the selfcoupl constant i while
that of s2 depend not onli on the selfcoupl constant i but also on the free mass paramet

of tan except for small tan region the upper bound of mh is about 175 gev and the
lower bound is between 110 gev and 120 gev for the cutoff scale to be near the planck
scale the numer valu in thi figur are veri close to those in the correspond figur
for the thdm discuss in ref 13 compar to the correspond lower mass bound in
the sm which is 145 gev when use the oneloop rge the lower mass bound in thi
model is reduc by about 30 gev to 40 gev the reason is similar to the thdm case the
lightest cpeven higg boson mass is essenti determin by the valu of 2 for tan to
the mass of s2 is smaller than m the effect of s2 on the mass bound of h is expect to be small
becaus at the oneloop level the primari effect is through the run of g1 whose contribut

a differ mass rang for the lightest cpeven higg boson as compar to the sm higg
boson for a given cutoff scale
next we show our result for m to be around v in fig 3 we present the mh bound for
m 100 gev in thi case the allow rang of mh is reduc as compar to that in the
decoupl case and lie around mh m for larg tan notic that we have not includ

tan cannot be too larg to ignor the contribut of the bottom quark in the case

16
phenomenolog constraint from the b s paramet and the direct higg boson
search experi at lep as mention befor the mass bound obtain from the rge
analysi are the same for the typei and typeii model without these phenomenolog
constraint howev it wa shown in ref 13 that the b s data can put a strong
200400 gev in the
constraint on the allow rang of the higg boson mass for m
typeii thdm wherea there is no appreci effect in the typei model thi is becaus a
small m impli a light charg higg boson in the thdm which can induc a larg decay
branch ratio for b s in the typeii model 1910 we expect a similar constraint from
the b s data on the typeii zeemodel when m is small
in fig 4 we show the upper and lower bound of mh as a function of m for variou
valu of for given m we scan the rang of tan for 1 tan 16 2 226 we
find that the obtain mh bound are almost the same as those for the thdm the primari
reason for thi is that the new coupl constant 1 2 and 3 do not appear directli in
the mass formula for mh and therefor do not induc larg effect on the bound of mh

iv twophoton decay width of the neutral higg boson
in thi section we studi the phenomenolog consequ of the higg boson mass and
the higgsbosoncoupl constant deriv in the previou section the import featur
of the higg sector of the zeemodel is that there are an addit weak doublet and a
singlet charg higg boson the physic state of the higg particl are two cpeven
higg boson one cpodd higg boson and two pair of charg higg boson therefor
the higg phenomenolog is quit close to the ordinari twohiggsdoublet model one
uniqu differ is the exist of the addit weaksinglet charg higg boson the
effect of thi extra charg higg boson is especi import when m is much larger
than the z boson mass ie in the decoupl regim in such a case the heavier cpeven
higg boson the cpodd higg boson as well as one of the charg higg boson have
mass approxim equal to m and these heavi state are decoupl from low energi
observ note that the condit on the applic of the perturb theori forbid
too larg selfcoupl among the higg boson henc in the limit of larg m the heavi
higg boson decoupl from the low energi effect theori the remain light state
are the lighter cpeven higg boson h and the lighter charg higg boson s2 which mainli
come from the weaksinglet in the previou section we show that even in the decoupl
case there can be larg differ in the allow rang of mh between the zeemodel and the
sm similarli we expect that even in the decoupl case the presenc of the addit
weaksinglet charg higg boson can give rise to interest higg phenomenolog
sinc the lighter charg higg boson s2 can coupl to higg boson and lepton it can
affect the decay and the product of the neutral higg boson at collid through radi
correct in the follow we consid the decay width of h as an exampl for
a sm higg boson the partial decay width or branch ratio of h is small 92
kev or 22 103 for mh 125 gev and 154 kev or 19 103 for mh 140 gev
with a 175 gev top quark nevertheless it is an import discoveri mode of the higg
boson at the lhc experi for mh less than twice of the w boson mass needless to
24
say that a chang in the branch ratio of h would lead to a differ product
rate of pp hx x at futur e e lc the branch ratio of h can be
determin via the reaction e e qq and e e with a 1622 accuraci 16
at the photonphoton collis option of the futur lc the partial decay width of h
can be precis test within a 2 accuraci 17 by measur the inclus product
rate of the higg boson h clearli a chang in the partial decay width of h will
lead to a differ product rate for h in the zeemodel such a chang is expect after
take into account the loop contribut of the extra charg higg boson we find that
the deviat from the sm predict can be sizabl and therefor testabl at the lhc and
futur lc
the partial decay width of h is calcul at the oneloop order similar to our
previou discuss we limit ourselv to the paramet space in which 1 tan 16 2
and keep onli the top quark contribut from the fermion loop diagram includ the
loop contribut from the w boson and the charg higg boson s1 and s2 togeth with
the top quark loop contribut we obtain 21

and both the topquark and the w boson loop contribut reduc to their sm valu we
like to stress that the weaksinglet higg boson doe not directli coupl to the quark field
in the limit of 0 therefor it doe not affect the decay rate of b s at the oneloop
order similarli be a weak singlet it also give no contribut to the paramet
henc the lowenergi constraint from either the b s decay or the paramet on the
zeemodel in the limit of 0 is similar to effect of that on the thdm let us examin
at the oneloop effect of the weaksinglet charg higg boson on the decay width of h

illustr the possibl size of the differ between the total width of the lightest cpeven
higg boson h in the zeemodel and that of the sm higg boson11 clearli the impact of
the s2 s2 decay channel is especi larg in the small mh region we note that total

that of a coupl of per cent if mh 2mz 23 mz is the mass of the zboson henc
measur the total width of the lightest neutral higg boson can provid a further test
of the zeemodel for mh 2ms2 the chang in the total width also modifi the decay
branch ratio of h zz henc yield a differ rate of h zz for a
given mh in the sm the branch ratio of h zz is about 13 for mh 200 gev
needless to say that for mh 2ms2 the product mode of h s2 s2 et is also
use to test the zeemodel further discuss on thi possibl will be given in sec vi

charg higg field and the singlet higg field respect the case with 0 occur
in the limit of m 2 v 2 2 and m20 ie in the decoupl limit the detect of s2 can
be a clear indic of the zeemodel as to be shown later it phenomenolog is found to
be drastic differ from that of the thdmlike charg higg boson s1 24 here we
discuss how the effect of thi extra charg boson can be explor experiment we first

where we have use the relat given in eq 23 and 24 clearli the branch ratio

differ from the case of detect the ordinari thdmlike charg higg boson which
preferenti decay into heavi fermion pair eg and cs instead of studi the
c mode the e c and c mode can provid a strong constraint on the mass of
s2 in fact the branch ratio of s2 e et or et is almost 100 so that we have
e e s2 s2 et e e s2 s2 where and repres e or not
let us compar thi with the cross section e e w w et e e
w w bw et 2 where bw et bw e et bw et
21 as seen in fig 13 the cross section e e s2 s2 et is compar with
e e w w et therefor by examin the lepii data for et
where e e e or in contrast to for the s1 case the experiment
lower bound on the mass of s2 can be determin such a bound can be induc from
the smuon search result at the lep experi 2526 in the case that neutralino are
assum to be massless from the et data accumul up to s 202 gev 26
we find that the lower mass bound of s2 is like to be 8085 gev for the 0 case
we note that the righthand smuon

in the thdm the total decay width of the charg higg boson h for mh 100 gev
is about 470 kev henc if the mix angl is not so small the decay pattern of s2 is
domin by that of the thdm charg higg boson h in fig 16 we plot the branch
ratio bs2 et as a function of sin at ms2 100 gev for sever valu of f12 we
onli show the case with tan 1 where the result is independ of the type of the yukawa
interact the coupl constant f12 is taken to be 3 9 18 and 36 104 which satisfi
the phenomenolog constraint given in sec ii as expect the branch ratio decreas
as increas when f12 36 104 bs2 et is smaller than 10 for sin 089
36
for the smaller f12 valu the branch ratio reduc more quickli the branch ratio is
not sensit to ms2 unless the mass exce the threshold of the decay into a tb or h0 w
pair abov the threshold of the tb pair product the decay rate of s2 tb is larg due
to the larg mass of the top quark so that bs2 et is substanti onli for veri
small valu of final while the decay branch ratio can chang drastic depend
on the mix angl the product cross section for e e s2 s2 remain unchang
in conclus the process e e s2 s2 et can also be use for test the
zeemodel in the nonzero case provid sin is not too larg
vi discuss and conclus
in thi paper the higg sector of the zeemodel ha been investig in which neutrino
mass are gener radi thi model contain extra weakdoublet higg field and
singlet charg higg field
we have studi indirect effect of these extra higg boson on the theoret mass
bound of the lightest cpeven higg boson which are obtain from the requir that
the run coupl constant neither blow up to a veri larg valu nor fall down to a
neg valu up to a highenergi cutoff scale for 1019 gev the upper bound
of mh is found to be about 175 gev which is almost the same valu as the sm predict
in the decoupl regim m mz the lower bound is found to be about 100 gev for
1019 gev which is much smaller than the lower bound in the sm and is almost the
same as that in the thdm for smaller valu the bound are more relax similar
to that of the sm we have also investig the allow rang of the coupl constant
relev to the weaksinglet higg field
the most strike featur of the zeemodel higg sector is the exist of the weaksinglet charg higg boson we have examin the possibl impact of the singlet chargedhigg boson on the neutral higg boson search through radi correct we found
that it oneloop contribut to the h width can be sizabl in the allow rang
37
of the coupl constant the deviat from the sm predict for thi decay width can be
about 20 or near 10 for ms2 100 gev and 1019 gev depend on the sign
of the coupl constant i the magnitud of the deviat is larger for lower valu
or for smaller ms2 valu for exampl a posit deviat over 3040 is possibl for
mh 125140 gev ms2 100 gev and 104 gev
in the decoupl limit ie when m 2 v 2 where 2 and 0 we
expect that the product cross section for gg h e e h and e e z 0 h in
the zeemodel are the same as those in the sm howev a sizabl chang in the decay
branch ratio of h can alter the product rate of pp hx x at the
lhc where thi product rate can be determin with a rel error of 1015 15
also such a deviat in the branch ratio of h directli affect the cross section
of e e h andz 0 h which can be measur with an accuraci of 1622
at the futur e e lc with s 500 gev and the integr luminos of 1 ab1 16
therefor the zeemodel with low cutoff scale can be test through the h process at
the lhc and the e e lc at the futur photon collid the enhanc or reduct
of the h partial decay rate will manifest itself in the differ product rate of h
from the sm predict a few per cent of the deviat in h bh bb can be
detect at a photon collid 17 so that the effect of the singlet charg higg boson can
be test even if the cutoff scale is at the planck scale
the collid phenomenolog of the singlet charg higg boson ha turn out to be
complet differ from that of the thdmlike charg higg boson the singlet charg
higg boson mainli decay into et with e or while the decay mode et
is almost neglig due to the relat f12 f13 f23 thi hierarchi among the
coupl constant fij result from demand bimaxim mix in the neutrino mass
matrix gener in the zeemodel to be consist with the neutrino oscil data on
the other hand the thdmlike charg higg boson decay mainli into either the mode
or the cs mode through the usual yukawainteract henc to probe thi singlet charg
higg boson use the lepii data experimentalist should examin their data sampl with
38
e e et e et e et or et while the experiment lower mass bound of the
thdmlike charg higg boson is obtain from examin the et et jj and jjjj
event use the publish lepii constraint on the mssm smuon product assum
the lightest neutralino to be massless we estim the current lower mass bound of thi
singlet charg higg boson to be about 8085 gev the tevatron runii lhc and futur
lc can further test thi model
final we comment on a case in which the singlet charg higg boson s2 for 0
is the lightest of all the higg boson for mh 2 ms2 mz the higg sector of the
zeemodel can be further test by measur the product rate of pp or pp hx
s2 s2 x et x the branch ratio for h s2 s2 et can be larg for
instanc for mh 210 gev and ms2 100 gev thi branch ratio is about 12 for
each e e e e or the branch ratio decreas for larger mass
of h moreov the total decay width of h can be larg modifi when the decay channel
h s2 s2 is open in thi case the decay branch ratio of h w w zz are also
differ from the sm predict
in conclus the distinguish featur of the zeemodel from the sm and the thdm
can be test by the data from lepii the tevatron runii and futur experi at lhc
and lc
