spectral decomposit for the evolut oper on an energi shell in phase space are construct for the free motion on

introduct
the dynam of a hamiltonian system can either be describ in term of
the trajectori x0 xt ut x0 in the phase space or by specifi the
t the
law of evolut of a function x on the phase space u
evolut oper ut which advanc a function along the trajectori is
defin by
t x ut x xt
u
quantum mechan ha a natur relat to the trajectori base
approach through feynman path integr in the semiclass limit
the path integr can be approxim by the saddl point contribut
which turn out to be the classic orbit and lead to the gutzwil
trace formula 1 for the green function of the quantum mechan
hamiltonian thi is a use tool for studi such problem as the
quantum energi level correl but it requir knowledg of the long
period orbit in order to obtain the correl at small energi differ 2 3 the situat is particularli bad in chaotic system where
the period orbit prolifer exponenti with length in practic some
uncontrol approxim about correl of action for differ
period orbit are made to get the analyt result
in contrast the flow base approach seem suitabl for studi the
behavior of chaotic system at long time when due to the decay of correl the dynam becom trivial to use thi approach in quantum
1
chao two problem howev need to be overcom first it is unclear how
to relat the quantum mechan to the evolut oper sinc there is
no analogu of the feynman path integr second one need to be abl
to calcul variou properti of the evolut oper which are natut in decay
ralli formul in term of the spectral decomposit of u
eigenmod
the first problem ha recent been address in 4 5 where it ha
been conjectur that the suitabl averag correl function of the
quantum energi level andor quantum eigenfunct can be gener
from an effect action of nonlinear model type involv the liouvil

for thi approach come from the well develop theori of weakli disord metal where the disord averag properti of an ensembl of
macroscop ident system are calcul use a similar model
with a diffus oper instead of the liouvillian one see 6 7 for a
detail discuss of the diffus case

h over s we denot by f the valu of the linear function f s on

a vector g h may be natur embed in s as g g so

surfac of constant neg curvatur
we will use the resolv method describ in the previou section to
obtain a spectral decomposit for the evolut oper of a model
chaotic system the simplest system which are strongli chaotic and in
particular mix are the free motion on compact 2d surfac of constant
neg curvatur
the hyperbol plane n play the role of a univers cover for these
surfac it can be embed in minkowski space where the metric is
ds2 dx21 dx22 dx23
as the surfac satisfi the equat
x21 x22 x23 1
we shall consid the free motion on compactif of n form by
quotient it under the action of some discret group as describ below
we start by analyz the free motion of a particl on the hyperbol
plane itself thi dynam system ha the phase space t n and is
p2
which is just the kinet energi
describ by the hamiltonian h 2m
of the particl the trajectori for thi dynam system are given by
the geodes of the surfac n for a particl with unit mass m 1 the
constant energi surfac m with energi e 12 consist of the point with
momenta of unit modulu and henc also unit speed thu the energi
shell m is the unit cotang bundl of the hyperbol plane chang
the energi amount to a rescal which leav the trajectori unchang
and onli alter the rate at which they are travers
8
the group of isometri of the hyperbol plane g so2 1 act
simpli transit on the point of the energi shell let us take as a
base point in m the point o q p where the posit q is given by
0 0 1 and the momentum p is 1 0 0 a point x on the energi shell
may be identifi with the uniqu element of g which take o to x go
in thi way the constant energi shell can be identifi with the element
of g the abov construct give a diffeomorph from the topolog
group g to the energi shell m
we choos a basi for the lie algebra g of g consist of the matric
0 1 0

p 1 0 0 q 0 0 0 k 0 0 1

the paramet and are known as the euler angl note that
and give the posit in polar coordin
x1 x2 x3 cosh sinh co sinh sin
while the angl give a consist way of parameter the direct
of the momentum
after a time t a free particl at the point o on the constant energi
surfac advanc along the geodes to which it belong to the point ht o
where ht ep t the point go move to ght o henc on identifi m
with g the evolut correspond to right multipl by the element
ht thi 1paramet group of transform
g ut g ght
is the geodes flow on g the measur on m which is invari under
the geodes flow ut is the haar measur dg of the group g thi measur
is invari under right and left multipl by element of the group
the ut invari scalar product for function on g is therefor given by

final we notic that right multipl by element in the rotat
subgroup h ek onli affect the direct of momentum and doe
not chang the posit of the particl therefor we can identifi the
hyperbol plane n with the set of right coset gh
9
we now turn to the free motion on gener surfac of constant neg curvatur which are construct by take a tessel of the hyperbol plane gh and identifi the tessel shape the fundament
domain let be the group of transform map the tessel shape to each other for everi the point gh and gh of
the hyperbol plane are identifi the point of the quotient surfac
form under thi identif are label by doubl coset in gh
when the direct of momentum at each of the point are includ the
constant energi surfac m g is form sinc the free motion is
given by the right shift by ht it is not affect by quotient on the left
by the subgroup so on the constant energi surfac g the geodes
flow is given by

decomposit of the evolut oper
for the geodes flow
in thi section we use the represent theori of g so2 1 to find
a decomposit of the form 7 for the resolv for the geodes flow on
g
the right regular represent tr h of g on l2 g is defin by
tr hg gh where l2 g
it can be decompos as a direct sum of irreduc unitari represent t y which lead to a split of l2 g into a direct sum of the
space ht y on which t y act
l2 g ht y

as the geodes flow ut defin in 19 amount to right multipl

by the group element ht the evolut oper u

irreduc represent of so2 1
let t be an arbitrari unitari represent of g so2 1 on the
hilbert space ht with scalar product
the casimir oper is
defin on ht by
t l2p t l2q t l2k t
where lx t is the lie deriv of t in the direct x g and
p q k g are as defin in 17 thi oper commut with each of
the t g 15 and therefor must be a scalar multipl of the ident on
each of the irreduc represent t y it is conveni to denot by

let n ht be a vector in one such onedimension represent
with

24
it is a fact 16 that in a represent t there is at most one vector
n for each valu n and they can be normal to form an orthonorm
basi for the space ht we also use the notat n when the
irreduc represent to which n belong need to be specifi for
the represent of the princip and complimentari seri the valu of

consequ for the ballist model

where w x belong to some supergroup and is a particular matrix
in thi group obey 2 1 the detail structur of the target space
is somewhat involv and for the purpos of our discuss it suffic to
consid a toy model with w su 2 and diag1 1 then the
target space is a twodimension sphere s 2 su 2u 1 parametr
by the matric q w 1 w the action 44 doe not depend on the
parametr of s 2 in term of w inde introduc the twoform

where pdq is the antideriv of the simplect structur dp dq if q v
is exact and it is certainli close the first term doe not depend on the
choic of the antideriv but onli on the simplect structur dp dq
it is univers believ that some sort of regular should supplement the effect action 44 it wa conjectur 5 that in the limit of
a vanish regul the eigenvalu of the regular liouvillian oper approach the ruell reson which were refer to as eigenvalu
of the perron frobeniu oper in 5
we would like to point out that thi conjectur must be further clarifi due to the exist of the two inequival set of ruell reson
one set of reson is in the left half of the complex plane while the
other is in the right these two set origin from the differ branch
of the resolv given by the two integr represent equat 6
and 15 respect as a result there exist two nonequival regu denot by lreg the regular of l
lariz of the oper l
with eigenvalu close to the ruell reson in the left half plane and
observ that the oper l
reg ha the eigenvalu close to the ruell
reson in the right half plane we suggest that the two regular
of l are lreg and l
reg
we suggest the follow structur for the regular oper in the
target space
