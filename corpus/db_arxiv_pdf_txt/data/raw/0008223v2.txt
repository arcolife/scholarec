Introduction

A Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra is a vector space with a Lie algebra structure and a Novikov
algebra structure, satisfying a certain compatibility condition. This bialgebraic structure
corresponds to a certain Hamiltonian pairs in the Gel’fand-Dikii-Dorfman’s theory of Hamiltonian operators (cf. [GDi], [GDo]). In this talk, I will give a survey on the study of
Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebras. First let me give a more technical initial introduction to the
bialgebras through what I call “Lie algebra with one-variable structure.”
Let F be an arbitrary field. Denote by Z the ring of integers and by N the additive
semi-group of nonnegative integers. All the vector spaces are assumed over F. Let V be a
vector space and let t be an indeterminant. Form a tensor
Vˆ = V ⊗F F[t, t−1 ].

(1.1)

(u ⊗ tn )z −n−1

(1.2)

We denote
u(z) =

for u ∈ V,

nZ

where z is a formal variable. A Lie algebra with one-variable structure is a vector space Vˆ
with the Lie bracket of the form
m

z2−1 ∂zi 1 δ

[u(z1 ), v(z2 )] =
i=0 j=0

z1
z2

∂zj2 wij (z2 )

(1.3)

for u, v ∈ V , where m, n are nonnegative integers depending on u, v, and wij ∈ V . Here we
have used the notation
zk .

δ(z) =

(1.4)

k∈Z

Moreover, each wij depends on u and v bilinearly by (1.2) and (1.3). Above definition is
not in general form. We aim at giving the audience a simple rough picture. According
to Wightman’s axioms of quantum field theory, the algebraic content of two-dimensional
quantum field theory is a certain representation theory of Lie algebras with one-variable
structure (e.g., cf. [K]), where intertwining operators among irreducible modules, “partition

functions” (characters in algebraic terms) and “correlation functions” related to (1.3) etc.
play important roles.
Suppose that m = n = 0 in (1.3). We denote
w00 = [u, v].

(1.5)

Then (V, [u, v]) forms a Lie algebra and Vˆ is the corresponding loop algebra with the Lie
bracket
[u ⊗ tj , v ⊗ tk ] = [u, v] ⊗ tj+k

for u, v ∈ V, j, k ∈ Z.

(1.6)

If V = Fe is one-dimensional and
[e(z1 ), e(z2 )] = z2−1 δ

z1
z2

∂z2 e(z2 ) − 2z2−1 ∂z1 δ

z1
z2

e(z2 ),

(1.7)

Then Vˆ is the centerless Virasoro algebra (or a rank-one Witt algebra) with the Lie bracket
[e ⊗ tj , e ⊗ tk ] = (j − k)e ⊗ tj+k

for j, k ∈ Z.

(1.8)

A natural generalization of the above one-dimensional case is
[u(z1 ), v(z2 )] = z2−1 δ

z1
z2

∂z2 w01 (z2 ) + z2−1 ∂z1 δ

w10 (z2 )

(1.9)

for u, v ∈ V . Denote
w01 = v ◦ u.

(1.10)

(u ◦ v) ◦ w = (u ◦ w) ◦ v,

(1.11)

(u ◦ v) ◦ w − u ◦ (v ◦ w) = (v ◦ u) ◦ w − v ◦ (u ◦ w)

(1.12)

Then (V, ◦) is an algebra satisfying

for u, v, w ∈ V. The above algebra (V, ◦) appeared in Gel’fand and Dorfman’s work [GDo],
corresponding to certain Hamiltonian operators. Moreover, it also appeared in Balinskii and
Novikov’s work [BN] as the local structures of certain Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type.
This structure was first abstractly studied by Zel’manov [Z], Filippov [F] and was named as
“Novikov algebra” by Osborn [O1].
Note that (1.12) is the axiom of left-symmetric algebra. Left-symmetric algebras play
fundamental roles in the theory of affine manifolds (cf. [A], [FD]). Novikov algebras are
Left-symmetric algebras whose right multiplication operators are mutually commutative (cf.
(1.11)). Furthermore,
w10 = −(u ◦ v + v ◦ u).

(1.13)

The Lie bracket on Vˆ is
[u ⊗ tj , v ⊗ tk ] = ju ◦ v ⊗ tj+k−1 − kv ◦ u ⊗ tj+k−1

for u, v ∈ V, j, k ∈ Z.

(1.14)

Consider the mixed case
[u(z1 ), v(z2 )] = z2−1 δ

z1
z2

[w00 (z2 ) + ∂z2 w01 (z2 )] + z2−1 ∂z1 δ

z1
z2

w10 (z2 )

(1.15)

for u, v ∈ V . Denote
w00 = [v, u],

w01 = v ◦ u.

(1.16)

Then (V, [·, ·]) forms a Lie algebra, (V, ◦) forms a Novikov algebra and the following compatibility condition holds
[w ◦ u, v] − [w ◦ v, u] + [w, u] ◦ v − [w, v] ◦ u − w ◦ [u, v] = 0

(1.17)

for u, v, w ∈ V .
I called the triple (V, [·, ·], ◦) a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra (cf. [X4]), which corresponds
to a certain Hamiltonian pair in Gel’fand and Dorfman’s work [GDo]. Moreover, (1.13) holds.
The Lie bracket on Vˆ is
[u ⊗ tj , v ⊗ tk ] = [v, u] ⊗ tj+k + ju ◦ v ⊗ tj+k−1 − kv ◦ u ⊗ tj+k−1

(1.18)

for u, v ∈ V, j, k ∈ Z.
For convenience, we shall use the following notation of index
m, n = {m, m + 1, ..., n}

(1.19)

for m, n ∈ N such that m ≤ n.
The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, I will talk about structures of simple
Novikov algebras and their irreducible representations. In Section 3, I will present some general constructions of Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebras. In Section 4, I will give a few classification
results on the bialgebras. In Section 5, examples of application to simple “cubic conformal
algebras” and “quartic conformal algebras” will be given.

Novikov Algebras

Let us first give a construction of Novikov algebras. Let (A, ·) be a commutative associative
algebra. Then (A, ·) forms a Novikov algebra, which is not so interesting. Take a derivation
∂ of (A, ·) and ξ ∈ A. We define
u ◦ξ v = u∂(v) + ξuv

for u, v ∈ A.

(2.1)

Then (A, ◦ξ ) forms a Novikov algebra. The above construction was found by S. Gel’fand
when ξ = 0 (cf. [GDo]), by Fillip [F] when ξ ∈ F and by me [X2] in general case.

Theorem 2.1 (Zel’manov [Z]). Any finite-dimensional simple Novikov algebra over an
algebraically closed field F with characteristic 0 isomorphic to (F, ·).
Based on Osborn’s work [O1], I obtained the following result:
Theorem 2.2 (Xu, [X1]). A finite-dimensional simple Novikov algebra over an algebraically closed field F with characteristic p > 2 is either one-dimensional with a base
element e such that e ◦ e = e or has dimension pk for some positive integer k with a basis
{ςj | j ∈ −1, pk − 2} satisfying
ςj1 ◦ ςj2 = ( j1 +jj22 +1 )ςj1 +j2 + δj1 ,−1 δj2 ,0 aςpk −2 + δj1 ,−1 δj2 ,−1 bςpk −2

(2.2)

for j1 , j2 ∈ −1, pk − 1, where a, b ∈ F are constants.
Next, we consider infinite-dimensional simple Novikov algebra with char F = 0. Let ∆ be
an additive subgroup of F and let F1 be an extension field of F. Take a map f : ∆ × ∆ →
F×
1 = F1 \ {0} such that
f (α, β) = f (β, α), f (α, β)f (α + β, γ) = f (α, β + γ)f (β, γ)

(2.3)

for α, β, γ ∈ ∆. Take J to be the additive semi-group {0} or N. Let A(∆, f, J) be a vector
space over F1 with a basis
{uα,i | α ∈ ∆, i ∈ N}.

(2.4)

We define an algebraic operation “·” on A(∆, f, J) by
uα,i · uβ,j = f (α, β)uα+β,i+j

for α, β ∈ ∆, i, j ∈ J.

(2.5)

Then (A(∆, f, J), ·) forms a commutative associative algebra over F1 , and also over F. We
define a derivation ∂ of A(∆, f, J) over F1 by
∂(uα,i ) = αuα,i + iuα,i−1

for α ∈ ∆, i ∈ J,

(2.6)

where we treat
uβ,j = 0

if (β, j) ∈ ∆ × J.

(2.7)

Note that ∂ is also a derivation of A(∆, f, J) over F.
Theorem 2.3 (Xu, [X2]). For any element ξ ∈ (A(∆, f, J), the Novikov algebra
(A(∆, f, J), ◦ξ ) (cf. (2.1)) is simple.
Osborn [O3] gave a classification of infinite-dimensional simple Novikov algebras with an
element e such that e◦e ∈ Fe, assuming the existence of generalized-eigenspace decomposition

with respect to its left multiplication operator. There are four fundamantal mistakes in
his classification. The first is using of Proposition 2.6 (d) in [O1] with β = 0, which was
misproved. The second is that the eigenspace A0 in Lemma 2.12 of [O3] does not form a
field when b = 0 with respect to the Novikov algebraic operation. The third is that A0 may
not be a perfect field when b = 0. The fourth is that the author forgot the case b = 0 and
∆ = {0} in Lemma 2.8. In addition to these four mistakes, there are gaps in the arguments of
classification in [O3]. It seems that one can not draw any conclusions of classification based
on the arguments in [O3].
A linear transformation T of a vector space V is called locally finite if the subspace
∞

FT m (v) is finite-dimensional for any v ∈ V.

(2.8)

m=0

An element u of a Novikov algebra N is called left locally finite if its left multiplication
operator Lu is locally finite.
I have re-established the following classification theorem:
Theorem 2.4 (Xu, [X6]) Let (N , ◦) be an infinite-dimensional simple Novikov algebra
over an algebraically field F with characteristic 0. Suppose that N contains a left locally finite
element e whose right multiplication Re is a constant map and left multiplication is surjective
if Re = 0. Then there exist an additive subgroup ∆ of F, an extension field F1 of F, a map
f : ∆ × ∆ → F×
1 satisfying (2.3) and ξ ∈ F such that the algebra (N , ◦) is isomorphic to
(A(∆, f, J), ◦ξ ).
Now we consider representations of a Novikov algebra. A module M of a Novikov algebras
(N , ◦) is a vector space with two linear maps
N × M → M : (u, w) → u ◦ w, M × N → M : (w, u) → w ◦ u

(2.9)

such that (1.11) and (1.12) hold when one of the elements in {u, v, w} is in M and the other
two are in N . The commutator algebra associated with a finite-dimensional simple Novikov
algebra over an algebraically closed field F with characteristic p > 2 is a rank-one simple Lie
algebra of Witt type (cf. [O1]), whose finite-dimensional irreducible modules has not been
completely classified yet. However, we have the following complete result.
Theorem 2.5 (Xu, [X1]). Suppose that F is an algebraically closed field with characteristic p > 2. If M is a finite-dimensional irreducible module of a finite-dimensional simple
Novikov algebra (N , ◦) in the presentation (2.2), then there exists a constant λ and a basis
{vj | j ∈ −1, pk − 2} of M such that
2 +1

ςj1 ◦ vj2 = ( j1 +j
)vj1 +j2 + ( j1j+j
)λvj1 +j2 +1 + δj1 ,−1 δj2 ,0 avpk −2

vj2 ◦ ςj1 = ( j1 +j
)vj1 +j2 + δj2 ,−1 δj1 ,0 avpk −2 + δj2 ,−1δj1 ,−1 bvpk −2
j1

(2.11)

for j1 , j2 ∈ −1, pk − 2. Moreover, λ = 0 if a = 0. Conversely, (2.10) and (2.11) define an
irreducible module for any 0 = λ ∈ F and for λ = 0 if a = 0.
Let us go to the case of char F = 0. First we shall give a construction of irreducible
modules. Take J to be the additive semi-group {0} or N. Let A be a vector space with a
basis
{uα,i | α ∈ F, i ∈ J}.

(2.12)

Define the operation “·” on A by
uα,i · uβ,j = uα+β,i+j

for α, β ∈ F, i, j ∈ J.

(2.13)

Then (A, ·) forms a commutative associative algebra with the identity element 1 = u0,0 .
We define the derivation ∂ on A by (2.6). Let ∆ be an additive subgroup of F such that
J + ∆ = {0}. Set
N =

Fuα,i .

(2.14)

α∈∆,i∈J

For any fixed element ξ ∈ N , we define the operation “◦” on A by
u ◦ v = u · ∂(v) + ξ · u · v

for u, v ∈ A.

(2.15)

By Theorem 2.3, (A, ◦) forms a simple Novikov algebra and (N , ◦) forms a simple subalgebra
of (A, ◦). For λ ∈ F, we set
M(λ) =

Fuα+λ,i

(2.16)

α∈∆,i∈J

Expression (2.15) shows
N ◦ M(λ), M(λ) ◦ N ⊂ M(λ).

(2.17)

Thus M(λ) forms an N -module. By the proof of Theorem 2.9 in [X2], we have
Theorem 2.6 (Xu, [X6]). The N -module M(λ) is irreducible.
A natural question is to what extent the modules {M(λ) | λ ∈ F} cover the irreducible
modules of N . Up to this point, we are not be able to answer this for a general element
ξ ∈ N . For an N -module M, we define the left action LM (u0,0 ) of u0,0 by
LM (u0,0 )(w) = u0,0 ◦ w

for w ∈ M.

(2.18)

Theorem 2.7 (Xu, [X6]). If ξ ∈ F, then any irreducible N -module M with locally finite
LM (u0,0) is isomorphic to M(λ) for some λ ∈ F, when F is algebraically closed.

Constructions of Gel’fand-Dorfman Bialgebras

Recall the compatibility condition (1.17). Let (N , ◦) be a Novikov algebra. Define
[u, v]− = u ◦ v − v ◦ u

for u, v ∈ N .

(3.1)

Theorem 3.1 (Gel’fand and Dorfman, [GDo]). The triple (N , [·, ·]− , ◦) forms a
Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra.
Let (A, ·) be a commutative associative algebra. Denote by Der A the Lie algebras of all
the derivations of A. Set
N = Der A ⊕ A.

(3.2)

We define two algebraic operation [·, ·] and ◦ on N by
[d1 + ξ1 , d2 + ξ2 ] = [d1 , d2 ] + d1 (ξ2 ) − d2 (ξ1 ),

(3.3)

(d1 + ξ1 ) ◦ (d2 + ξ2 ) = ξ2 (d1 + ξ1 )

(3.4)

for d1 , d2 ∈ Der A and ξ1 , ξ2 ∈ A.
Theorem 3.2 (Xu, [X4]). The triple (N , [·, ·], ◦) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra.
The above construction is extracted from the simple Lie algebras of Witt type.
Our second construction is related to the following concept. A Lie-Poisson algebra is a
vector space A with two algebraic operations “·” and [·, ·] such that (A, ·) forms a commutative
associative algebra, (A, [·, ·]) forms a Lie algebra and the following compatibility condition is
satisfied:
[u, v · w] = [u, v] · w + v · [u, w]

for u, v, w ∈ A.

(3.5)

Let (A, ·, [·, ·]) be a Lie-Poisson algebra and let ∂ be a derivation of the algebra (A, ·) such
that
∂[u, v] = [∂(u), v] + [u, ∂(v)] + ξ[u, v]

for u, v ∈ A,

(3.6)

where ξ ∈ F is a constant. Now we define another algebraic operation on ◦ on A by
u ◦ v = u∂(v) + ξuv

for u ∈ A, v ∈ A.

(3.7)

Theorem 3.3 (Xu, [X4]). The triple (A, [·, ·], ◦) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra.
The above construction is related to the Lie algebras of Hamiltonian type and Contact
type.
Let (A, ·) be a commutative associative algebra and let ∂1 , ∂2 be mutually commutative
derivations of (A, ·). Define algebraic operations on A by
[u, v] = ∂1 (u)∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)∂1 (v) + u∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)v, u ◦ v = u∂2 (v)

(3.8)

for u, v ∈ A.
Theorem 3.4 (Xu, [X4]). The triple (A, [·, ·], ◦) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra.
Let (A, ·), ∂1 and ∂2 be the same as in the above. For any constant b ∈ F, we define
[u, v] = ∂1 (u)∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)∂1 (v) + b(u∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)v), u ◦ v = u∂1 (v) + buv

(3.9)

for u, v ∈ A.
Theorem 3.5 (Xu, [X4]). The triple (A, [·, ·], ◦) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra.

Classifications of the Bialgebras

If (N , [·, ·], ◦) is a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra, then we say that (N , [·, ·]) is a Lie algebra
over the Novikov algebra (N , ◦). Similarly, (N , ◦) is a Novikov algebra over the Lie algebra
(N , [·, ·]).
Let F be an algebraically closed field with char F = 0. Take J to be the additive semigroup {0} or N and take an additive subgroup ∆ of F. Let A(∆, J) be a vector space with
a basis
{uα,i | α ∈ ∆, i ∈ J}.

(4.1)

For any constant b ∈ F, we define an algebraic operation ◦b on A(∆, J) by
u ◦b v = u · ∂(v) + b · u · v

for u, v ∈ A(∆, J).

(4.2)

By Theorem 2.3, (A(∆, J), ◦b ) forms a simple Novikov algebra.
Theorem 4.1 (Osborn and Zel’manov, [OZ]). If ∆ = Z, J = {0}, b ∈ Z or
∆ = 0, J = N, then any nontrivial Lie algebra over the Novikov algebra (A(∆, J), ◦b) is
isomorphic to (A(∆, J), [·, ·]− ), where
[uα,i , uβ,j ]− = (β − α)uα+β,i+j + (j − i)uα+β,i+j−1

(4.3)

for α, β ∈ ∆ and i, j ∈ J.
Theorem 4.2 (Xu, [X4]). If b ∈ ∆, then any Lie algebra over the Novikov algebra
(A(∆, J), ◦b) has the Lie bracket
[uα,i , uβ,j ] = [(α + b)ϕ(β) − (β + b)ϕ(α)]uα+β,i+j
+[i(ϕ(β) − λ(β + b)) + j(λ(α + b) − ϕ(α))]uα+β,i+j−1

(4.4)

for α, β ∈ ∆, i, j ∈ J, where ϕ : ∆ → F is an additive group homomorphism and λ ∈ F is a
constant.

When J = {0}, (4.4) gives a Block algebra (cf. [B]). Next we assume J = {0} and
redenote uα,0 by uα for α ∈ ∆.
Theorem 4.3 (Xu, [X4]) Any Lie algebra over the Novikov algebra (A(∆, {0}), ◦0) has
the Lie bracket
[uα , uβ ] = (φ(α, β) + a(β − α))uα+β

for α, β ∈ ∆,

(4.5)

where a is a constant and φ(·, ·) : ∆ × ∆ → F is a skew-symmetric map such that there exists
a symmetric map S0 (·, ·, ·) : ∆ × ∆ × ∆ → F satisfying
φ(β + γ, α) = φ(γ, α) + φ(β, α) + αS0 (α, β, γ),

(4.6)

(γφ(α, β) + αφ(β, γ) + βφ(γ, α))(S0(α, β, γ) − a) = 0.

(4.7)

for α, β, γ ∈ ∆. In particular, the following φ satisfies our condition: when a = 0, φ is any
skew-symmetric Z-bilinear form; when a = 0,
φ(α, β) = αϕ0 (β) − βϕ0 (α)

for α, β ∈ ∆,

(4.8)

where ϕ0 : ∆ → F is an additive group homomorphism.
Theorem 4.4 (Xu, [X4]) Suppose 0 = b ∈ ∆. Any Lie algebra over the Novikov algebra
(A(∆, {0}), ◦b) has the Lie bracket
[uα , uβ ] = θ(α, β)uα+β+b + ((α + b)ϕ(β) − (β + b)ϕ(α))uα+β

(4.9)

for α, β ∈ ∆, where ϕ : ∆ → F is additive group homomorphism, θ ≡ 0 if ϕ(b) = 0 and
θ : ∆ × ∆ → F is a skew-symmetric map satisfying
(α + b)(θ(α + γ, β) − θ(γ, β) − θ(α, β)) = (β + b)(θ(β + γ, α) − θ(γ, α) − θ(β, α))

(4.10)

and
θ(α, β)θ(α + β + b, γ) + θ(β, γ)θ(β + γ + b, α) + θ(γ, α)θ(γ + α + b, β) = 0

(4.11)

if ϕ(b) = 0. In particualr, we can take ϕ : ∆ → F to be any additive group homomorphism
such that ϕ(b) = 0 and take θ(·, ·)to be a skew-symmetric Z-bilinear map such that b ∈ Radθ
or
θ(α, β) = ϕ1 (α)ϕ2 (β) − ϕ1 (β)ϕ2(α)

for α, β ∈ ∆,

(4.12)

where ϕ1 , ϕ2 : ∆ → F are additive group homorphisms such that ϕ1 (b) = 0 and ϕ2 (b) = 0.
Theorem 4.5 (Xu, [X4]). If ◦ is a Novikov algebra operation on the space A(∆, {0})
such that
uα ◦ uβ − uβ ◦ uα = (β − α)uα+β

for α, β ∈ ∆,

(4.13)

then there exists an element ξ ∈ A(∆, {0}) such that
uα ◦ uβ = (β + ξ)uα+β

for α, β ∈ ∆.

(4.14)

Application to Cubic and Quartic Conformal Algebras

For two vector spaces V1 and V2 , we denote by LM(V1 , V2 ) the space of linear maps from V1
to V2 . We shall also use the following operator of taking residue:
Resz (z n ) = δn,−1

for n ∈ Z.

(5.1)

Furthermore, all the binomials are assumed to be expanded in the nonnegative powers of the
second variable. For example ,

In particular, the above equation implies
Resx

1
(
ξj z j ) =
z − x j∈Z

∞

ξ−j z −j .

(5.3)

j=1

So the operator Resx (1/(z − x))(—) is taking the part of negative powers in a formal series
and changing the variable x to z.
A conformal algebra R is an F[∂]-module equipped with a linear map Y + (·, z) : R →
LM(R, R[z −1 ]z −1 ) satisfying:
Y + (∂u, z) =

d +
ex∂ Y + (v, −x)u
Y (u, z), Y + (u, z)v = Resx

Y + (u, z1 )Y + (v, z2 ) − Y + (v, z2 )Y + (u, z1 ) = Resx

Y + (Y + (u, z1 − x)v, x)
z2 − x

(5.4)
(5.5)

for u, v ∈ R. We denote by (R, ∂, Y + (·, z)) a conformal algebra.
The above definition is the equivalent generating-function form to that given in [K], where
the author used the component formula with Y + (u, z) =

∞
n=0

u(n) z −n−1 /n!. The connection

between between the Lie algebra with one-variable structure in (1.3) and conformal algebra
is that R = F[∂] ⊗F V and

Y (u, z)v =

Conformal algebras are equivalent to linear Hamiltonian operators (cf. [X5]).

(5.6)

Suppose that (R, ∂, Y + (·, z)) is a conformal algebra that is a free F[∂]-module over a
subspace V , namely
R = F[∂]V (∼
= F[∂] ⊗F V ).

(5.7)

Let m be a positive integer. The algebra R is called of degree m if for any u, v ∈ V ,
∂ i wi,j z −j

Y + (u, z)v =

with wi,j ∈ V,

(5.8)

0<j;i+j≤m

and wm−j,j = 0 for some u, v ∈ V and j ∈ 1, m. A quadratic conformal algebra is a conformal
algebra of degree 2, a cubic conformal algebra is a conformal algebra of degree 3 and a
quartic conformal algebra is a conformal algebra of degree 4. In [X4], I have proved that a
quadratic conformal algebra is equivalent to a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra. Below I will give
the construction of quadratic conformal algebra from Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebras.
Let (N , [·, ·], ◦) be a Gel’fand Dorfman bialgebra. Set
RN = F[∂] ⊗F N .

(5.9)

So RN is a free F[∂]-module generated by N . For convenience, we identify N with 1 ⊗ N .
We define a linear map Y + (·, z) : R → LM(R, R[z −1 ]z −1 ) by

for u, v ∈ N and m, n ∈ N.
Theorem 5.1 (Xu, [X4]). The triple (RN , ∂, Y + (·, z)) forms a quadratic conformal
algebra.
Next I will use the above theorem to construct simple cubic conformal algebras and quartic
conformal algebras. A conformal algebra (R, ∂, Y + (·, z)) is called simple if there does not
exist a nonzero proper subspace I of R such that
Y + (u, z)(I) ⊂ I[z −1 ]

for u ∈ R.

(5.11)

Take J to be the additive semi-group {0} or N. Let Γ be an additive subgroup of F 2 such
that
(J, 0) + Γ ⊂ (0, F),

Γ ⊂ (F, 0).

Let A be the semi-group algebra of Γ × J with the canonical basis {uα,i | α ∈ ∆, i ∈ J},
that is,
uα,i · uβ,j = uα+β,i+j

for α, β ∈ Γ, i, j ∈ J.

(5.13)

Define two derivations ∂1 and ∂2 of A by
∂1 (uα,i ) = α1 uα,i + iuα,i−1 , ∂2 (uα,i ) = α2 uα,i

(5.14)

for α = (α1 , α2 ) ∈ Γ and i ∈ J.
First we define
[u, v]1 = ∂1 (u)∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)∂1 (v) + u∂2 (v) − ∂2 (u)v, u ◦1 v = u∂2 (v)

(5.15)

Then (A, [·, ·]1, ◦1 ) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra by Theorem 3.4. On RA , the structure
map (5.10) is determined by
Y1+ (uα,i , z)uβ,j = [((1 + α1 )β2 − α2 (1 + β1 ))uα+β,i+j + (iβ2 − jα2 )uα+β,i+j−1
+β2 ∂uα+β,i+j ]z −1 + (α2 + β2 )uα+β,i+j z −2 .

(5.16)

for α = (α1 , α2 ), β = (β1 , β2 ) ∈ Γ and i, j ∈ J. When β2 = −α2 , (5.16) becomes
Y1+ (uα,i , z)uβ,j = β2 [(α1 + β1 + 2 + ∂)uα+β,i+j + (i + j)uα+β,i+j−1]z −1 .

(5.17)

Set
R1 =

F[∂]uα,i +
α=(α1 ,α2 )∈Γ, α2 =0

F[∂][(β1 + 2 + ∂)uβ,j + juβ,j−1].

(5.18)

β=(β1 ,0)∈Γ, j∈J

Then R1 forms a subalgebra of (RA , ∂, Y1+ (·, z)) by (5.17), that is,
∂R1 ⊂ R1 , Y1+ (u, z)v ∈ R1 [z −1 ]

for u, v ∈ R1 .

(5.19)

Theorem 5.2 (Xu, [X7]). The conformal algebra (R1 , ∂, Y1+ (u, z)) is a simple cubic
conformal algebra.
Let A, ∂1 and ∂2 be the same as in the above. Take b ∈ F to be any fixed constant such
that
(F, 2b)

Γ = ∅,

Γ ⊂ (F, 0).

(5.20)

We define
[u, v]2 = ∂2 (u)∂1 (v) − ∂1 (u)∂2 (v) + b(u∂1 (v) − ∂1 (u)v, u ◦2 v = u∂2 (v) + buv

(5.21)

for u, v ∈ A.
Then (A, [·, ·]2, ◦2 ) forms a Gel’fand-Dorfman bialgebra by Theorem 3.5. On RA , the
structure map (5.10) is determined by
Y2+ (uα,i , z)uβ,j = [(α1 (β2 + b) − (α2 + b)β1 ))uα+β,i+j + (i(β2 + b) − j(α2 + b))uα+β,i+j−1
+(β2 + b)∂uα+β,i+j ]z −1 + (α2 + β2 + 2b)uα+β,i+j z −2 .

(5.22)

for α = (α1 , α2 ), β = (β1 , β2 ) ∈ Γ and i, j ∈ J. When α2 = 2b − β2 , (5.22) becomes
Y2+ (uα,i , z)uβ,j = (β2 + b)[(α1 + β1 + ∂)uα+β,i+j + (i + j)uα+β,i+j−1]z −1 .

(5.23)

Set
R2 =

F[∂]uα,i +
α=(α1 ,α2 )∈Γ, α2 =−2b

F[∂][(β1 + ∂)uβ,j + juβ,j−1].

(5.24)

β=(β1 ,−2b)∈Γ, j∈J

Then R2 forms a subalgebra of (RA , ∂, Y2+ (·, z)) by (5.23), that is,
∂R2 ⊂ R2 , Y2+ (u, z)v ∈ R2 [z −1 ]

for u, v ∈ R2 .

(5.25)

Theorem 5.3 (Xu, [X7]). The conformal algebra (R2 , ∂, Y2+ (u, z)) is a simple cubic
conformal algebra if b = 0 and is a simple quartic conformal algebra if b = 0.
