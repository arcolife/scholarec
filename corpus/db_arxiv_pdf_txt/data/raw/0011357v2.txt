Abstract
To generate small neutrino masses radiatively, the Zee-model introduces two
Higgs doublets and one weak-singlet charged Higgs boson to its Higgs sector.
From analyzing the renormalization group equations, we determine the possible range of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson (h) mass and the Higgs boson
self-couplings as a function of the cut-off scale beyond which either some of
the coupling constants are strong enough to invalidate the perturbative analysis or the stability of the electroweak vacuum is no longer guaranteed. Using
the results obtained from the above analysis, we find that the singlet charged
Higgs boson can significantly modify the partial decay width of h → γγ via
radiative corrections, and its collider phenomenology can also be drastically
different from that of the charged Higgs bosons in the usual two-Higgs-doublet
models.

I. INTRODUCTION

From the atmospheric and solar neutrino data, there is increasing evidence for neutrino
oscillations [1]. If this is a correct interpretation, the Standard Model (SM) has to be
extended to incorporate the small masses of the neutrinos suggested by data. There have
been several ideas proposed in literature to generate small neutrino masses. The Zee-model
is one of such attempts [2–6]. In this model, all flavor neutrinos are massless at the tree
level, and their small masses are induced radiatively through one-loop diagrams. For such a
mass-generation mechanism to work, it is necessary to extend the Higgs sector of the SM to
contain at least two weak-doublet fields and one weak-singlet charged scalar field. Although
some studies have been done to examine the interaction of the leptons and the Higgs bosons
in the Zee-model [7], the scalar (Higgs) sector of the model remains unexplored in detail.
In this paper we study the Higgs sector of the Zee-model to clarify its impact on the Higgs
search experiments, either at the CERN LEP-II, the Run-II of the Fermilab Tevatron, the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), or future linear colliders (LC’s).
Experimental search for the Higgs boson has been continued at the CERN LEP and the
Fermilab Tevatron experiments. In the LEP-II experiments, the Higgs boson with the mass
less than about 110 GeV has been excluded if its production cross section and decay modes
are similar to those of the SM Higgs boson [8]. Run-II of the Tevatron can be sensitive to
a SM-like Higgs boson with the mass up to about 180 GeV, provided that the integrated
luminosity of the collider is large enough (about 30 fb−1 ) [9]. Furthermore, the primary goal
of the CERN LHC experiments is to guarantee the discovery of a SM-like Higgs boson for its
mass as large as about 1 TeV [10], which is the upper bound of the SM Higgs boson mass.
(For a Higgs boson mass beyond this value, the SM is no longer a consistent low energy
theory.)
When the Higgs boson is discovered, its mass and various decay properties will be measured to test the SM and to distinguish models of new physics at high energy scales. For
example, the allowed mass range of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson (h) can be determined
3

by demanding the considered theory to be a valid effective theory all the way up to some
cut-off energy scale (Λ). For Λ = 1019 GeV (i.e., the Planck scale), the lower and upper
bounds of the SM Higgs boson masses are 137 GeV and 175 GeV, respectively [11]. The
Higgs mass bounds for the two-Higgs-doublet-model (THDM) were also investigated [12,13]
with and without including the soft-breaking term with respect to the discrete symmetry
that protects the natural flavor conservation. It was found in Ref. [13] that the lower bound
of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson is about 100 GeV in the decoupling regime where only
one neutral Higgs boson is light as compared to the other physical states of Higgs bosons.
The Higgs sector of the Zee-model is similar to that of the THDM except for the existence
of an additional weak-singlet charged Higgs field, so that the physical scalar bosons include
two CP-even, one CP-odd and two pairs of charged Higgs bosons. In this paper, we shall
first determine the upper and lower bounds for the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass (mh )
as a function of the cut-off scale Λ of the Zee-model, using renormalization group equations
(RGE’s).1 We show that the upper and lower mass bounds for h are almost the same as those
in the THDM. We also study the possible range of the Higgs-boson self-coupling constants
at the electroweak scale as a function of Λ. By using these results, we examine effects of the
additional loop contribution of the singlet charged Higgs boson to the partial decay width of
h → γγ. We show that, by taking Λ = 1019 GeV, the deviation of the decay width from the
SM prediction can be about −20% or nearly +10% for mh between 125 GeV and 140 GeV
when the mass of the isospin singlet charged Higgs boson is taken to be around 100 GeV.
The magnitude of the deviation becomes larger for lower cutoff scales and smaller masses of
the singlet charged Higgs boson. If we choose Λ = 104 GeV and the singlet charged Higgs
boson mass to be 100 GeV, the positive deviation can be greater than +30% (+40%) for
mh = 125 GeV (140 GeV). Such a deviation from the SM prediction could be tested at the

LHC, the e+ e− LC and the γγ option of LC [15–17]. We also discuss phenomenology of the
singlet charged Higgs boson at present and future collider experiments, which is found to be
completely different from that of the ordinary THDM-like charged Higgs bosons. To detect
such a charged Higgs boson at LEP-II experiments, experimentalists have to search for their
data sample with e± or µ± plus missing energy, in contrast to the usual detection channels:
either τ ν or cs decay modes.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the Higgs sector of the Zeemodel and review the neutrino masses and mixings in this model which are consistent with
the atmospheric and solar neutrino observations. Numerical results on the possible range
of the mass and coupling constants of the Higgs bosons are given in Sec. III. In Sec IV, we
discuss the one-loop effect of the extra-Higgs bosons in the Zee-model to the partial decay
width of h → γγ and its impacts on the neutral Higgs-boson search at high-energy colliders.
The phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson that comes from the additional singlet field
is discussed in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we present additional discussions and conclusion. Relevant
RGE’s for the Zee-model are given in the Appendix.

II. ZEE-MODEL

To generate small neutrino mass radiatively, the Zee-model contains a SU(2)L singlet
charged scalar field ω − , in addition to two SU(2)L doublet fields φ1 , and φ2 . The Zee-model
Lagrangian is written as:
L = Lkin + Lllω + LY ukawa − V (φ1 , φ2 , ω − ) ,

In the above equations, qL is the left-handed quark doublet with an implicit generation index

φ2 → −φ2 , ω + → +ω + , is imposed to the Higgs sector of the Lagrangian, which is only
broken softly by the m23 term and the µ term. Under the discrete symmetry there are two

in our numerical evaluation of the RGE’s2 . In that case, there is no difference between the
Yukawa couplings of the type-I and the type-II models. Finally, for simplicity, we assume
that all λi and m2i are real parameters.
Let us now discuss the Higgs sector. The SU(2)L × U(1)Y symmetry is broken to U(1)em
by φ1 and φ2 , the vacuum expectation values of φ1 and φ2 . (They are assumed to be
real so that there is no spontaneous CP violation.) The number of physical Higgs bosons
are two CP-even Higgs bosons (H,h), one CP-odd Higgs boson (A) and two pairs of charged
Higgs boson (S1± , S2± ). We take a convention of mH > mh and mS1 > mS2 . In the basis

of the physical states and the Nambu-Goldstone modes (G0 and G± ) as

greater than v 2 , µ2 and m20 ; i.e., in the decoupling regime. In this limit, the massive Higgs
bosons from the extra weak-doublet are very heavy due to the large M so that they are
decoupled from the low energy observable.
Although neutrinos in this model are massless at the tree level, the loop diagrams involving charged Higgs bosons, as shown in Fig. 1, can generate the Majorana mass terms
for all three-flavors of neutrinos. It was shown [2] that at the one-loop order, the neutrino

The phenomenological analysis of the above mass matrix was given in Ref. [4,5]. It was
concluded that, in the Zee-model, the bi-maximal mixing solution is the only possibility to
reconcile the atmospheric and the solar neutrino data. Here we give a brief summary of their
results, for completeness. Let us denote the three eigenvalues for the neutrino mass matrix,
cf. Eq. (19), as mν1 , mν2 and mν3 , which satisfy mν1 + mν2 + mν3 = 0. The possible pattern
of the neutrino mass spectrum which is allowed in the Zee-model is |mν1 | ≃ |mν2 | ≫ |mν3 |,
with mν21 −m2ν3 ≃ m2ν2 −m2ν3 = ∆m2atm , and m2ν1 − m2ν2 = ∆m2solar , where ∆m2atm = O(10−3)
eV2 from the atmospheric neutrino data, and ∆m2solar = O(10−5) eV2 (MSW large angle
solution) or O(10−10) eV2 (vacuum oscillation solution) from the solar neutrino data4 . Thus,

Therefore, the magnitudes of the three coupling constants should satisfy the relation |f12 | ≫
|f13 | ≫ |f23 |. This hierarchy among the couplings fij is crucial for our later discussion on
the phenomenology of the singlet charged Higgs bosons.
For a given value of the parameters mS1 , mS2 , tan β and µ, the coupling constants fij can
be calculated from Eq. (20). For example, for mS1 = 500 GeV, mS2 = 100 GeV, tan β = 1,
µ = 100 GeV and m12 = 3 × 10−2 eV, we obtain |f12 | ∼ 3 × 10−4 . As in this example, when

S1− is rather heavy and the lighter charged Higgs boson S2− is almost a weak singlet, i.e. the
mixing angle χ approaches to zero, it is unlikely that there are observable effects to the low
energy data [7]; e.g., the muon life-time, the universality of tau decay into electron or muon,
the rare decay of µ → eγ, the universality of W -boson decay into electron, muon or tau,
and the decay width of Z boson. When |fij | are small, we do not expect a large rate in the
lepton flavor violation decay of a light neutral Higgs boson, such as h → µ± e∓ (the largest
one), h → e± τ ∓ , or h → µ± τ ∓ (the smallest one). On the contrary, as to be discussed in
Section IV, the decay width of h → γγ can significantly deviate from the SM value.
Finally, the phenomenological constraints on f12 were derived in Ref. [6]. From the
consistency of the muon decay rate and electroweak precision test it was found that

This means that the fij cannot be O(1) unless the charged Higgs boson masses are at the
order of 10 TeV.

III. HIGGS BOSON MASS AND COUPLINGS THROUGH RGE’S

In this section, we determine the bounds on the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson
as a function of the cut-off scale of the Zee-model by analyzing the set of renormalization
group equations (RGE’s). We also study the allowed ranges of the coupling constants,
especially σ1 and σ2 in Eq. (4). In Sec. IV, they will be used to evaluate how much the
partial decay width of h → γγ can deviate from its SM value due to the one-loop contribution
from the singlet charged Higgs boson.
The mass bounds are determined in the following manner. For each set of parameters
defined at the electroweak scale, the running coupling constants are calculated numerically
11

through RGE’s at the one-loop level. We require that all the dimensionless coupling constants do not blow up below a given cut-off scale Λ, and the coupling constants satisfy the
vacuum stability condition. We vary the input parameters at the electroweak scale and
determine the possible range of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass as a function of Λ.
In a similar manner, we also study the allowed ranges of various Higgs boson self-coupling
constants at the electroweak scale as well as a function of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson
mass.
We derived the one-loop RGE’s for the Zee-model, and listed them in the Appendix for
reference. For simplicity, in the RGE’s, we have neglected all the Yukawa coupling constants
(yu , yd , ye ) but the top Yukawa coupling yt .6 Although we kept the new coupling constants
fij in the RGE’s listed in the Appendix, we have neglected fij in the numerical calculation.
This is because the magnitudes of these coupling constants are numerically too small to
affect the final results unless the singlet-charged scalar-boson mass is larger than a few TeV
[ cf. Eq. (25) ]. The dimensionless coupling constants relevant to our numerical analysis are
the three gauge-coupling constants g1 , g2 , g3 , the top Yukawa-coupling constant yt , and eight
scalar self-coupling constants, λi (i = 1 − 5) and σi (i = 1 − 3). There are five dimensionful
parameters in the Higgs potential, namely m21 , m22 , m23 , m20 and µ. Instead of m21 , m22 , m23 ,
we take v, tan β, and M 2 ≡ m23 / sin β cos β, as independent parameters, where v (∼ 246
GeV) characterizes the weak scale and M the soft-breaking scale of the discrete symmetry.
In the actual numerical calculation we first fix tan β and M. For a given mass (mh ) of
the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, we solve one of the λi , which is chosen to be λ3 here,
in terms of other λi . We then numerically evaluate all dimensionless coupling constants
according to the RGE’s. From mh to M we use the SM RGE’s, which are matched to the

the model with the type-II Yukawa interaction, the bottom-quark Yukawa interaction can

become important for a large tan β.

12

Zee-model RGE’s at the soft-breaking scale M.

7

We requires the following two conditions to be satisfied for each scale Q up to a given
cut-off scale Λ.
1. Applicability of the perturbation theory implies
λi (Q) < 8π,

σi (Q) < 8π,

yt2 (Q) < 4π .

(27)

2. The vacuum stability conditions must be satisfied. The requirement that quartic
coupling terms of the scalar potential do not have a negative coefficient in any direction
leads to the following conditions at each renormalization scale Q:
(a)
λ1 (Q) > 0,

λ2 (Q) > 0,

σ3 (Q) > 0 .

(28)

(b)
σ1 (Q) +

λ1 (Q) σ3 (Q)

(29)

σ2 (Q) +

λ2 (Q) σ3 (Q)
> 0,

(30)

λ(Q) +

λ1 (Q) λ2 (Q) > 0 ,

(31)

where λ(Q) = λ3 (Q) + min (0, λ4 (Q) + λ5 (Q), λ4 (Q) − λ5 (Q)).
7 The

parameter m0 and µ are only relevant to the charged scalar mass matrix. In principle, our

numerical results also depend on these parameters through the renormalization of various coupling
constants from the scale of mh to the charged scalar mass. Since these effects are expected to be
small, we calculate the RGE’s as if all the scalar-bosons except h decouple at the scale M .

In addition to the above conditions, we also demand local stability of the potential at the
electroweak scale, namely, we calculate the mass spectrum of all scalar fields at the extremum
of the potential and demand that all eigenvalues of the squared scalar mass are positive. We
scan the remaining seven-dimensional space of λi and σi and examine whether a given mass
of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson is allowed under the above conditions. In this way we
obtain the allowed range of mh as a function of tan β and M, for each value of the cut-off
scale Λ.
First, we discuss our result in the decoupling case, in which the soft-breaking scale M
is much larger than the electroweak scale ∼ v, and the masses of all the Higgs bosons but
h (and S2 ) are at the order of M 8 . In Fig. 2, the allowed range of mh is shown as a
function of tan β for M = 1000 GeV. (We take the pole mass of top quark mt = 175 GeV,

8 In

the decoupling regime (M → ∞, which leads to α → β −

and χ → 0), the masses of h and

S2 are dominated by the (11) component of the mass matrix in Eq. (7) and the (22) component of
that in Eq. (9), respectively. The mass of h is determined by the self-coupling constants λi , while
that of S2 depends not only on the self-couplings constants σi but also on the free mass parameter
m0 . As noticed in the footnote 7, from mh to M , the SM RGE are used in our analysis, even if

αs (mZ ) = 0.118 for numerical calculation.) The allowed ranges are shown as contours for
six different values of Λ, i.e. Λ = 1019 , 1016 ,1013 ,1010 ,107 and 104 GeV. For most values
of tan β, except for small tan β region, the upper bound of mh is about 175 GeV and the
lower bound is between 110 GeV and 120 GeV for the cut-off scale Λ to be near the Planck
scale. The numerical values in this figure are very close to those in the corresponding figure
for the THDM discussed in Ref. [13]. Compared to the corresponding lower mass bound in
the SM, which is 145 GeV when using the one-loop RGE’s, the lower mass bound in this
model is reduced by about 30 GeV to 40 GeV. The reason is similar to the THDM case: the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass is essentially determined by the value of λ2 for tan β to

the mass of S2 is smaller than M . The effect of S2 on the mass bound of h is expected to be small,
because at the one-loop level the primary effect is through the running of g1 , whose contribution
to the right-handed side of the RGE for the Higgs-self coupling constant is small.

be larger than about 2 , where λ2 plays the role of the self-coupling constant of the Higgs
potential in the SM9 . On the right-hand side of the RGE for λ2 , cf. Eq. (A5), there are
additional positive-definite terms

(λ23 + (λ3 + λ4 )2 + λ25 + σ22 ) as compared to the RGE

for the Higgs self-coupling constant in the SM. These additional terms can improve vacuum
stability, and allow lower values of mh . Therefore, one of the features of the model is to have
a different mass range for the lightest CP-even Higgs boson as compared to the SM Higgs
boson, for a given cut-off scale.
Next, we show our result for M to be around v. In Fig. 3, we present the mh bound for
M = 100 GeV. In this case, the allowed range of mh is reduced as compared to that in the
decoupling case, and lies around mh ∼ M for large tan β. Notice that we have not included

tan β cannot be too large to ignore the contribution of the bottom quark in the case

phenomenological constraints from the b → sγ, ρ parameter and the direct Higgs boson
search experiment at LEP. As mentioned before, the mass bounds obtained from the RGE
analysis are the same for the type-I and type-II models without these phenomenological
constraints. However, it was shown in Ref. [13] that the b → sγ data can put a strong
< 200–400 GeV in the
constraint on the allowed range of the Higgs boson mass for M ∼
type-II THDM, whereas there is no appreciable effect in the type-I model. This is because a
small M implies a light charged Higgs boson in the THDM which can induce a large decay
branching ratio for b → sγ in the type-II model [19]10 . We expect a similar constraint from
the b → sγ data on the type-II Zee-model, when M is small.
In Fig. 4, we show the upper and lower bounds of mh as a function of M for various
√
values of Λ. For given M, we scan the range of tan β for 1 ≤ tan β ≤ 16 2 (≃ 22.6). We
find that the obtained mh bounds are almost the same as those for the THDM. The primary
reason for this is that the new coupling constants σ1 , σ2 and σ3 do not appear directly in
the mass formula for mh , and therefore, do not induce large effects on the bounds of mh .
We also investigate the allowed range of coupling constants σ1 , σ2 and σ3 . For this
purpose, we fix σ1 (or σ2 , σ3 ) as well as tan β and M to evaluate the upper and the lower
bounds of mh for each Λ value. In this way, we determine the possible range of σ1 (or σ2 ,
σ3 ) under the condition that the theory does not break down below the cut-off scale Λ. In
Fig. 5, we present the allowed range of σ1 and mh for different choice of Λ in the case of
√
√
M = 1000 GeV and tan β = 2 or 16 2. A similar figure is shown for the possible range of
σ2 in Fig. 6. We see that the maximal value of σ1 and σ2 is around 0.7 for mh = 110 − 170
GeV if we take the cut-off scale to be 1019 GeV. For smaller value of Λ the allowed ranges
of σi becomes larger. For example, σ1 can exceed 1 for Λ = 1013 GeV. We have calculated
for other value of tan β and checked that these figures does not change greatly between

addition, it has been known that the Rb data also give strong constraints on the charged

Higgs bosons in the type-II THDM [20].

new coupling constants on the collider phenomenology is discussed in the next section.

IV. TWO-PHOTON DECAY WIDTH OF THE NEUTRAL HIGGS BOSON

In this section, we study the phenomenological consequences of the Higgs boson mass and
the Higgs-boson-coupling constants derived in the previous section. The important feature
of the Higgs sector of the Zee-model is that there are an additional weak doublet and a
singlet charged Higgs boson. The physical states of the Higgs particles are two CP-even
Higgs bosons, one CP-odd Higgs boson and two pairs of charged Higgs bosons. Therefore,
the Higgs phenomenology is quite close to the ordinary two-Higgs-doublet model. One
unique difference is the existence of the additional weak-singlet charged Higgs boson. The
effect of this extra charged Higgs boson is especially important when M is much larger
than the Z boson mass, i.e. in the decoupling regime. In such a case, the heavier CP-even
Higgs boson, the CP-odd Higgs boson as well as one of the charged Higgs bosons have
masses approximately equal to M, and these heavy states are decoupled from low energy
observables. (Note that the condition on the applicability of the perturbation theory forbids
too large self-couplings among the Higgs bosons. Hence, in the limit of large M, the heavy
Higgs bosons decouple from the low energy effective theory. ) The remaining light states
are the lighter CP-even Higgs boson h and the lighter charged Higgs boson S2 which mainly
comes from the weak-singlet. In the previous section, we show that, even in the decoupling
case, there can be large difference in the allowed range of mh between the Zee-model and the
SM. Similarly, we expect that, even in the decoupling case, the presence of the additional
weak-singlet charged Higgs boson can give rise to interesting Higgs phenomenology.
Since the lighter charged Higgs boson S2 can couple to Higgs bosons and leptons, it can
affect the decay and the production of the neutral Higgs bosons at colliders through radiative
corrections. In the following, we consider the decay width of h → γγ as an example. For
a SM Higgs boson, the partial decay width (or branching ratio) of h → γγ is small: ∼ 9.2
keV (or 2.2 × 10−3 ) for mh = 125 GeV, and ∼ 15.4 keV (or 1.9 × 10−3 ) for mh = 140 GeV,
with a 175 GeV top quark. Nevertheless, it is an important discovery mode of the Higgs
boson at the LHC experiments for mh less than twice of the W -boson mass. Needless to
24

say that a change in the branching ratio of h → γγ would lead to a different production
rate of pp → hX → γγX. At future e+ e− LC’s, the branching ratio of h → γγ can be
determined via the reaction e+ e− → qqγγ and e+ e− → ννγγ with a 16-22% accuracy [16].
At the photon-photon collision option of the future LC’s, the partial decay width of h → γγ
can be precisely tested within a 2 % accuracy [17] by measuring the inclusive production
rate of the Higgs boson h. Clearly, a change in the partial decay width of h → γγ will
lead to a different production rate for h. In the Zee-model, such a change is expected after
taking into account the loop contribution of the extra charged Higgs boson. We find that
the deviation from the SM prediction can be sizable, and therefore testable at the LHC and
future LC’s.
The partial decay width of h → γγ is calculated at the one-loop order. Similar to our
√
previous discussion, we limit ourselves to the parameter space in which 1 ≤ tan β ≤ 16 2,
and keep only the top quark contribution from the fermionic loop diagrams. Including the
loop contributions from the W boson and the charged Higgs bosons S1 and S2 together with
the top quark loop contribution, we obtain [21]

In the decoupling case of the model, namely M 2 ≫ λi v 2 , the above formulae are greatly
simplified. This limit corresponds to α → β − π2 and χ → 0, so that the light charged Higgs
boson S2± is identical to the weak-singlet Higgs boson ω ± . Thus, we have

and both the top-quark and the W boson loop contributions reduce to their SM values. We
like to stress that the weak-singlet Higgs boson does not directly couple to the quark fields
in the limit of χ → 0. Therefore, it does not affect the decay rate of b → sγ at the one-loop
order. Similarly, being a weak singlet, it also gives no contribution to the ρ parameter.
Hence the low-energy constraint from either the b → sγ decay or the ρ parameter on the
Zee-model in the limit of χ → 0 is similar to effects of that on the THDM. Let us examine
at the one-loop effect of the weak-singlet charged Higgs boson on the decay width of h → γγ
in the decoupling limit. Let us recall that in Fig. 8, the size of the new couplings σ1 and

σ2 can be as large as 2 simultaneously, if the cut-off scale is at the order of 107 GeV. For
the Zee-model to be a valid low energy effective theory up to 1019 GeV, σ1 and σ2 cannot
be much larger than 0.6. To illustrate the implications of this result, we show in Figs. 10
(a) and 10 (b) the ratio (r) of the h → γγ width predicted in the Zee-model to that in the
SM, r ≡ ΓZee (h → γγ)/ΓSM (h → γγ), as a function of the coupling constant σ2 and the
charged Higgs boson mass mS2 . Here, for simplicity, we have set σ1 = σ2 so that the tan β
dependence drops in the decoupling case, cf. Eq. (42). For illustrations, we consider two
cases for the mass of the lighter CP-even Higgs boson: mh = 125 GeV and mh = 140 GeV.
As shown in the figures, the ratio r can be around 0.8 for σ1 = σ2 ≡ σ ≈ 0.5 and mS2 ≈ 100
GeV. This reduction is due to the cancellation between the contribution from the S2 -boson

for a heavier S2 , the coupling constant σ2 (and σ1 ) has to be larger. Next, as shown in
Figs. 7 and 8, σ1 and σ2 do not have to take the same values in general, and they can be less
than zero. In the case where both σ1 and σ2 are negative, the contribution of the S2 -loop

SM prediction can be about +6% (+30%) for mS2 = 100 GeV. In Fig. 11 (b), the similar

plot of the ratio r is shown for mh = 140 GeV with σ1 = 0 and tan β = 16 2. Each case
with σ2 = −0.25, −0.6 or −1 is consistent with Λ = 1019 , 107 or 104 GeV, respectively. The
correction is larger in the case with mh = 140 GeV than in the case with mh = 125 GeV
for a given Λ. The deviation from the SM prediction can amount to about +8% (+40%) for
Λ = 1019 GeV (104 GeV) when mS2 = 100 GeV. Larger positive corrections are obtained
for smaller mS2 values. Such a deviation from the SM prediction can be tested at the LHC,
the e+ e− LC and the γγ option of LC.

Before concluding this section, we remark that if mh is larger than 2mS2 such that the
decay mode h → S2+ S2− is open, the total decay width of h can be largely modified from the
SM prediction for large σ1,2 . In terms of RS2 , the partial decay width of h → S2+ S2− is given
by

where c2 = (2m2S2 RS2 /v 2 )2 . In Fig. 12 (a), we show the partial decay width Γ(h → S2+ S2− )
for mS2 = 80, 100, 150, 200 GeV with σ1 = σ2 = 1, cf. Eq. (42), for the allowed range of mh
from 100 GeV to 500 GeV. In Fig. 12 (b), the ratio of Γ(h → S2+ S2− ) to the total width of the

SM Higgs boson (Γtotal

illustrate the possible size of the difference between the total width of the lightest CP-even
Higgs boson h in the Zee-model and that of the SM Higgs boson11 . Clearly, the impact of
the S2+ S2− decay channel is especially large in the small mh region. We note that Γtotal
(SM)
h
can be determined to the accuracy of 10-20% at the LHC and the LC if mh < 2mZ , and to
that of a couple of per cents if mh > 2mZ [23]. (mZ is the mass of the Z-boson.) Hence,
measuring the total width of the lightest neutral Higgs boson can provide a further test
of the Zee-model for mh > 2mS2 . The change in the total width also modifies the decay
branching ratio of h → ZZ, hence yields a different rate of h → ZZ → µ+ µ− µ+ µ− for a
given mh . (In the SM, the branching ratio of h → ZZ is about 1/3 for mh > 200 GeV.)
Needless to say that for mh > 2mS2 , the production mode of h → S2+ S2− → ℓ+ ℓ′ − E/T is also
useful to test the Zee-model. Further discussion on this possibility will be given in Sec. VI.

11 In

doing this analysis, we have in mind a low cut-off scale Λ = 104 GeV, which allows a wide

range of values for σ’s, mS2 and mh .

V. PHENOMENOLOGY OF CHARGED-HIGGS BOSONS

In the Zee-model, two kinds of charged Higgs bosons appear. If there is no mixing
between them (χ = 0), the mass eigenstates S1± and S2± correspond to the THDM-like
charged Higgs field and the singlet Higgs field ω ± , respectively. The case with χ = 0 occurs
in the limit of M 2 ≫ v 2 , µ2 and m20 ; i.e. in the decoupling limit. The detection of S2± can
be a clear indication of the Zee-model. As to be shown later, its phenomenology is found to
be drastically different from that of the THDM-like charged Higgs bosons S1± [24]. Here, we
discuss how the effects of this extra charged boson can be explored experimentally. We first
consider the case with χ = 0, and then extend the discussion to the case with a non-zero χ.
The S2− boson decays into a lepton pair ei− ν cej with the coupling constant fij . The partial

decay rate, ΓSij2 = Γ(S2− → e−

By taking into account the hierarchy pattern of fij , cf. Eqs. (23) and (24), and by assuming
mS2 = 100 GeV and |f12 | = 3 × 10−4 , the total decay width and the life time (τ ) is estimated
to be12

This implies that S2 decays after traveling a distance of ∼ 10−10 m, which is significantly
12 The

size of the decay width depends on the value of f12 . If we take mS1 > 500 GeV or µ < 100

GeV, f12 can become one order of magnitude larger than 3 × 10−4 , while still being consistent with
the phenomenological bounds discussed in Sec. II.

31

shorter than the typical detector scale. Therefore, S2± decays promptly after its production,
and can be detected at collider experiments.
The main production channel at the LEP-II experiment may be the pair production
process e+ e− → S2+ S2− , similar to the production of the THDM-like charged Higgs boson
S1+ . The matrix-element squares for the Si+ Si− production (i = 1, 2) are given by

(49)

Hence, the production rates of S1− and S2− are different. We note that the ratio of cross
sections for S1+ S1− and S2+ S2− production, σ(e+ e− → S2+ S2− )/σ(e+ e− → S1+ S1− ), is 0.8 at
√
s = 210 GeV assuming that the masses of S1± and S2± are the same. This ratio is independent of the masses of S1 and S2 for a fixed CM energy. (Only the difference between
S1+ S1− Z and S2+ S2− Z coupling constants determines this ratio. )
The lower mass bound of the THDM-like charged boson S1± can be obtained by studying
its τ ν and cs decay modes, completely in the same way as the charged Higgs boson search in
the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [22]. Similar experimental constraints
may be obtained for the extra charged bosons S2± . The situation, however, turns out to be
fairly different from the S1± case. First of all, decays of S2± are all leptonic. Secondly, the
branching ratios of various S2± decay modes are estimated as
B(S2− → e− E/T ) ∼ 0.5,
B(S2− → µ− E/T ) ∼ 0.5,
B(S2− → τ − E/T ) ∼ O

where we have used the relations given in Eqs. (23) and (24). Clearly, the branching ratio
into the τ − E/T mode is very small, so that it is not useful for detecting S2± at all. This is
different from the case of detecting the ordinary THDM-like charged Higgs boson, which
preferentially decays into heavy fermion pairs (e.g. τ ν and cs). Instead of studying the
τ ± ν c mode, the e± ν c and µ± ν c modes can provide a strong constraint on the mass of
S2± . In fact, the branching ratio of S2− → e− E/T or µ− E/T is almost 100 %, so that we have
σ(e+ e− → S2+ S2− → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T ) ∼ σ(e+ e− → S2+ S2− ), where ℓ− and ℓ′− represent e− or µ− (not
τ − ). Let us compare this with the cross section σ(e+ e− → W + W − → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T ) = σ(e+ e− →
W + W − )·B(W − → ℓ− E/T )2 , where B(W − → ℓ− E/T ) = B(W − → e− E/T )+B(W − → µ− E/T ) ∼
21%. As seen in Fig. 13, the cross section σ(e+ e− → S2+ S2− → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T ) is comparable with
σ(e+ e− → W + W − → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T ). Therefore, by examining the LEP-II data for ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T
(where ℓ+ ℓ′− = e+ e− , e± µ∓ or µ+ µ− , in contrast to τ + τ − for the S1± case), the experimental
lower bound on the mass of S2± can be determined. Such a bound can be induced from
the smuon search results at the LEP experiments [25,26] in the case that neutralinos are
√
assumed to be massless. From the µ+ µ− E/T data accumulated up to s = 202 GeV [26],
we find that the lower mass bound of S2± is likely to be 80-85 GeV for the χ = 0 cases. [
We note that the right-handed smuon (˜
µ±
R ) in the MSSM carries the same SU(2) × U(1)
quantum number as the weak-singlet charged Higgs boson (S2± for χ± ∼ 0). ]
We next comment on S2± -production processes at hadron colliders and future LC’s. At
hadron colliders, the dominant production mode is the pair production through the Drell√
Yan-type process. The cross sections for pp → S2+ S2− at the Tevatron Run-II energy ( s = 2
√
TeV) and pp → S2+ S2− at the LHC energy ( s = 14 TeV) are shown as a function of mS2
in Fig. 14 for χ = 0. At future LC’s, the S2± boson may be discovered through the above√
discussed pair-production process from the electron-positron annihilation if s/2 > mS2 . In
Fig. 15, we show the total cross section of e+ e− → S2+ S2− for χ = 0 as a function of mS2 for
√
s = 300, 500, and 1000 GeV.
Finally, we like to discuss the case with a non-zero χ, in which S2− is a mixture of the
singlet charged Higgs boson state (ω − ) and the doublet charged Higgs boson state (H − ). Let

with the mass of 100 GeV mainly decay into the τ − ν and cs channels. Thus, the branching

In the THDM, the total decay width of the charged Higgs boson (H − ) for mH − = 100 GeV
is about 470 keV. Hence, if the mixing angle χ is not so small, the decay pattern of S2− is
dominated by that of the THDM charged Higgs boson H − . In Fig. 16, we plot the branching
ratio B(S2− → ℓ− E/T ) as a function of sin χ at mS2 = 100 GeV for several values of f12 . We
only show the case with tan β = 1, where the result is independent of the type of the Yukawa
interaction. The coupling constant f12 is taken to be 3, 9, 18 and 36 (×10−4 ), which satisfy
the phenomenological constraints given in Sec. II. As expected, the branching ratio decreases
as χ increases. When f12 = 36 × 10−4 , B(S2− → ℓ− E/T ) is smaller than 10% for sin χ > 0.89.
36

For the smaller f12 values, the branching ratio reduces more quickly. The branching ratio is
not sensitive to mS2 unless the mass exceeds the threshold of the decay into a tb or h0 W −
pair. Above the threshold of the tb pair production, the decay rate of S2− → tb is large due
to the large mass of the top quarks, so that B(S2− → ℓ− E/T ) is substantial only for very
small values of χ. Finally, while the decay branching ratio can change drastically depending
on the mixing angle χ, the production cross section for e+ e− → S2+ S2− remains unchanged.
In conclusion, the process e+ e− → S2+ S2− → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T can also be useful for testing the
Zee-model in the non-zero χ case, provided sin χ is not too large.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, the Higgs sector of the Zee-model has been investigated, in which neutrino
masses are generated radiatively. This model contains extra weak-doublet Higgs field and
singlet charged Higgs field.
We have studied indirect effects of these extra Higgs bosons on the theoretical mass
bounds of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, which are obtained from the requirement that
the running coupling constants neither blow up to a very large value nor fall down to a
negative value, up to a high-energy cut-off scale Λ. For Λ = 1019 GeV, the upper bound
of mh is found to be about 175 GeV, which is almost the same value as the SM prediction.
In the decoupling regime (M ≫ mZ ), the lower bound is found to be about 100 GeV for
Λ = 1019 GeV, which is much smaller than the lower bound in the SM, and is almost the
same as that in the THDM. For smaller Λ values, the bounds are more relaxed, similar
to that of the SM. We have also investigated the allowed range of the coupling constants
relevant to the weak-singlet Higgs field.
The most striking feature of the Zee-model Higgs sector is the existence of the weaksinglet charged Higgs boson. We have examined the possible impact of the singlet chargedHiggs boson on the neutral Higgs boson search through radiative corrections. We found
that its one-loop contributions to the h → γγ width can be sizable. In the allowed range
37

of the coupling constants the deviation from the SM prediction for this decay width can be
about −20% or near +10% for mS2 = 100 GeV and Λ = 1019 GeV, depending on the sign
of the coupling constants σi . The magnitude of the deviation is larger for lower Λ values
or for smaller mS2 values. For example, a positive deviation over 30-40% is possible for
mh = 125-140 GeV, mS2 = 100 GeV, and Λ = 104 GeV.
In the decoupling limit (i.e. when M 2 ≫ v 2 , where α → β − π/2 and χ → 0), we
expect that the production cross sections for gg → h, e+ e− → ννh and e+ e− → Z 0 h in
the Zee-model are the same as those in the SM. However, a sizable change in the decay
branching ratio of h → γγ can alter the production rate of pp → hX → γγX at the
LHC, where this production rate can be determined with a relative error of 10-15% [15].
Also, such a deviation in the branching ratio of h → γγ directly affects the cross section
of e+ e− → ννh (andZ 0 h) → ννγγ, which can be measured with an accuracy of 16-22%
√
at the future e+ e− LC (with s = 500 GeV and the integrated luminosity of 1 ab−1 ) [16].
Therefore, the Zee-model with low cut-off scales can be tested through the h → γγ process at
the LHC and the e+ e− LC’s. At the future photon colliders, the enhancement (or reduction)
of the h → γγ partial decay rate will manifest itself in the different production rate of h
from the SM prediction. A few per cent of the deviation in Γ(h → γγ) · B(h → bb) can be
detected at a photon collider [17], so that the effects of the singlet charged Higgs boson can
be tested even if the cutoff scale Λ is at the Planck scale.
The collider phenomenology of the singlet charged Higgs boson has turned out to be
completely different from that of the THDM-like charged Higgs boson. The singlet charged
Higgs boson mainly decays into ℓ± E/T (with ℓ± = e± or µ± ), while the decay mode τ ± E/T
is almost negligible due to the relation |f12 | ≫ |f13 | ≫ |f23 |. This hierarchy among the
coupling constants fij results from demanding bi-maximal mixings in the neutrino mass
matrix generated in the Zee-model to be consistent with the neutrino oscillation data. On
the other hand, the THDM-like charged Higgs boson decays mainly into either the τ ν mode
or the cs mode, through the usual Yukawa-interactions. Hence, to probe this singlet charged
Higgs boson using the LEP-II data, experimentalists should examine their data sample with
38

e+ e− E/T , e+ µ− E/T , µ+ e− E/T or µ+ µ− E/T , while the experimental lower mass bound of the
THDM-like charged Higgs boson is obtained from examining the τ τ E/T , τ E/T jj and jjjj
events. Using the published LEP-II constraints on the MSSM smuon production (assuming
the lightest neutralinos to be massless), we estimate the current lower mass bound of this
singlet charged Higgs boson to be about 80-85 GeV. The Tevatron Run-II, LHC and future
LC’s can further test this model.
Finally, we comment on a case in which the singlet charged Higgs boson (S2± for χ = 0)
is the lightest of all the Higgs bosons. For mh /2 > mS2 > mZ , the Higgs sector of the
Zee-model can be further tested by measuring the production rate of pp (or pp) → hX →
S2+ S2− X → ℓ+ ℓ′− E/T X. The branching ratio for h → S2+ S2− → ℓ+ ℓ′ − E/T can be large. For
instance, for mh = 210 GeV and mS2 = 100 GeV, this branching ratio is about 12% for
each ℓ+ ℓ′ − = e+ e− , e+ µ− , µ+ e− or µ+ µ− . The branching ratio decreases for larger masses
of h. Moreover, the total decay width of h can be largely modified when the decay channel
h → S2+ S2− is open. In this case, the decay branching ratios of h → W + W − , ZZ are also
different from the SM predictions.
In conclusion, the distinguishable features of the Zee-model from the SM and the THDM
can be tested by the data from LEP-II, the Tevatron Run-II and future experiments at LHC
and LC’s.
