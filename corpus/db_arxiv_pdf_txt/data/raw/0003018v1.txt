Abstract : A very elementary introduction to quantum algebras is presented and a
few examples of their physical applications are mentioned.
I shall give a very elementary introduction to the topic of quantum algebras and
mention a few physical applications. Quantum algebras, or quantum groups, extend the domain of classical group theory and constitute a new and growing field
of mathematics with vast potential for applications in physics. In fact, the origins
of quantum groups lie in physics : in the studies on the behaviour of integrable systems in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, using the quantum inverse
scattering method, by Sklyanin, Kulish, Reshetikhin, Takhtajan, and Faddeev in
the 1980s. Mathematical abstraction from the observations on the common features of these systems led to the definition of the concept of a quantum group and
the studies of Drinfeld, Jimbo, Manin, Woronowicz, Connes, Wess, Zumino, Macfarlane, Biedenharn, ..., revealed many aspects of quantum groups from different
mathematical and physical points of view. I shall neither go into the history of the
developements of the various significant concepts nor give any specific references to
their origins. I shall cite at the end some books and articles which would give these
details and lead to the vast literature on the subject of quantum groups and their
applications.
Let us consider a two dimensional classical vector space whose elements can be
written as
x
,
(1)
y
where the coordinates x and y are real variables and commute with each other, i.e.,
xy = yx .

(2)

In the space of functions {f (x, y)} defined in the above vector space the partial
∂

derivative operations ∂x
and ∂y
and the operations of multiplications by x and y
satisfy the differential calculus

or in other words the transformation (5) is an element of the group SL(2, R). Then,
the new coordinates x′ and y ′ and partial derivatives with respect to them, namely
∂
and ∂y∂ ′ , also satisfy the same relations as (3). This is easily checked by noting

where A means the transpose of the matrix A. We say that the differential calculus
on the two dimensional (x, y)-plane is covariant under the group SL(2, R).
In nature all physical systems are quantum mechanical. But, the quantum mechanical behaviour is generally revealed only at the microscopic (molecular and
deeper) level. At the macroscopic level of everyday experience quantum physics
becomes classical physics as an approximation. So, only classical physics was discovered first and observations of failure of classical physics at the atomic level led to
the discovery of quantum physics in the 20th century. This passage from classical
physics to quantum physics can be mathematically described as a process of deformation of the classical physics wherein the commuting classical observables of a
physical system are replaced by noncommuting hermitian operators. This process is
characterized by a very small deformation parameter known as the Planck constant
h
¯ and, roughly speaking, in the limit h
¯ −→ 0 classical physics is recovered from the
structure of quantum physics.
In analogy with the process of quantizing the classical physics let us now quantize the classical vector space to get a quantum vector space by assuming that the
coordinates do not commute with each other at any point. Let us model the noncommutativity of the coordinates X and Y of a two dimensional quantum plane
by
XY = qY X ,
(8)
where q is the deformation parameter which we shall consider, in general, to be
any nonzero complex number. Note that in the limit q −→ 1 the noncommuting
quantum coordinates X and Y become commuting classical coordinates. To be
specific, let us choose
q = eiθ .
(9)
2

It is easy to find an example of such noncommuting variables. Let Tα and Gθ/α be
operators acting on functions of a single real variable x such that
Tα ψ(x) = ψ(x + α) ,

Gθ/α ψ(x) = eiθx/α ψ(x) .

(10)

Then, for any ψ(x),
Tα Gθ/α ψ(x) = eiθ(x+α)/α ψ(x + α) = eiθ Gθ/α Tα ψ(x) ,

(11)

for a given fixed value of θ. Thus, with the variation of α, Tα and Gθ/α become
noncommuting variables obeying the relation
Tα Gθ/α = eiθ Gθ/α Tα ,

(12)

with fixed value for θ.
Now the interesting questions are :
• Is it possible to define a differential calculus on the two dimensional (X, Y )plane?
• If so, will it be covariant under some generalization of the classical group
SL(2)?
The answers are yes, yes! First let us understand how one can give a meaning
to partial derivatives with respect to X and Y . These have to operate on the
space of functions {f (X, Y )} which we shall consider to be polynomials in X and
Y . We can write f (X, Y ) = m,n fmn X m Y n since any polynomial in X and Y ,
with coefficients commuting with X and Y , can be brought to this form using the
commutation relation (8). Then, if we take formally
∂ m
X = mX m−1 ,
∂X

∂ n
Y = nY n−1 ,
∂Y

(13)

we would have a differential calculus in the (X, Y )-plane, as desired, once we pre∂
scribe consistently the remaining commutation relations between X, Y , ∂X
and
∂
.
∂Y
Without going into any further details, let me state the complete set of commutation relations defining the differential calculus in the (X, Y )-plane (with q = eiθ ) :

may be ordinary classical matrices satisfying the required relations (17). Define the

Note that there is no inverse for this coproduct. Under this coproduct the 2 × 2

form a pseudomatrix group, commonly called
C D
a quantum group, denoted by SLq (2). The algebra of functions over SLq (2), or the
algebra of polynomials in {A, B, C, D}, is denoted by F unq (SL(2)). The coproduct
operation (∆) defined by (22), is symbolically written as
∆(A) = A ⊗ A + B ⊗ C ,
∆(C) = C ⊗ A + D ⊗ C ,

∆(B) = A ⊗ B + B ⊗ D ,
∆(D) = C ⊗ B + D ⊗ D .

(23)

For any f (A, B, C, D) ∈ F unq (SL(2)) the definition of ∆ is extended as
∆f (A, B, C, D) = f (∆(A), ∆(B), ∆(C), ∆(D)). The algebra F unq (SL(2)) is technically a Hopf algebra. To complete this algebraic structure two more operations
called the coinverse (or antipode) denoted by S, and the counit denoted by ε, are
defined and these operations ∆, S, and ε are required to satisfy certain axioms. We
shall not consider these details of the Hopf algebraic structure. From the point of
view physical applications quantum groups provide a generalization of symmetry
concepts and involve mainly two fundamental new ideas : deformation and noncommutative comultiplication.

In the theory of classical Lie groups we know that an element of a Lie group G,
say g, can be written as
g = eǫ1 L1 eǫ2 L2 · · · eǫn Ln ,
(29)
where the parameters {ǫi } characterize the group element g and {Li } are constant

Now, the interesting question is
• Is there an analogue of the Lie algebra in the case of a quantum group?
The answer is yes! To this end, first we have to recall some basic notions of the
theory of q-series.
One defines the q-shifted factorial by
(x; q)n =

1,
n = 0,
2
n−1
(1 − x)(1 − xq)(1 − xq ) . . . (1 − xq ) , n = 1, 2, . . . .

(32)

Then, with the notation
(x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ; q)n = (x1 ; q)n (x2 ; q)n . . . (xm ; q)n ,

(33)

an r φs basic hypergeometric series, or a general q-hypergeometric series, is given by
r φs

r, s = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Consider

(35)

where
1 − qn

1−q
[n]q ! = [n]q [n − 1]q [n − 2]q . . . [2]q [1]q ,

[n]q =

n = 1, 2, . . . , [0]q ! = 1 .

(36)

The q-number [n]q , or the so-called basic number, was defined by Heine (1846).
Much of Ramanujan’s work is related to these q-series. Note that
q→1

q→1

eqz −→ ez .

[n]q −→ n ,

(37)

Thus, ezq defined by (35) is a q-generalization of the exponential function, called a
q-exponential function ; note that there can be several generalizations of the exponential function satisfying the condition that in the limit q → 1 it should become the
standard exponential function. In the theory of quantum groups a new definition of
the q-number is often useful. It is
[[n]]q =

q n − q −n
.
q − q −1

(38)

Note that [[n]]q also becomes n in the limit q → 1, and [[n]]q is symmetric with respect
to the interchange of q and q −1 unlike Heine’s [n]q .
Now consider the 2-dimensional T -matrix parametrized as
T =

A B
C D

eα
eα β
γeα e−α + γeα β

(39)

which requires the variable parameters {α, β, γ} to satisfy a Lie algebra
[α, β] = (log q) β ,

[α, γ] = (log q) γ ,

[β, γ] = 0 ,

(40)

so that {A, B, C, D} obey the algebra (17). Then, one can write
γX

Actually, equation (41) is the special case of a universal formula for the representations of the T -matrices of SLq (2) and corresponds to the fundamental representation. The generic form of the T -matrix is given by

they also provide the fundamental representation of the generators of sl(2) algebra (45)). When a higher dimensional representation of (44) is plugged in the formula (43) T becomes a higher dimensional representation of the T -matrix. For example, the three dimensional representation (26) is obtained by substituting in (43)

which provide the three dimensional irreducible representation of the slq (2) algebra (44), and using the parametrization of {A, B, C, D} in terms of {α, β, γ} as
given by (39). Note that in the limit q → 1 these matrices (46) obey the sl(2)
algebra (45). As seen from (39), (43) and (44), one can say that for a quantum
group the group-parameter space is noncommutative.
The algebra slq (2) is also often called a quantum group. Actually, the relations
in (44) define the generators of the q-deformation of the universal enveloping algebra
of sl(2). Hence, the relations (44) are also referred to, more properly, as Uq (sl(2)),
the q-deformed universal enveloping algebra of sl(2). The algebra Uq (sl(2)), generated by polynomials in {X0 , X+ , X− } obeying the relations (44), is also a Hopf
algebra. We shall consider only the coproduct(s) for Uq (sl(2)). A coproduct for
slq (2) is
∆q (X0 ) = X0 ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ X0 ,

∆q (X± ) = X± ⊗ q X0 + q −X0 ⊗ X± .

(47)

It can be easily verified that this comultiplication rule is an algebra isomorphism for
slq (2) :
[∆q (X0 ) , ∆q (X± )] = ±∆q (X± ) ,

[∆q (X+ ) , ∆q (X− )] = [[2∆q (X0 )]]q .

(48)

The most important property of this coproduct is its noncommutativity. Note that
the algebra (44) is invariant under the interchange q ↔ q −1 since [[2X0 ]]q = [[2X0 ]]q−1 .
8

However, the comultiplication (47) is not invariant under such an interchange. This
means that the comultiplication obtained from (47) by an interchange q ↔ q −1
should also be an equally good comultiplication. It can be verified that the coproduct
so obtained, namely,
∆q−1 (X± ) = X± ⊗ q −X0 + q X0 ⊗ X± .

∆q−1 (X0 ) = X0 ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ X0 ,

(49)

is indeed an algebra isomorphism for slq (2). This coproduct (49), ∆q−1 , is called the
opposite coproduct in view of the relation
∆q−1 (X ) = τ (∆q (X )) , where τ (u ⊗ v) = v ⊗ u .

(50)

Since
∆q−1 = ∆q ,

or τ (∆) = ∆ ,

(51)

the comultiplications ∆q and ∆q−1 of slq (2) are noncommutative. In the limit q → 1,
the classical sl(2) has only a single comultiplication, ∆(X) = X ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ X , which
is commutative (i.e., τ (∆) = ∆).
One can show that the two comultiplications of sl2 (q), namely ∆q and ∆q−1 ,
are related to each other by an equivalence relation such that there exists an R ∈
Uq (sl(2)) ⊗ Uq (sl(2)), called the universal R-matrix, satisfying the relation
∆q−1 (X ) = R∆q (X )R−1 .

(52)

This universal R-matrix is the central object of the quantum group theory. In this
case it can be shown that
R=q

(53)

If we insert the matrix representations of {X } in this expression for R we get
numerical R-matrices. For example, substituting in (53) the 2 × 2 representation of
{X }, given in (42), we get the fundamental 4-dimensional R-matrix

(54)

(55)

It is clear from (53) that this can be done. Now, define
R12 = R ⊗ 1l ,

R13 =
i

ai ui ⊗ 1l ⊗ vi ,

R23 = 1l ⊗ R .

(56)

Then, these satisfy the remarkable relation
R12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12 .

(57)

known as the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, or simply the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE).
We have considered only the simplest example of a quantum group, namely
SLq (2), associated with the classical group SL(2). There exists a systematic theory
of deformation of any classical group. It is also possible, in certain cases, to obtain
deformations with several q-parameters. Actually, the study of quantum groups
sheds more light on the structure of the classical group theory. I shall not go further
into the details of the formalism of quantum group theory.
Now, I am in a position to mention a few applications of quantum groups and
algebras. First, let us see how these things started. Define

method approach to integrable models in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. Substituting in (60) R from (54), and T1 and T2 from (58), it is found that
equation (60) is a compact way of stating the commutation relations (17) defining
the fundamental T -matrix of SLq (2). What about the commutation relations (44)
defining slq (2)? Define

L(−) =

L1

L2

= 1l ⊗ L(±) .

(61)

Then, the commutation relations (44), defining the generators of slq (2), can be
stated elegantly as

Note that the L(±) -matrices are special realizations of the T -matrices, i.e., the elements of L(±) -matrices obey the commutation relations required of the T -matrix
elements.

which is an alternative form of the YBE (57). For any general R-matrix the YBE (57)
can be put in this form (65). This relation (65) represents a property of the generators of a braid group which is a generalization of the well known symmetric group
Sn . The symmetric group Sn is the group of all permutations of n given objects. An
element of the braid group Bn can be depicted as a system of n strings joining two
sets of n points, each set located on a line, the two lines, say top and bottom, being
parallel, with over-crossings or under-crossings of the strings. The over-crossings
and the under-crossings of the strings make Bn an infinite group which will otherwise reduce to Sn . If i and i + 1 are two consecutive points on the top and bottom
lines, the string starting at i on the top line can reach i + 1 on the bottom line by
either under-crossing or over-crossing the string starting at i + 1 on the top line and
reaching i on the bottom line. The corresponding elements of the braid group are
usually denoted by σi and σi−1 , respectively. The elements {σi | i = 1, 2, · · · n − 1 } ,
generating the braid group Bn , satisfy two relations,
σi σj = σj σi

for |i − j| > 1 ,

(66)

and
σi σi+1 σi = σi+1 σi σi+1 .

(67)

Now, comparing the relations (65) and (67) it is obvious that the solutions of the
YBE (R-matrices), or the quantum algebras, should play a central role in the theory of representations of braid groups. Braid groups have many applications. In
mathematics they are useful in the study of complex functions of hypergeometric
type having several variables. In physics they appear in knot theory, statistical
mechanics, two-dimensional conformal field theory, and so on.
In quantum mechanics the notion of continuous space-time with commutative
coordinates is taken over from classical mechanics. This is an assumption. What will
happen if at some deeper microscopic level the space-time coordinates themselves are
noncommutative? It is clear that to deal with such a situation one will have to use a
noncommutative differential calculus and the theory of quantum groups provides the
necessary framework as we have seen above. For example, consider the motion of a
quantum particle in a two dimensional noncommutative plane with X and Y as the
coordinates. If we take the corresponding conjugate momenta to be proportional to
∂
∂
and ∂Y
, respectively, then the relations (14) indicate how the two-dimensional
∂X
11

quantum mechanical phase-space would be deformed at that level. Thus, the theory
of quantum groups would provide the mathematical framework for the future of
quantum physics if it turns out that at some deeper microscopic level space-time
manifold is noncommutative. Hence there has been a lot of interest in studying the
fundamental modifications that would occur in the framework quantum mechanics,
relativity theory, Poincar´e group, ..., etc., if the space-time manifold happens to be
noncommutative.
Apart from applications of fundamental nature, such as those mentioned above,
there have been many phenomenological applications of quantum algebras in nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, molecular physics, quantum optics, and
elementary particle physics. In these applications either an existing model is identified with a quantum algebraic structure, or a standard model is deformed to have
an underlying quantum algebraic structure and studied to reveal the new features
emerging. To give an idea of such applications, let me mention, as the final example, the q-deformation of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator algebra, also
known as the boson algebra. The algebraic treatment of the quantum mechanical
harmonic oscillator involves a creation operator a† , an annihilation operator (a),
and a number operator (N), obeying the commutation relations
N , a† = a† ,

a , a† = 1 ,

(68)

where N is a hermitian operator and a† is the hermitian conjugate of a. The energy
spectrum of the harmonic oscillator is given by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
operator
1
H=
aa† + a† a ,
(69)
2
in the appropriate units. Taking two such sets of oscillator operators, a1 , a†1 , N1
and a2 , a†2 , N2 , which are assumed to commute with each other, and defining
J0 =
it is found that

1
(N1 − N2 ) ,
2

J+ = a†1 a2 ,

J0† = J0 ,

J− = a†2 a1 ,

J+† = J− ,

(70)

(71)

and
[J0 , J± ] = ±J± ,

[J+ , J− ] = 2J0 .

(72)

This Lie algebra (72) is seen to be the same as the sl(2) algebra (45) subject to the
hermiticity conditions (71) and is known as su(2) algebra, the Lie algebra of the
group SU(2). The su(2) algebra is the algebra of three dimensional rotations, or
the rigid rotator, with {J0 , J± } representing the angular momentum operators. The
coproduct rule
∆ (J0 ) = J0 ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ J0 ,

∆ (J± ) = J± ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ J± ,

12

(73)

for the algebra (72), obtained by setting q = 1 in (47) (or (49)), represents the rule
for addition of angular momenta. Correspondingly, the relations (44) rewritten as
[J0 , J± ] = ±J± ,

[J+ , J− ] = [[2J0 ]]q ,

(74)

J+† = J− ,

(75)

with the hermiticity conditions
J0† = J0 ,

represent the suq (2) (or Uq (su(2))) algebra or the q-deformed version of the su(2)
algebra (72). One can say that suq (2) is the algebra of the q-rotator. For the
q-angular momentum operators there are two possible addition rules,
∆q±1 (J0 ) = J0 ⊗ 1l + 1l ⊗ J0 ,

∆q±1 (J± ) = J± ⊗ q ±J0 + q ∓J0 ⊗ J± ,

(76)

as seen from (47) and (49). Now the interesting fact is that one has a realization of
suq (2) generators given by
J0 =

1
(N1 − N2 ) ,
2

J+ = A†1 A2 ,

J− = A†2 A1 ,

(77)

exactly analogous to the su(2) case (70), where the two sets of operators
A1 , A†1 , N1 and A2 , A†2 , N2 commute with each other and obey, within each
set, the algebra
(78)
AA† − qA† A = q −N ,
N , A† = A† .
Further, N is hermitian and A , A† is a hermitian conjugate pair. The q-deformed
oscillator algebra (78) is known as the q-oscillator or the q-boson algebra. When
q −→ 1 the q-oscillator algebra (78) reduces to the canonical oscillator algebra (68).
As is easy to guess, phenomenological applications of quantum algebras in nuclear
and molecular spectroscopy involve the substitution of harmonic oscillator model
by the q-oscillator model and the rigid rotator model by the q-rotator model. Such
applications lead to impressive results showing that the actual vibrational-rotational
spectra of nuclei and molecules can be fit into schemes in which the number of phenomenological q-parameters required are very much fewer than the number of traditional phenomenological parameters required to fit the same spectral data. Somehow
such q-deformed models seem to take into account more efficiently the anharmonicity of vibrations and the nonrigidity of rotations in nuclear and molecular systems.
