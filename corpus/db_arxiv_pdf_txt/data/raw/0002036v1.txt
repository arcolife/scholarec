Abstract
For an intermediate mass Higgs boson with SM-like couplings the LHC
allows observation of a variety of decay channels in production by gluon fusion and weak boson fusion. Cross section ratios provide measurements of
various ratios of Higgs couplings, with accuracies of order 15% for 100 fb−1
of data in each of the two LHC experiments. For Higgs masses above
120 GeV, minimal assumptions on the Higgs sector allow for an indirect
measurement of the total Higgs boson width with an accuracy of 10 to
20%, and of the H → W W partial width with an accuracy of about 10%.

I. INTRODUCTION

Investigation of the symmetry breaking mechanism of the electroweak SU(2) × U(1)
gauge symmetry will be one of the prime tasks of the LHC. Correspondingly, major
efforts have been concentrated on devising methods for Higgs boson discovery, for the
< mH < 1 TeV,
entire mass range allowed within the Standard Model (SM) (100 GeV∼
∼
after LEP2), and for Higgs boson search in extensions of the SM, like the MSSM [1,2].
While observation of one or more Higgs scalar(s) at the LHC appears assured, discovery
will be followed by a more demanding task: the systematic investigation of Higgs boson
properties. Beyond observation of the various CP even and CP odd scalars which nature
may have in store for us, this means the determination of the couplings of the Higgs
boson to the known fermions and gauge bosons, i.e. the measurement of Htt, Hbb, Hτ τ
and HW W , HZZ, Hγγ couplings, to the extent possible.
Clearly this task very much depends on the expected Higgs boson mass. For mH >
200 GeV and within the SM, only the H → ZZ and H → W W channels are expected
to be observable, and the two gauge boson modes are related by SU(2). Above mH ≈
250 GeV, where detector effects will no longer dominate the mass resolution of the
H → ZZ → 4ℓ resonance, additional information is expected from a direct measurement
of the total Higgs boson width, ΓH . A much richer spectrum of decay modes is predicted
for the intermediate mass range, i.e. if a SM-like Higgs boson has a mass between the
< 110 GeV) and the Z-pair threshold. The main reasons for focusing
reach of LEP2 (∼
on this range are present indications from electroweak precision data, which favor mH <
250 GeV [3], as well as expectations within the MSSM, which predicts the lightest Higgs
< 130 GeV [4].

Until recently, the prospects of detailed and model independent coupling measurements at the LHC were considered somewhat remote [5], because few promising search
channels were known to be accessible, for any given Higgs boson mass. Taking ATLAS
search scenarios as an example, these were [1]

with the possibility of obtaining some additional information from processes like W H
and/or tt¯H associated production with subsequent H → ¯bb and H → γγ decay for Higgs
boson masses near 100 GeV. Throughout this paper, “gg → H” stands for inclusive Higgs
production, which is dominated by the gluon fusion process for a SM-like Higgs boson.
This relatively pessimistic outlook is changing considerably now, due to the demonstration that weak boson fusion is a promising Higgs production channel also in the
intermediate mass range. Previously, this channel had only been explored for Higgs
masses above 300 GeV. Specifically, it was recently shown in parton level analyses that
the weak boson fusion channels, with subsequent Higgs decay into photon pairs [6,7],

can be isolated at the LHC. Preliminary analyses, which try to extend these parton level
results to full detector simulations, look promising [11]. The weak boson fusion channels
utilize the significant background reductions which are expected from double forward jet
tagging [12–14] and central jet vetoing techniques [15,16], and promise low background
environments in which Higgs decays can be studied in detail. The parton level results
predict highly significant signals with (substantially) less than 100 fb−1 .

The prospect of observing several Higgs production and decay channels, over the
entire intermediate mass range, suggests a reanalysis of coupling determinations at the
LHC [5]. In this paper we attempt a first such analysis, for the case where the branching fractions of an intermediate mass Higgs resonance are fairly similar to the SM case,
i.e. we analyze a SM-like Higgs boson only. We make use of the previously published
analyses for the inclusive Higgs production channels [1,2] and of the weak boson fusion
channels [6–10]. The former were obtained by the experimental collaborations and include detailed detector simulations. The latter are based on parton level results, which
employ full QCD tree level matrix elements for all signal and background processes. We
will not discuss here differences in the performance expected for the ATLAS and CMS
detectors nor details in the theoretical assumptions which lead to different estimates for
expected signal and background rates. The reader is referred to the original publications from which numbers are extracted. In Section II we summarize expectations for
the various channels, including expected accuracies for cross section measurement of the
various signals for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 . Implications for the determination of coupling ratios and the measurement of Higgs boson (partial) decay widths are
then obtained in Section III. A final summary is given in Section IV.

II. SURVEY OF INTERMEDIATE MASS HIGGS CHANNELS

The various Higgs channels listed in Eqs. (1–6) and their observability at the LHC
have all been discussed in the literature. Where available, we give values as presently
quoted by the experimental collaborations. In order to compare the accuracy with which
the cross sections of different Higgs production and decay channels can be measured, we
need to unify these results. For example, K-factors of unity are assumed throughout.
Our goal in this section is to obtain reasonable estimates for the relative errors, ∆σH /σH ,
which are expected after collecting 100 fb−1 in each the ATLAS and the CMS detector,
i.e. we estimate results after a total of 200 fb−1 of data have been collected at the

LHC. Presumably these data will be taken with a mix of both low and high luminosity
running.
We find that the measurements are largely dominated by statistical errors. For all
channels, event rates with 200 fb−1 of data will be large enough to use the Gaussian
approximation for statistical errors. The experiments measure the signal cross section by
separately determining the combined signal + background rate, NS+B , and the expected
number of background events, NB . The signal cross section is then given by

Well below the H → W W threshold, the search for H → γγ events is arguably the
cleanest channel for Higgs discovery. LHC detectors have been designed for excellent
two-photon invariant mass resolution, with this Higgs signal in mind. We directly take
the expected signal and background rates for the inclusive H → γγ search from the
detailed studies of the CMS and ATLAS collaborations [17,18,1], which were performed
for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 in each detector. Expectations are summarized
in Table I. Rates correspond to not including a K-factor for the expected signal and
background cross sections in CMS and ATLAS. Cross sections have been determined
with MRS (R1) parton distribution functions (pdf’s) for CMS, while ATLAS numbers
are based on CTEQ2L pdf’s.
The inclusive H → γγ signal will be observed as a narrow γγ invariant mass peak
on top of a smooth background distribution. This means that the background can be
directly measured from the very high statistics background distribution in the sidebands.
We expect any systematic errors on the extraction of the signal event rate to be negligible
compared to the statistical errors which are given in the last row of Table I. With
100 fb−1 of data per experiment σ(gg → H) · B(H → γγ) can be determined with a
relative error of 10 to 15% for Higgs masses between 100 and 150 GeV. Here we do not
include additional systematic errors, e.g. from the luminosity uncertainty or from higher
order QCD corrections, because we will mainly consider cross section ratios in the final
analysis in the next Section. These systematic errors largely cancel in the cross section
ratios. Systematic errors common to several channels will be considered later, where
appropriate.
A Higgs search channel with a much better signal to background ratio, at the price of
lower statistics, however, is available via the inclusive search for H → ZZ ∗ → 4ℓ events.
Expected event numbers for 100 fb−1 in both ATLAS [1] and CMS [19] are listed in
Table II. These numbers were derived using CTEQ2L pdf’s and are corrected to contain

no QCD K-factor. For those Higgs masses where no ATLAS or CMS prediction is
available, we interpolate/extrapolate the results for the nearest Higgs mass, taking the
expected H → ZZ ∗ branching ratios into account for the signal. Similar to the case of
H → γγ events, the signal is seen as a narrow peak in the four-lepton invariant mass
distribution, i.e. the background can be extracted directly from the signal sidebands.
The combined relative error on the measurement of σ(gg → H)·B(H → ZZ ∗ ) is listed in
the last line of Table II. For Higgs masses in the 130–150 GeV range, and above Z-pair
threshold, a 10% statistical error on the cross section measurement is possible. In the
intermediate range, where H → W W dominates, and for lower Higgs masses, where the
Higgs is expected to dominantly decay into ¯bb, the error increases substantially.
Above mH ≈ 135 GeV, H → W W (∗) becomes the dominant SM Higgs decay channel. The resulting inclusive W W → ℓ+ νℓ− ν¯ signal is visible above backgrounds, after

correspond to optimized cuts, varying with the mass of the Higgs boson being searched for.
The expected relative errors on the signal cross section are given for each experiment, separating
the statistical error, the effect of a systematic 5% error of the background level, and the two
added in quadrature. The combined error for the two experiments assumes 100% correlation
of the systematic errors on the background determination.

exploiting the characteristic lepton angular correlations for spin zero decay into W pairs
near threshold [20]. The inclusive channel, which is dominated by gg → H → W W ,
has been analyzed by ATLAS for mH ≥ 150 GeV and for integrated luminosities of 30
and 100 fb−1 [1] and by CMS for mH ≥ 120 GeV and 30 fb−1 [20]. The expected event
numbers for 30 fb−1 are listed in Table III. The numbers are derived without QCD
K-factors and use CTEQ2L for ATLAS and MRS(A) pdf’s for CMS results.
Unlike the two previous modes, the two missing neutrinos in the H → W W events

do not allow for a reconstruction of the narrow Higgs mass peak. Since the Higgs signal
is only seen as a broad enhancement of the expected background rate in lepton-neutrino
transverse mass distributions, with similar shapes of signal and background after application of all cuts, a precise determination of the background rate from the data is not
possible. Rather one has to rely on background measurements in phase space regions
where the signal is weak, and extrapolation to the search region using NLO QCD predictions. The precise error on this extrapolation is unknown at present, the assumption
of a 5% systematic background uncertainty appears optimistic but attainable. It turns
out that with 30 fb−1 already, the systematic error starts to dominate, because the
background exceeds the signal rate by factors of up to 5, depending on the Higgs mass.
Running at high luminosity makes matters worse, because the less efficient reduction of
t¯t backgrounds, due to less stringent b-jet veto criteria, increases the background rate
further. Because of this problem we only present results for 30 fb−1 of low luminosity
running in Table III. Since neither of the LHC collaborations has presented predictions
for the entire Higgs mass range, we take CMS simulations below 150 GeV and ATLAS
√
results at 190 GeV, but divide the resultant statistical errors by a factor 2, to take
account of the presence of two experiments. Between 150 and 180 GeV we combine both
experiments, assuming 100% correlation in the systematic 5% normalization error of the
background.
The previous analyses are geared towards measurement of the inclusive Higgs production cross section, which is is dominated by the gluon fusion process. 15 to 20% of
the signal sample, however, is expected to arise from weak boson fusion, qq → qqH or
corresponding antiquark initiated processes. The weak boson fusion component can be
isolated by making use of the two forward tagging jets which are present in these events
and by vetoing additional central jets, which are unlikely to arise in the color singlet
signal process [15]. A more detailed discussion of these processes can be found in Ref. [7]
from which most of the following numbers are taken.

The qq → qqH, H → γγ process was first analyzed in Ref. [6], where cross sections
for signal and background were obtained with full QCD tree level matrix elements. The
parton level Monte Carlo determines all geometrical acceptance corrections. Additional
detector effects were included by smearing parton and photon 4-momenta with expected
detector resolutions and by assuming trigger, identification and reconstruction efficiencies of 0.86 for each of the two tagging jets and 0.8 for each photon. Resulting cross
sections were presented in Ref. [7] for a fixed γγ invariant mass window of total width
∆mγγ = 2 GeV. We correct these numbers for mH dependent mass resolutions in the
experiments. We take 1.4σ mass windows, as given in Ref. [1] for high luminosity running, which are expected to contain 79% of the signal events for ATLAS. The 2 GeV
window for mH = 100 GeV at CMS [17,18] is assumed to scale up like the ATLAS

resolution and assumed to contain 70% of the Higgs signal. The expected total signal
and background rates for 100 fb−1 and resulting relative errors for the extraction of the
signal cross section are given in Table IV. Statistical errors only are considered for the
background subtraction, since the background level can be measured independently by
considering the sidebands to the Higgs boson peak.
The next weak boson fusion channel to be considered is qq → qqH, H → τ τ . Again,
this channel has been analyzed at the parton level, including some estimates of detector
effects, as discussed for the H → γγ case. Here, a lepton identification efficiency of 0.95
is assumed for each lepton ℓ = e, µ. Two τ -decay modes have been considered so far:
H → τ τ → ℓ± h∓ p/T [8] and H → τ τ → e± µ∓p/T [9]. These analyses were performed
for low luminosity running. Some deterioration at high luminosity is expected, as in
the analogous H/A → τ τ channel in the MSSM search [1]. At high luminosity, pileup effects degrade the p/T resolution significantly, which results in a worse τ τ invariant
mass resolution. At a less significant level, a higher pT threshold for the minijet veto
technique will increase the QCD and tt¯ backgrounds. The τ -identification efficiency is
similar at high and low luminosity. We expect that the reduced performance at high
luminosity can be compensated for by considering the additional channels H → τ τ →

e+ e− p/T , µ+ µ−p/T . Z+jets and ZZ+jets backgrounds (with ZZ → ℓ+ ℓ− ν ν¯) are strongly
suppressed by rejecting same flavor lepton pairs which are compatible with Z decays
(mℓℓ = mZ ± 6 GeV). Drell-Yan plus jets backgrounds are further reduced by requiring
significant p/T . Since these analyses have not yet been performed, we use the predicted
cross sections for only those two channels which have already been discussed in the
literature and scale event rates to a combined 200 fb−1 of data. Results are given in
Table V.
The previous two weak boson channels allow reconstruction of the Higgs resonance as
an invariant mass peak. This is not the case for H → W W → ℓ+ νℓ− ν¯ as discussed previously for the inclusive search. The weak boson fusion channel can be isolated separately
by employing forward jet tagging and color singlet exchange isolation techniques in addition to tools like charged lepton angular correlations which are used for the inclusive
channel. The corresponding parton level analysis for qq → qqH, H → W W (∗) → µ± e∓ p/T
has been performed in Ref. [10] and we here scale the results to a total integrated luminosity of 200 fb−1 , which takes into account the availability of two detectors. As for the tau
case, the analysis was done for low luminosity running conditions and somewhat higher
backgrounds are expected at high luminosity. On the other hand the W W (∗) → µ+ µ− p/T
and W W (∗) → e+ e− p/T modes should roughly double the available statistics since very

12

few signal events have lepton pair invariant masses compatible with Z → ℓℓ decays.
Therefore our estimates are actually conservative. Note that the expected background
for this weak boson fusion process is much smaller than for the corresponding inclusive
measurement. As a result modest systematic uncertainties will not degrade the accuracy
with which σ(qq → qqH) · B(H → W W (∗) ) can be measured. A 10% systematic error
on the background, double the error assumed in the inclusive case, would degrade the
statistical accuracy by, typically, a factor 1.2 or less. As a result, we expect that a very
precise measurement of σ(qq → qqH) · B(H → W W (∗) ) can be performed at the LHC,
with a statistical accuracy of order 5% or even better in the mass range mH ≥ 140 GeV.
Even for mH as low as 120 GeV a 12% measurement is expected.

III. MEASUREMENT OF HIGGS PROPERTIES

One would like to translate the cross section measurements of the various Higgs production and decay channels into measurements of Higgs boson properties, in particular
into measurements of the various Higgs boson couplings to gauge fields and fermions.
This translation requires knowledge of NLO QCD corrections to production cross sections, information on the total Higgs decay width and a combination of the measurements
discussed previously. The task here is to find a strategy for combining the anticipated
LHC data without undue loss of precision due to theoretical uncertainties and systematic
errors.
For our further discussion it is convenient to rewrite all Higgs boson couplings in
terms of partial widths of various Higgs boson decay channels. The Higgs-fermion
couplings gHf f , for example, which in the SM are given by the fermion masses,
gHf f = mf (mH )/v, can be traded for the H → f¯f partial widths,

Here cf is the color factor (1 for leptons, 3 for quarks). Similarly the square of the
HW W coupling (gHW W = gmW in the SM) or the HZZ coupling is proportional to
13

the partial widths ΓW = Γ(H → W W ∗ ) or ΓZ = Γ(H → ZZ ∗ ) [21]. Analogously we
trade the squares of the effective Hγγ and Hgg couplings for Γγ = Γ(H → γγ) and
Γg = Γ(H → gg). Note that the Hgg coupling is essentially proportional to gHtt , the
Higgs’ coupling to the top quark.
The Higgs production cross sections are governed by the same squares of couplings.
This allows to write e.g. the gg → H production cross section as [22]
σ(gg → H) = Γ(H → gg)

where τ = m2H /s. Similarly the qq → qqH cross sections via W W and ZZ fusion are
proportional to Γ(H → W W ∗ ) and Γ(H → ZZ ∗ ), respectively. In the narrow width
approximation, which is appropriate for the intermediate Higgs mass range considered
here, these production cross sections need to be multiplied by the branching fractions
for final state j, B(H → j) = Γj /Γ, where Γ denotes the total Higgs width. This means
that the various cross section measurements discussed in the previous Section provide
measurements of various combinations Γi Γj /Γ.
The production cross sections are subject to QCD corrections, which introduces
theoretical uncertainties. While the K-factor for the gluon fusion process is large [23],
which suggests a sizable theoretical uncertainty on the production cross section, the
NLO corrections to the weak boson fusion cross section are essentially identical to the
ones encountered in deep inelastic scattering and are quite small [24]. Thus we can
assign a small theoretical uncertainty to the latter, of order 5%, while we shall use a
larger theoretical error for the gluon fusion process, of order 20% [23]. The problem for
weak boson fusion is that it consists of a mixture of ZZ → H and W W → H events,
and we cannot distinguish between the two experimentally. In a large class of models
the ratio of HW W and HZZ couplings is identical to the one in the SM, however, and
this includes the MSSM. We therefore make the following W, Z-universality assumption:
• The H → ZZ ∗ and H → W W ∗ partial widths are related by SU(2) as in the SM,
i.e. their ratio, z, is given by the SM value,
14

ΓZ = z ΓW = zSM ΓW .

(11)

Note that this assumption can be tested, at the 15-20% level for mH > 130 GeV,
by forming the ratio Bσ(gg → H → ZZ ∗ )/Bσ(gg → H → W W ∗ ), in which QCD
uncertainties cancel (see Table VII).
With W, Z-universality, the three weak boson fusion cross sections give us direct
measurements of three combinations of (partial) widths,

The first precision test of the Higgs sector is provided by taking ratios of the Xi ’s
and ratios of the Yi ’s. In these ratios the QCD uncertainties, and all other uncertainties
related to the initial state, like luminosity and pdf errors, cancel. Beyond testing W, Zuniversality, these ratios provide useful information for Higgs masses between 100 and
150 GeV and 120 to 150 GeV, respectively, where more than one channel can be observed
in the weak boson fusion and gluon fusion groups. Typical errors on these cross section
ratios are expected to be in the 15 to 20% range (see Table VII). Accepting an additional
systematic error of about 20%, a measurement of the ratio Γg /ΓW , which determines the
Htt to HW W coupling ratio, can be performed, by measuring the cross section ratios

ratio is indicated by ⊕. 5% and 20% theoretical uncertainties for weak boson and gluon fusion

the systematics coming from understanding detector acceptance is not included.
Beyond the measurement of coupling ratios, minimal additional assumptions allow
an indirect measurement of the total Higgs width. First of all, the τ partial width,
properly normalized, is measurable with an accuracy of order 10%. The τ is a third
generation fermion with isospin − 21 , just like the b-quark. In all extensions of the SM
with a common source of lepton and quark masses, even if generational symmetry is
broken, the ratio of b to τ Yukawa couplings is given by the fermion mass ratio. We thus

16

assume, in addition to W, Z-universality, that
• The ratio of b to τ couplings of the Higgs is given by their mass ratio, i.e.
y=

Γb
m2 (mH )
g2
,
= 3cQCD 2Hbb = 3cQCD b 2
Γτ

(18)

where cQCD is the known QCD and phase space correction factor.
• The total Higgs width is dominated by decays to ¯bb, τ τ , W W , ZZ, gg and γγ, i.e.
the branching ratio for unexpected channels is small:
ǫ = 1 − B(H → b¯b) + B(H → τ τ ) + B(H → W W (∗) ) +
B(H → ZZ (∗) ) + B(H → gg) + B(H → γγ)

≪1.

(19)

Note that, in the Higgs mass range of interest, these two assumptions are satisfied for
both CP even Higgs bosons in most of the MSSM parameter space. The first assumption
holds in the MSSM at tree level, but can be violated by large squark loop contributions,
in particular for small mA and large tan β [25,26]. The second assumption might be
violated, for example, if the H → c¯c partial width is exceptionally large. However, a
large up-type Yukawa coupling would be noticeable in the Γg /ΓW coupling ratio, which
measures the Htt coupling.
With these assumptions consider the observable

For a SM-like Higgs boson the Higgs width is dominated by the H → ¯bb and H → W W (∗)
˜ W is dominated by the uncertainties of the XW and Xτ
channels. Thus, the error on Γ
measurements and by the theoretical uncertainty on the b-quark mass, which enters the
determination of y quadratically. According to the Particle Data Group, the present
uncertainty on the b quark mass is about ±3.5% [27]. Assuming a luminosity error of
±5% in addition to the theoretical uncertainty of the weak boson fusion cross section of
±5%, the statistical errors of the qq → qqH, H → τ τ and qq → qqH, H → W W cross
˜ W determination of
sections of Tables V and VI lead to an expected accuracy of the Γ
order 10%. More precise estimates, as a function of the Higgs boson mass, are shown in
Fig. 1.
The extraction of the total Higgs width, via Eq. (21), requires a measurement of
the qq → qqH, H → W W (∗) cross section, which is expected to be available for mH >
∼
115 GeV [10]. Consequently, errors are large for Higgs masses close to this lower limit
(we expect a relative error of ≈ 20% for mH = 120 GeV and ǫ < 0.05). But for Higgs
boson masses around the W W threshold, Γ(1 − ǫ)2 can be determined with an error of
about 10%. Results are shown in Fig. 1 and look highly promising.

IV. SUMMARY

In the last section we have found that various ratios of Higgs partial widths can
be measured with accuracies of order 10 to 20%, with an integrated luminosity of 100
fb−1 per experiment. This translates into 5 to 10% measurements of various ratios
of coupling constants. The ratio Γτ /ΓW measures the coupling of down-type fermions
relative to the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons. To the extent that the Hγγ triangle
diagrams are dominated by the W loop, the width ratio Γτ /Γγ measures the same
relationship. The fermion triangles leading to an effective Hgg coupling are expected to

be dominated by the top-quark, thus, Γg /ΓW probes the coupling of up-type fermions
relative to the HW W coupling. Finally, for Higgs boson masses above ≈ 120 GeV,
the absolute normalization of the HW W coupling is accessible via the extraction of the
H → W W (∗) partial width in weak boson fusion.
Note that these measurements test the crucial aspects of the Higgs sector. The
HW W coupling, being linear in the Higgs field, identifies the observed Higgs boson as
the scalar responsible for the spontaneous breaking of SU(2) × U(1): a scalar without a
vacuum expectation value couples to gauge bosons only via HHW W or HHW vertices
at tree level, i.e. the interaction is quadratic in scalar fields. The absolute value of the
HW W coupling, as compared to the SM expectation, reveals whether H may be the only
mediator of spontaneous symmetry breaking or whether additional Higgs bosons await
19

discovery. Within the framework of the MSSM this is a measurement of | sin(β − α)|,
at the ±0.05 level. The measurement of the ratios of gHtt /gHW W and gHτ τ /gHW W then
probes the mass generation of both up and down type fermions.
The results presented here constitute a first look only at the issue of coupling extractions for the Higgs. This is the case for the weak boson fusion processes in particular,
which prove to be extremely valuable if not essential. Our analysis is mostly an estimate
of statistical errors, with some rough estimates of the systematic errors which are to be
expected for the various measurements of (partial) widths and their ratios. A number
of issues need to be addressed in further studies, in particular with regard to the weak
boson fusion channels.
(a) The weak boson fusion channels and their backgrounds have only been studied
at the parton level, to date. Full detector level simulations, and optimization of
strategies with more complete detector information is crucial for further progress.
(b) A central jet veto has been suggested as a powerful tool to suppress QCD backgrounds to the color singlet exchange processes which we call weak boson fusion.
The feasibility of this tool and its reach need to be investigated in full detector
studies, at both low and high luminosity.
(c) In the weak boson fusion studies of H → W W and H → τ τ decays, double leptonic e+ e− p/T and µ+ µ−p/T signatures have not yet been considered. Their inclusion
promises to almost double the statistics available for the Higgs coupling measurements, at the price of additional ZZ+jets and Drell-Yan plus jets backgrounds
which are expected to be manageable.
(d) Other channels, like W H or tt¯H associated production with subsequent decay
H → ¯bb or H → γγ, provide additional information on Higgs coupling ratios,
< 120 GeV [2,5].
which complement our analysis at small Higgs mass values, mH ∼
These channels need to be included in the analysis.
20

(e) Much additional work is needed on more reliable background determinations. For
′

the H → W W (∗) → ℓ+ ℓ − p/T channel in particular, where no narrow Higgs resonance peak can be reconstructed, a precise background estimate is crucial for
the measurement of Higgs couplings. Needed improvements include NLO QCD
corrections, single top quark production backgrounds, the combination of shower
Monte Carlo programs with higher order QCD matrix element calculations and
more.
(f) Both in the inclusive and WBF analyses any given channel contains a mixture of
events from gg → H and qq → qqH production processes. The determination
of this mixture adds another source of systematic uncertainty, which was not included in the present study. In ratios of X observables (or of different Yi ) these
uncertainties largely cancel, except for the effects of acceptance variations due to
different signal selections. Since an admixture from the wrong production channel
is expected at the 10 to 20% level only, these systematic errors are not expected
to be serious.
(g) We have only analyzed the case of a single neutral, CP even Higgs resonance with
couplings which are close to the ones predicted in the SM. While this case has many
applications, e.g. for the large mA region of the MSSM, more general analyses, in
particular of the MSSM case, are warranted and highly promising.
While much additional work is needed, our study clearly shows that the LHC has
excellent potential to provide detailed and accurate information on Higgs boson interactions. The observability of the Higgs boson at the LHC has been clearly established,
within the SM and extensions like the MSSM. The task now is to sharpen the tools for
accurate measurements of Higgs boson properties at the LHC.
