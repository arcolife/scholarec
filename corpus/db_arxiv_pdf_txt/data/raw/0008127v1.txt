Abstract
This thesis presents a theoretical analysis of the properties of the Higgs bosons in the Standard Model (SM) and the minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM), which can be investigated at the LHC and e+ e− linear colliders. The final goal is the reconstruction of the Higgs
potential and thus the verification of the Higgs mechanism. MSSM Higgs boson production
processes at future γγ colliders are calculated in several decay channels. Heavy scalar and
pseudoscalar Higgs bosons can be discovered in the b¯b final state in the investigated mass
range 200 to 800 GeV for moderate and large values of tan β. The τ + τ − channel provides
a heavy Higgs boson discovery potential for large values of tan β. Several mechanisms that
can be exploited at e+ e− linear colliders for the measurement of the lifetime of a SM Higgs
boson in the intermediate mass range are analysed. In the W W mode, the lifetime of Higgs
scalars with masses below ∼ 160 GeV can be determined with an error less than 10%. The
reconstruction of the Higgs potential requires the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings.
The SM and MSSM trilinear Higgs self-couplings are accessible in double and triple Higgs
production. A theoretical analysis is presented in the relevant channels at the LHC and e+ e−
linear colliders. For high luminosities, the SM trilinear Higgs self-coupling can be measured
with an accuracy of 20% at a 500 GeV e+ e− linear collider. The MSSM coupling among
three light Higgs bosons has to be extracted from continuum production. The other trilinear
Higgs couplings are measurable in a restricted range of the MSSM parameter space. At the
LHC, the Hhh coupling can be probed in resonant decays.

Zusammenfassung
Diese Doktorarbeit pr¨asentiert eine theoretische Analyse der Eigenschaften von Higgsteilchen
im Standard Modell (SM) und der minimalen supersymmetrischen Erweiterung (MSSM), die
am LHC und e+ e− Linearcollidern untersucht werden k¨onnen. Das Ziel ist, das Higgspotential zu rekonstruieren und dadurch den Higgsmechanismus zu u
¨ berpr¨
ufen. F¨
ur die MSSM
Higgs-Boson Produktion an zuk¨
unftigen γγ-Beschleunigern werden Prozesse in verschiedenen Zerfallskan¨alen berechnet. Schwere skalare und pseudoskalare Higgs-Bosonen k¨onnen
im b¯b Endzustand im gesamten untersuchten Massenbereich von 200 bis 800 GeV f¨
ur mit+ −
tlere und große Werte von tan β entdeckt werden. Der τ τ Kanal erlaubt die Entdeckung
von schweren Higgs-Bosonen f¨
ur große Werte von tan β. Es werden mehrere Mechanismen
ur die Lebensdauerbestimmung eines Higgsuntersucht, die an e+ e− Linearbeschleunigern f¨
Bosons im intermedi¨aren Massenbereich verwendet werden k¨onnen. Im W W -Kanal kann
die Lebensdauer von Higgs-Skalaren, die leichter als ∼ 160 GeV sind, mit einem Fehler von
weniger als 10% bestimmt werden. Die Rekonstruktion des Higgspotentials erfordert die
Messung der Higgs-Selbstkopplungen. Die trilinearen Higgs-Kopplungen des SM und des
MSSM sind in der Produktion von zwei und drei Higgsteilchen zug¨anglich. Es wird eine
theoretische Analyse in den am LHC und an e+ e− Linearbeschleunigern relevanten Kan¨alen
durchgef¨
uhrt. Bei hohen Luminosit¨aten kann die trilineare Higgs-Selbstkopplung des SM mit
einer Genauigkeit von 20% an einem 500 GeV e+ e− Linearbeschleuniger gemessen werden.
Die MSSM Kopplung zwischen drei leichten Higgs-Bosonen muß in der Kontinuumsproduktion ermittelt werden. Die u
¨ brigen trilinearen Kopplungen sind in einem eingeschr¨ankten
Parameterbereich des MSSM-Parameterraumes meßbar. Am LHC kann die Hhh-Kopplung
in resonanten Zerf¨allen untersucht werden.

Introduction
The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) combines the electroweak and strong interactions based on the local SU(3) × SU(2)L × U(1)Y gauge group. The electroweak gauge
fields W ± , Z and the photon field A correspond to the four generators of the non-abelian
SU(2)L × U(1)Y gauge group whereas the eight generators of the colour group SU(3) are
associated with the equivalent number of gluons. The interaction between matter and gauge
fields is incorporated in the theory by minimal substitution which replaces the partial derivatives in the Lagrangean with the covariant ones including the couplings related to the various
gauge groups. At this stage matter and gauge fields are still massless in contradiction to
the experimental observation. Introducing explicit mass terms, however, would violate the
gauge invariance and lead to a non-renormalizable theory with an infinite number of parameters to be adjusted by the experiment. Another difficulty arises due to the violation of the
unitarity bounds at high energies by the scattering amplitudes of the massive W ± /Z bosons
and fermions.
A way out is provided by introducing an additional weak isodoublet scalar field [1–4].
One of the four degrees of freedom corresponds to a physical particle, the so-called Higgs
boson. The self-interaction of the scalar field leads to an infinite√number of degenerate
ground states with non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) v = ( 2GF )−1/2 ≈ 246 GeV.
By choosing one of them as physical ground state, the SU(2)L × U(1)Y symmetry is hidden
with the U(1)em symmetry left over. The Higgs couplings to other particles are defined
by the constraint set by unitarity. Through the interaction with the scalar field in the
ground state, the electroweak gauge bosons and the fundamental matter particles acquire
their masses. The non-vanishing field strength, essential for the non-zero particle masses,
is induced by the typical minimax form of the Higgs potential. After the ”spontaneous
symmetry breaking” the three Goldstone bosons among the four degrees of freedom of the
Higgs doublet are absorbed to provide the longitudinal modes for the massive Z and W ±
gauge bosons. Since all the Higgs couplings are predetermined, the parameters describing
the Higgs particle are entirely fixed by its mass. This is the only unknown parameter in the
SM Higgs sector [3, 4].
The Standard Model is in very good agreement with electroweak precision tests at LEP,
SLC, Tevatron and HERA. In some cases it has been tested to an accuracy better than
0.1%. Up to now, the only deviation from the Standard Model has been the experimental
indication of massive neutrinos, which can be embedded in the SM by introducing a mass
term for neutrinos in the Yukawa Lagrangean. This strongly limits possible forms of new

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

physics. Models that preserve the SM structure (extended by the neutrino mass term) are to
be favoured. In this respect a promising candidate for possible extensions is supersymmetry
[3, 5, 6].
In view of the impressing success of the SM one may ask of course why to consider
extensions to new physics. The reason is that the SM implies many unanswered questions.
The extrapolation of the model to high energies indicates a unification of all three gauge
couplings at mass scales of the order of MGU T ∼ 1014 −1016 GeV [7] (Grand Unified Theories
GUT’s). If one assumes new physics to set in at the GUT scale,
SM will be valid in a mass
√ the −1/2
range between the relative small weak scale of the order of ( 2GF )
≈ 246 GeV set by the
Higgs mechanism and MGU T given by the grand unification scale. Quantum fluctuations,
however, lead to large corrections of the Higgs mass at high scales. In order to keep the
Higgs mass stable in the presence of the large GUT scale, the considerable corrections have
to be absorbed in the mass counterterms leading to a finetuning of the Higgs parameters.
A stabilization of the separation between the electroweak and the GUT scale is provided by
the introduction of supersymmetry (SUSY) which incorporates the most general symmetry
of the S-matrix. Within the framework of supersymmetry the masses of the scalar particles
remain moderate even in the presence of high energy scales. This is due to supersymmetry
representing a connection between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom so that quantum
corrections arising from the two particle types cancel each other. Even in softly broken
supersymmetry the leading quadratic singularities vanish and are replaced by logarithmic
divergences. Furthermore, SUSY GUT’s lead to a prediction of the electroweak mixing angle
[8] that is in very good agreement with present high-precision measurements of sin2 θW . A
minimal realization of supersymmetry is given by the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of
the Standard Model, the MSSM [3, 5, 6].
The Higgs mechanism described above is a basic ingredient of the electroweak sector both
of the Standard Model and the MSSM. So far, however, it has not been verified experimentally. In order to establish this most important aspect for the consistent formulation of an
electroweak theory experimentally, three steps have to be performed.
1. First of all the Higgs particle(s) must be discovered.
2. In a second step, the Higgs couplings to the fermions and gauge particles have to be
determined via the partial decay widths and the Higgs production cross sections.
3. In order to finally reconstruct the Higgs potential, the trilinear and quadrilinear Higgs
self-couplings have to be measured.
The discovery of a scalar particle alone will not reveal the mechanism by which the fundamental particle masses are generated. Only the knowledge of the Higgs self-interaction will
allow for the determination of the explicit form of the Higgs potential.
In this work the procedure for the experimental verification of the Higgs sector will be
analysed. For this task the picture of the Higgs particle will be evolved in the three steps
described in the previous paragraph. For reasons resumed above not only the SM but also
a supersymmetric extension, the MSSM which involves five physical Higgs particles [3, 5, 6],
will be considered. The theoretical foundations will be developed and the experimental
implications at the Large Hadron Collider [9], which is constructed for a c.m. energy of
14 TeV, and at high energy e+ e− linear colliders [10] will be discussed. The total integrated

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

luminosity for the LHC is L = 100 fb−1 after 3 years. e+ e− linear colliders are planned to
run in the energy range between 500 GeV and 1 TeV, possibly extending later up to 5 TeV.
For the TESLA design this corresponds to an integrated luminosity of L = 300 fb−1 per
year at 500 GeV and of 500 fb−1 for a c.m. energy of 800 GeV [10].
The structure of the thesis which reflects the experimental scheme to be pursued is as
follows. Chapter 2 will start with the setting of the scene by describing the SM Higgs
couplings and the MSSM Higgs sector from the theoretical point of view.
The third Chapter will be devoted to the Higgs boson search at pp colliders and in e+ e−
collisions. First, the production mechanisms will be reviewed before turning on to the perspectives for the Higgs discovery in the diverse decay channels at the two collider types. The
final picture will display a parameter region in which the discovery of the heavy MSSM Higgs
bosons will be difficult if not impossible. Therefore the production and discovery potential in
the γγ mode at e+ e− linear colliders will be analysed. Using Weizs¨acker-Williams photons for
the production of Higgs bosons provides too small a number of events. The rate is sufficiently
large, however, if the photons are produced through the backscattering of laser light from
high-energy electron/positron beams. This mechanism [11] allows for the production of
real photons with high energy, luminosity [12] and monochromaticity and a high degree of
polarization of the scattered photons. Several decay channels will be examined with regard
to a sufficiently large signal to background ratio. Next-to-leading order corrections will be
included and where necessary the resummation of large logarithms will thoroughly be taken
into account.
Once the Higgs boson will be discovered and its mass will be determined, the next step
is the measurement of the Higgs couplings to the gauge and matter particles via the Higgs
decays. Chapter 4 will present the branching ratios for the various decay channels of the SM
Higgs scalar and the MSSM Higgs bosons. The knowledge of the branching ratios and the
decay widths allows for the extraction of the lifetime of the Higgs bosons, which together with
the mass forms the basic characteristics of particles. Therefore, Chapter 4 will continue with
evolving the theoretical set-up for the determination of the SM and MSSM Higgs lifetimes
in a model-independent way. Some representative examples at e+ e− colliders will be given.
The first Chapters describe the determination of the necessary ingredients, i.e. the mass
and lifetime of the Higgs states and the Yukawa and gauge-Higgs boson couplings, from a
theoretical and experimental point of view, enabling finally the measurement of the Higgs
self-couplings. Chapter 5 deals with this task which is essential in order to establish experimentally the Higgs sector harboring the mechanism for the generation of particle masses.
Special emphasis will hence be on this part of the thesis. The plethora of mechanisms which
allow the access to the trilinear Higgs self-couplings in pp and e+ e− collisions will be described. The final picture unveils a theoretically conclusive way of determining all possible
trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the SM and the MSSM. The size of the cross sections for these
processes will be discussed including a short sideview on the ones involving self-couplings
among four Higgs particles. The phenomenological implications, in particular the perspectives for the measurement of the trilinear Higgs self-couplings will be examined by reviewing
existing background studies.
The thesis will be concluded with a summary of the salient features of the investigation
of the Higgs sector in the SM and the MSSM.

The SM and the MSSM Higgs sector
2.1

The Higgs particle of the Standard Model

The dynamics of the SU(2)L Higgs doublet field Φ, introduced in order to ensure unitarity
and to provide a mechanism for the generation of masses without violating gauge principles,
is described by the Lagrangean
LΦ = (Dµ Φ)† (D µ Φ) − V (Φ)

(2.1)

where V denotes the Higgs self-interaction potential

the potential Eq. (2.2) can be cast into the form

λ
VH = (2λv 2 )H 2 + λvH 3 + H 4

(2.4)

where the Higgs mass MH and the Higgs self-interactions can be read off directly. Apparently,
the Higgs mass
√
(2.5)
MH = 2λv
is related to the quadrilinear coupling λ. The trilinear Higgs self-coupling can be expressed
as
λHHH = 3MH2 /MZ2

(2.6)

in units of λ0 = MZ2 /v and the self-coupling among four Higgs bosons in units of λ20 is given
by
λHHHH = 3MH2 /MZ4

(2.7)

where λ0 = 33.8 GeV, numerically. For a typical energy scale MZ and a Higgs mass MH =
110 GeV, the trilinear Higgs self-coupling equals to λHHH λ0 /MZ = 1.6. In contrast, the
5

CHAPTER 2. THE SM AND THE MSSM HIGGS SECTOR

quadrilinear coupling λHHHH λ20 = 0.6 is suppressed compared to the trilinear coupling by a
factor of about the weak gauge coupling. Evidently, in the SM the Higgs self-couplings are
uniquely defined by the mass of the Higgs boson.
The covariant derivative in (2.1) is given by
Dµ = i∂µ + gTa Wµa − g ′

(2.8)

and (Dµ Φ)† (D µ Φ) hence describes the kinetic Higgs term and the interaction between Higgs
and gauge bosons. Ta (a = 1, 2, 3) denote the isospin-generators of the SU(2)L gauge group
and Y corresponds to the U(1)Y hypercharge-generator. g and g ′ are the electroweak couplings and Wµa and Bµ are the gauge fields associated with the two symmetry groups, respectively. After introducing the physical Higgs field (2.3) and transforming the electroweak
eigenstates Wµa , Bµ to the mass eigenstates, the kinetic term in Eq. (2.1) yields the mass
terms for the electroweak gauge bosons W ± , Z and the photon field A

The interaction between the Higgs boson and fermions must respect the SU(2)L × U(1)Y
gauge symmetry and maintain the renormalizability of the theory. The operators which
fulfill these conditions are combined in the Yukawa Lagrangean

The right-handed fermions denoted by the index R behave as singlets under SU(2)L -transformations whereas the left-handed fermions denoted by the index L are combined in isospindoublets. The prime indicates that the corresponding quarks are given in the electroweak
basis which is connected to the basis of the mass eigenstates via the unitary CabibboKobayashi-Maskawa matrix V [13], D ′ = V D. The 3 × 3 matrices CE , CU , CD are unitary.
By appropriate change of the basis (E, U, D′) with a constant U(3)-matrix and making
use of the unitarity of the matrices Ci , Eq. (2.11) provides the fermion mass terms mf
after expanding Φ around the VEV, cf. Eq. (2.3). They are related to the Higgs fermion
interaction coefficient via
√
λHf f = ( 2GF )1/2 mf
(2.14)
Taking into account the recent indication of massive neutrinos one possibility to include
them in the theory is the addition of an operator containing right-handed Dirac neutrinos
to the Yukawa Lagrangean:

N

(2.15)

CHAPTER 2. THE SM AND THE MSSM HIGGS SECTOR

and changing the mass eigenstates E to electroweak eigenstates E ′ ,
E → E′

(2.16)

This Yukawa Lagrangean leads then to a Dirac mass term for neutrinos and furthermore
encounters a ”Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa” matrix VE for charged leptons transforming
the electroweak eigenstates E ′ to mass eigenstates E:
E ′ = VE E

(2.17)

There are also other possibilities of implementing massive neutrinos in the theory.

2.2

Supersymmetry

2.2.1

The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

In the minimal realization of a supersymmetric theory, the MSSM, a minimal number of supersymmetric particles is introduced as partners to the SM particles. The scalar partners of
quarks and leptons are called squarks and sleptons with the degrees of freedom corresponding to the degrees of freedom of the SM states. The fermions and their supersymmetric
partners are combined in chiral superfields. For reasons described below, the MSSM which
includes the same SU(3) × SU(2)L × U(1)Y gauge symmetry as the SM contains two SU(2)L
Higgs doublets. They are associated with SU(2)L doublets of Majorana fermion fields, the
higgsinos. The electroweak gauge bosons and the gluons also acquire SUSY partners with
spin 1/2, which are called gauginos and gluinos, respectively. Charginos and neutralinos are
the physical mass eigenstates of the higgsinos and gauginos and are given by linear combinations of these fields. Gauge bosons and their supersymmetric partners are described by
vector superfields. The particles in a superfield differ only by spin 1/2. Since supersymmetry
relates fermions and bosons, the particles in a supermultiplet have equal masses and residual
quantum numbers in an unbroken supersymmetric theory.
The superfields are introduced in order to build up the supersymmetric Lagrangean, and
the space-time integral over the Lagrange density is extended to a superspace integral which
involves two more dimensions. They correspond to two-component Grassmann variables,

developing the component fields of the supermultiplets as coefficients in these finite series.
The so-called F term is the one proportional to θθ in the expansion of the chiral superfield.
The D term represents the contribution proportional θ2 θ¯2 in the vector superfield expansion
[5]. Starting with a theory without gauge fields, the supermultiplets can be described using
chiral superfields Φi only. Since a renormalizable theory must not contain higher orders than
three in Φi , the Lagrangean for chiral superfields is given by

The superpotential as given in (2.19) implies lepton and baryon number violating interactions which may lead to proton decay at tree level by exchanging a s-down-quark. In the
SM, no such problem occurs since the corresponding interactions do not arise due to gauge
invariance unless the dimension of the operators is larger than six. In order to avoid the
problem in the MSSM, the corresponding couplings must either be suppressed or the interactions must be forbidden by a symmetry. The Z2 symmetry under which the Grassmann
variables in the Lagrangean change sign fulfills this condition. The symmetry is called R
parity and characterized by a multiplicative quantum number which can be defined as
R = (−1)(3B+L+2S)

(2.30)

where B is the baryon number, L the lepton number and S the spin of the particle. The
SM particles have R parity +1 whereas their SUSY partners have R parity −1. From the
phenomenological point of view, the assumption of R parity conservation implies that SUSY
partners can only be pair produced in collisions of SM particles. Furthermore, a theory with
R parity conservation contains a lightest SUSY particle (LSP) which is stable.
So far no SUSY particle with the same mass as its corresponding SM partner has been
observed. In order to explain the experiments the SUSY particles must be assumed to be
heavier than their SM counterparts. Hence supersymmetry has to be broken. For the time
being, supersymmetry is usually broken by introducing explicit soft mass terms [17] and
regarding the MSSM as an effective low energy theory [18]. The mass terms are called soft
because they are chosen such that they do not develop quadratic divergences again. The
form of the soft-breaking terms is restricted by the requirement of gauge invariance as well
as weak-scale R parity invariance and stable scalar masses. A further constraint is set by
the experimental bounds. In generic notation they are given by

with the minimum given by 0|ηi |0 = 0. Diagonalizing the mass matrix (2.44) the masses

(2.48)

When radiative corrections are taken into account the upper bound of the light neutral Higgs
mass Mh will extend to about 130 GeV [20, 21]. In contrast, the masses of the heavy CPeven and CP-odd neutral Higgs bosons H, A, and the charged Higgs particles H ± may vary
in the mass range from the order of the electroweak symmetry scale v up to about 1 TeV.
After introducing the physical Higgs states the self-couplings among the Higgs bosons can
be derived from (2.36). Respecting CP-invariance there are six trilinear couplings among the

2.2.3

The Higgs-Yukawa and the Higgs-gauge couplings

The couplings of the MSSM Higgs particles to the fermions and gauge bosons can be derived
in the framework of the superspace formalism from the Yukawa Lagrangean and the kinetic
term for the two Higgs doublets, respectively [3, 5, 6]. The procedure is analogous to the
SM bearing in mind that two SU(2)L complex scalar doublets are involved in the MSSM.
Expanding around the VEVs and transforming to the Higgs mass eigenstates, the couplings
given in Table 2.1 will be found normalized to the SM [3, 5, 6]. They depend on the ratio
of the vacuum expectation values, tan β, and the mixing angle α which was introduced in

order to diagonalize the mass matrix in the neutral CP-even Higgs sector.
The Higgs gauge couplings ghV V and gHV V are suppressed with respect to the corresponding SM couplings by the factors sin(β − α) and cos(β − α), respectively. Only in the
decoupling limit the light CP-even Higgs boson gauge coupling approaches the SM value
whereas the coupling for H becomes zero. For the pseudoscalar Higgs particle A there exists
no coupling to the gauge bosons at tree level due to CP-invariance.
The Yukawa gauge couplings of the CP-even neutral MSSM Higgs bosons to up- (down-)
type quarks are inversely proportional to sin β (cos β). Their variation with MA is shown
for two values of tan β = 3, 50 in Fig. 2.1. Evidently, for large values of MA , i.e. in the
decoupling limit, the couplings involving h approach the SM values whereas for small values
of MA this rˆole is taken over by the heavy CP-even Higgs boson H. The Yukawa couplings
of the CP-odd Higgs boson A to up- (down-)type quarks are suppressed (enhanced) for large
values of tan β.
The couplings in Table 2.1 determine the decay modes of the MSSM Higgs bosons and
therefore their experimental signatures. Thus it will be difficult in the decoupling limit to
distinguish the light scalar MSSM Higgs boson from the SM Higgs particle.

CHAPTER 2. THE SM AND THE MSSM HIGGS SECTOR

Chapter 3
Higgs boson search
The mass of the Higgs boson cannot be predicted within the framework of the SM. Its value
can be constrained, however, by the assumption that the model is valid up to an energy
scale Λ. Demanding that the SM remains perturbative up to the GUT scale O(1016 GeV),
an upper bound of the Higgs mass is given by ∼ 200 GeV. For Λ ∼ 1 TeV and the constraint
MH ≤ Λ lattice simulations [24] and renormalization group analyses [25, 26] predict an upper
bound of ∼ 700 GeV.

A lower bound on the Higgs mass is given by the requirement of vacuum stability. The
quantum corrections to the quartic self-coupling λ due to the Higgs self-interaction are
positive whereas those from the top-Yukawa coupling are negative. Depending on the value
of λ at the scale of the Higgs mass the quartic coupling increases with the energy or is driven
to negative values so that the vacuum becomes unstable depending on the top-quark mass.
Since the strength of the Higgs self-interaction is determined by the Higgs mass at the scale
MH the negative contribution can be compensated if MH is large enough. Assuming a top
mass of 175 GeV the SM remains weakly interacting up to ∼ 1 TeV if the lower bound of the
Higgs mass is given by ∼ 55 GeV. For Λ ∼ MGUT the lower bound increases to 130 GeV. If
the vacuum is metastable with a lifetime exceeding the age of the universe, the lower Higgs
mass bound decreases. While the bound changes only slightly for Λ ∼ MGUT , the effect is
significant for Λ ∼ 1 TeV [25].

The direct Higgs boson search in the Higgs-strahlung process at LEP2 , finally, constrains
the Higgs mass from below [27]. The search will possibly be extended up to Higgs masses of
∼ 115 GeV.

In the MSSM, the Higgs sector at tree level is completely described by the electroweak
parameters and two additional parameters MA and tan β, so that an upper bound for the
light scalar Higgs mass can be derived, cf. (2.48).

The crucial test for the existence of the Higgs particles will be their experimental discovery.
In this chapter an overview will be presented over the SM and the MSSM Higgs boson search
strategies at pp colliders and at e+ e− linear colliders. Subsequently, the heavy MSSM Higgs
particle production in the Compton mode of an e+ e− linear collider will be examined in
detail taking into account the background reactions and interference effects. These processes
are important for the search of heavy MSSM Higgs particles in parameter regions that are
difficult to exploit at the LHC and in e+ e− collisions.

range up to 1 TeV apart from vector boson fusion which is of the same order of magnitude
above 800 GeV. For Higgs masses less than about 100 GeV Higgs-strahlung and associated
production with tt¯ become competitive with vector boson fusion and provide additional
production mechanisms for the Higgs boson.

For masses 160 ∼

boson search can be supplemented by the dominant decay H → W W with lνlν final states.

If the Higgs mass is large the Higgs boson becomes very broad with a width of up to
600 GeV for MH = 1 TeV. This implies a broad resonance peak in the final state and due
to the reduced phase space the event rates decrease for a heavy Higgs boson. Since the
channels H → ZZ → lνlν and H → W W → lνjj involve larger branching ratios than
the ’gold-plated’ decay they provide a means of detecting the Higgs particle in the range
MH >
∼ 800 GeV.
For an integrated luminosity of 300 fb−1 , the expected precision for the mass measurement
will be 0.1% in the Higgs mass range 80-400 GeV [9, 31].
Fig. 3.4 shows the cross sections for the various Higgs production mechanisms at the
Tevatron as a function of the Higgs mass for a c.m. energy of 2 TeV. The most important
process for the Higgs search is Higgs-strahlung off W, Z bosons, q q¯ → W ∗ /Z ∗ → W/Z +
H. Due to the lower luminosity and the large backgrounds at the Tevatron several search
channels have to be combined and the statistical power of both experiments CDF and D0
has to be exploited in order to reach significances above three for the detection of the Higgs
boson in certain mass windows. For an integrated luminosity of 20 fb−1 as might be expected

in RUNIIb a Higgs boson with mass up to ∼ 180 GeV can be detected at the 3σ level using
neural network selection for the investigated channels. A 5σ discovery will only be possible
below ∼ 120 GeV. The Higgs can be excluded up to ∼ 190 GeV with 95% CL [33].

3.1.2

Supersymmetric extension

Except for vector boson fusion and Higgs-strahlung the production of the MSSM Higgs
bosons proceeds via the same mechanisms as in the SM case taking into account that contributions due to b-quarks may also play a rˆole for large tan β where the Yukawa couplings
to down-type quarks are enhanced, cf. Table 2.1 and Fig. 2.1. The production via vector
boson fusion and Higgs-strahlung is only possible for CP-even Higgs bosons since the CP-odd
boson A does not interact with the the vector particles at tree level.
In the MSSM the gluon fusion process proceeds dominantly via top- and bottom-quark
loops with the b-quark contribution becoming of the same size as that due to the top-quark
for large tan β. Squarks are also involved. However, for large squark masses they decouple.
Since the scalar Higgs vector boson couplings are suppressed with sin(β − α), cos(β − α)
compared to the corresponding SM couplings the production cross sections for the MSSM
scalar Higgs bosons in vector boson fusion are smaller than the SM fusion cross sections.
Analogously, the associated production with W/Z is smaller than in the SM case and has
only to be considered for the light CP-even Higgs boson and the heavier one provided its
mass is small. As can be inferred from Table 2.1 and Fig. 2.1 the MSSM Higgs tt¯ couplings
are below the SM counterpart for tan β > 1 so that associated production with tt¯ will always
yield smaller cross sections than in the SM. Yet, the same process involving a b¯b pair may
become dominant in the large tan β region.

discovery contours for SUSY Higgs particles at the ATLAS and CMS experiment, respectively. Referring to the ATLAS experiment [the overall picture is essentially the same for
the CMS experiment, cf. Fig. 3.5], the basic features can be summarized as follows: Taking
into account the exclusion limits set by LEP2 at a c.m. energy of 200 GeV, the light Higgs
state h produced in association with tt¯ may be found in its b¯b decay channel for pseudoscalar
>
Higgs masses MA >
∼ 110 GeV. In the mass range MA ∼ 200 GeV the CP-even Higgs boson h
can be found via the γγ decay channel. The heavy Higgs particles H and A can be found
> 100 GeV and moderate and large values of tan β. Since
in the channel H/A → τ τ for MA ∼
the MSSM Higgs couplings to charged leptons grow with tan β, for larger values tan β >
∼ 10
the search channel H/A → µµ opens in the same MA region. As the masses for the heavy
CP-even and the CP-odd Higgs boson are almost the same in this parameter space it will be
very difficult to disentangle the H signal from the pseudoscalar signal. For MA <
∼ 140 GeV,
the charged Higgs boson produced in top decays can be searched for in the channel t → bH + .

The mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson h is expected be determined with a precision
of 200 MeV at the LHC [9]. However, the final picture exhibits two difficult regions. For
< MA <
90 ∼
∼ 110 GeV, the light Higgs boson might be seen neither by LEP2 nor by LHC. And
>
> 6 up to 15, no heavy neutral Higgs bosons can be discovered
for MA ∼ 200 GeV and tan β ∼
so that the distinction between the SM and the MSSM based solely on light scalar Higgs
measurements will be difficult. Note also that if neutralinos and charginos are light enough,
Higgs decays into these particles are possible and will change the search strategies at the
LHC [34].

By appropriate rescaling of the SM results an analysis for the MSSM Higgs boson search
has been carried out at the Tevatron [33]. The analysed production channels for the scalar
Higgs particles are Higgs-strahlung with subsequent decay into b¯b and associated production
with b¯b for all neutral MSSM Higgs particles. The results for the exclusion regions at 95% CL
and the 5σ discovery regions depend on the chosen set of SUSY parameters. For example,
in the case of maximal mixing a light scalar Higgs with mass <
∼ 130 GeV can be discovered
at the 5σ level in almost the whole MA − tan β plane if an integrated luminosity of 30 fb−1
can be achieved. Difficult regions are the low MA region for moderate and large values of
tan β. A detailed prescription of the analysis can be found in [33, 35].

3.2

Higgs boson search at e+e− colliders

e+ e− linear colliders operating in the c.m. energy range between 500 GeV and 1 TeV are
ideal instruments for the search of Higgs bosons with masses in the intermediate mass range.
In this section the Higgs boson search at these future colliders will be reviewed.

For moderate values of the Higgs mass and in the low energy range Higgs-strahlung is the
main production process [36, 37]. Beyond the threshold region the cross section decreases

proportional s−1 with the maximum being reached rather close to the threshold. For larger
energies W W fusion starts playing a rˆole [38–41] since in the high-energy limit, MH2 /s and
2
/s ≪ 1, the cross section increases with log s. Another production mechanism is provided
MW
by ZZ fusion. Due to the small Ze+ e− couplings this process is suppressed by an order of
magnitude compared to W W fusion. Yet, the Z decay yields two leptons in the final state
so that by reconstructing the recoil mass a sufficiently large signal to background ratio can
be achieved.
In Fig. 3.6 the cross sections
of W W boson fusion and Higgs-strahlung are shown for two
√
typical collider energies, s = 500 GeV and 800 GeV [10]. Apparently, W W fusion is the
dominant process for higher energies. The cross sections are O(1-100) fb yielding up to 105
events in the intermediate mass range for the foreseen integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1 in
the low-energy phase.
Due to the definite energy EZ of the recoiling Z boson in the√Higgs-strahlung process
the Higgs mass can be determined via the relation MH2 = s − 2 sEZ + MZ2 . The Higgs
boson search will be independent from the decay channel and the signal will only slightly be
modified when detector properties are taken into account [42]. Also in W W fusion it will be
no problem to find the Higgs boson since the main background e+ e− → (e+ )νe W − with the
positron in the final state escaping detection is small. The mass of the SM Higgs particle
can be determined at e+ e− colliders very precisely by exploiting the kinematic constraints
in the leptonic channels of Higgs-strahlung events. For an integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1
and a c.m. energy of 350 GeV, a precision of ∼ 150 MeV can be reached for Higgs masses
between 120 and 160
independent of the Higgs decay mode [43]. The discovery limit is

(3.3)

The cross sections for Higgs-strahlung and pair production can be cast into the form
σ(e+ e− → Zh/H) = sin2 / cos2 (β − α)σSM
¯
σ(e+ e− → Ah/H) = cos2 / sin2 (β − α)σSM λ

(3.4)

where σSM denotes the SM cross section for Higgs-strahlung and λ
Aj

near the threshold.
The cross sections for h, H production via Higgs-strahlung and pair production are among
themselves and mutually complementary to each other being proportional either to sin2 (β −
α) or cos2 (β − α). Since σSM is large, at least the light CP-even Higgs boson should be
found: If sin2 (β − α) is small, also MA is small, and h can then be detected in associated
production with a light A.
The upper plot in Fig. 3.7 shows representative examples of the cross sections for the
production of neutral Higgs bosons as a function of the Higgs masses for tan β = 3 and 30.
In the decoupling limit where sin(β − α) → 1 the hZ cross section becomes maximal being
of O(60 fb). In contrast, the HZ cross section is large at the lower end of the mass range.
The signal signature, also for HZ in most of the parameter space, involves a Z boson and
a b¯b or τ + τ − pair. Since the process Ah grows with cos2 (β − α) it increases towards lower
Mh masses where cos(β − α) approaches its maximum absolute value. The complementary
process AH is preferred for large MH . The signature will in both cases include four b quarks
in most of the parameter space so that a good b-tagging performance will be required in order
to separate the signal from the background due to QCD jets and Z boson pair production.
√
For small Higgs masses (below ∼ 160 GeV for s = 500 GeV) W W fusion dominates
over Higgs-strahlung [28]. Yet, it involves neutrinos in the final state thus rendering the
extraction of the signal more difficult. On the other hand the leptonic final states of ZZ
fusion allow for the full signal reconstruction although it is an order of magnitude smaller
than the W W fusion process.
The lower plot in Fig. 3.7 shows the production cross sections for charged Higgs bosons
as a function of the Higgs mass for tan β = 3 and 30. If kinematically allowed they are
produced via top-decays, t → b + H + . For tan β > 1, charged Higgs bosons decay into τ ντ
so that lepton universality will be broken in the final state, since τ states dominate over e, µ
final states in t decays. For large masses MH ± the bosons have to be pair-produced in e+ e−
collisions, e+ e− → H + H − . The cross section which only depends on MH ± decreases fast due
to P -wave suppression ∼ β 3 near the threshold. γγ collisions, however, yield larger cross
sections.
The preceding discussion has shown that the light CP-even Higgs boson will not escape
detection at linear colliders. Its mass may be determined with an accuracy of 50 MeV [46].

M independently of tan β requires a c.m. energy s ∼ 2M [10], hence s ∼ 1.6 TeV for
MA/H = 800 GeV. Since the photons produced from Compton scattered laser light off
energetic electron/positron beams have approximately the same energy as the initial beams
and high luminosity [12], Higgs production in γγ collisions provides an additional powerful
mechanism that can be used for the Higgs boson search.
In this section the heavy MSSM Higgs production via γγ fusion at a high-luminosity e+ e−
linear collider will be analysed. The branching ratios of the A and H decay modes that will
be exploited for this task are illustrated in Fig. 3.8 as a function of the corresponding Higgs

mass in the range 200...800 GeV. The higgsino mixing parameter is chosen µ = 200 GeV,
the universal gaugino mass parameter M2 = 200 GeV and tan β = 7. The SUSY breaking
sfermion masses are chosen as 1 TeV and the SUSY breaking trilinear couplings are set equal
to 0. This will be the SUSY parameter set used in the following if not stated otherwise. In
the lower mass range H and A preferentially decay into b¯b whereas in the upper mass range,
beyond the corresponding kinematic thresholds, the chargino decays dominate followed by
the neutralino channels. Above the tt¯ threshold the branching ratio into top quarks amounts
up to ∼ 13%. At the lower end of the mass range the τ + τ − branching ratio may reach ∼ 10%.
b¯b production
The signal process γγ → Higgs → b¯b is confronted with the background reaction γγ →
b¯b. In order to suppress the background with respect to the signal it is helpful to use
polarized photons. The spin-0 Higgs particles are only produced from an initial state with
the third component of the angular momentum Jz = 0. The Jz = 0 background process,
however, is suppressed by m2b /s in leading order [47–52]. The channel γγ → b¯b hence
provides an outstanding signature for the heavy MSSM Higgs boson search. The signal
process proceeding via massive s-channel Higgs bosons dominantly develops a 2–jet topology
in the final state whereas the next-to-leading order (NLO) background process favours the
3-jet topology due to the leading order (LO) suppression m2b /s for Jz = 0. In the case of
the light b-quarks the subsequent analysis will therefore investigate the two-jet final state.
Next-to-leading order calculations have shown that the m2b /s suppression is removed by
gluon brems-strahlung [48–52]. The significance of the 2-jet signal topology can therefore
be spoiled by the radiatively corrected background process if partons are collinear or one
of the partons is rather soft thus faking a 2-jet final state. This background has to be
suppressed by applying stringent cuts. The two-jet configuration due to soft or collinear
partons involves large double logarithms [49–52]. In order to properly take into account
higher order corrections the logarithms have to be resummed leading to the well-known
Sudakov form factor [53] denoted by Fg which corresponds to the emission of soft real and
the exchange of soft virtual gluons and a non-Sudakov form factor Fq related to soft virtual
quark contributions [51, 52].
The subsequent analysis will investigate heavy MSSM Higgs production in
e+ e− → γγ → A/H → b¯b

(3.5)

for polarized electron/positron and photon beams. The discovery reach in the Higgs mass
range MA/H = 200...800 GeV for moderate tan β = 7 is analysed by including the background
and the interference process in the two-jet topology. Radiative corrections are thoroughly
incorporated considering the QCD corrections to signal [54–59], background [49, 50] and also
to the interference process, calculated in this thesis for the first time. The leading higherorder QCD corrections which are sizeable in the two-jet configuration are considered through
the resummation of the Sudakov and non-Sudakov double logarithms [51, 52].
The tt¯ and τ + τ − channel
As further options Higgs detection in
e+ e− → γγ → A/H → tt¯ and τ + τ −

(3.6)

is investigated. In contrast to the top-quark final state the τ + τ − production does not acquire
final state QCD corrections. The τ + τ − process will be analysed for the two tan β values 7
and 30. Since the Yukawa couplings of A and H to τ + τ − increase with rising tan β, thus

28

CHAPTER 3. HIGGS BOSON SEARCH

enhancing the corresponding branching fractions, the signal cross section will grow with
tan β while the background process is independent of tan β.
Chargino and neutralino production
Since the branching ratios of the chargino and neutralino channels are rather large the
processes
e+ e− → γγ → A/H → χ˜i+ χ˜j− ,
e+ e− → γγ → A/H → χ˜i0 χ˜j0 ,

(i, j = 1, 2)
(i, j = 1, ..., 4; not i = j = 1)

(3.7)

may provide additional interesting detection channels. The SUSY particle pair production
cross sections are summed over all possible final states excluding however the production of
χ˜01 χ
˜01 where χ
˜01 denotes the lightest neutralino. This is due to the assumption that χ˜01 is the
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Because of R-parity conservation it cannot decay
and the χ˜01 χ
˜01 state will escape detection. As in the case of lepton production the SUSY
processes do not involve final state QCD corrections.

3.3.1

The quark final states

1.) Signal process
The signal process γγ → q q¯ proceeds via the MSSM Higgs bosons h, H and A. Fig. 3.9
shows the generic diagrams contributing to the process at LO and at NLO. The two photons
are coupled to the Higgs bosons through triangle loops including heavy charged fermions,
charginos and in the case of CP-even Higgs bosons also W bosons and charged Higgs bosons
as well as sfermions. A does neither couple to gauge bosons at tree level, cf. Tab. 2.1, nor to
charged Higgs particles, cf. Tab. 3.1. Furthermore A flips the sfermion helicity whereas it is
conserved in the coupling to the photon so that sfermion loops do not contribute to the γγA
coupling. The effective γγh/H coupling for incoming photons k1µ , k2ν is given by [60, 61]

the total width. The velocity β is given by β = (1 − 4m2q /s)1/2 . Obviously, since the Higgs
bosons carry spin 0, the Jz = ±2 cross sections vanish.

The generic diagrams contributing to the NLO processes, cf. Fig. 3.9, involve the QCD
corrections to the quark and squark loops in the γγΦ form factor due to virtual gluon exchange. For the t and b loops the QCD corrections are known for finite quark and Higgs
masses [55, 56] whereas for squark loops they have only been calculated in the large squark

The scale µ has been identified with µ = s/2. The running mass is normalized to the pole
mass mq via

The QCD corrections to the Higgs decay into q q¯ involving virtual gluon exchange and real

electroweak and SUSY-QCD corrections are known [62]. Since they are moderate they have
not been implemented. Only the gluino corrections can become large if tan β and the higgsino mixing parameter µ are large [62].

Qq denotes the electric charge of the quark in units of the positron charge and α the electromagnetic coupling. The NLO 2+3-jet cross section is built up by the virtual corrections
involving self-energy contributions, vertex corrections and box diagrams and by the bremsstrahlung processes, cf. Fig. 3.10. The virtual cross sections involve UV and IR divergences.
The UV singularities are absorbed by the renormalization of the quark mass and the γq q¯

in the virtual cross section. The results for polarized photons are given in Refs. [49, 50].

The virtual interference cross section in next-to-leading order is obtained from the interference of the virtual NLO background and the LO signal diagrams and vice versa. The UV and
IR singularities which turn up in the loop integrals are treated in dimensional regularization,
i.e. all cross sections are calculated in n = 4 − 2ǫ space-time dimensions. The matrix γ5 included in the pseudoscalar Higgs-Yukawa coupling has been treated in the ’t Hooft/Veltman

and MLO denotes the Born amplitude, MV the virtual amplitude. The number of photon
spin degrees of freedom in n dimensions is n − 2 so that averaging over the spin leads to
(n − 2)−2 = (1 − ǫ)−2 /4. The mass parameter µ has been introduced because the coupling
constant is not dimensionless any more in n dimensions. The spacial angle constant
Sǫ = (4π)−2+ǫ and the remaining factors result from the calculation of the n-dimensional
2-particle phase space. Since only the initial photon state Jz = 0 couples to the Higgs boson
the polarized interference cross sections for Jz = ±2 are zero. Due to CP-invariance the
polarized Jz = 0 interference cross section is thus given by the unpolarized result:
σI++ = σI−− = 2σIunpol

(3.25)

It is therefore sufficient to calculate the unpolarized interference cross section in order to
get the polarized result. The virtual loop integrals are reduced to scalar integrals by means
of the reduction procedure outlined in Ref. [64]. The scalar integrals are listed in the Appendix. The virtual corrections encounter poles ǫ−1 due to UV and IR singularities but no
collinear divergences since the quarks are massive. The UV divergences are absorbed by the
renormalization of the quark mass, the quark wave function, the Yukawa coupling and the
quark-photon coupling. The renormalization conditions for the quark self-energy Σ(p) in the

The pseudoscalar Higgs-Yukawa coupling includes the matrix γ5 . The ’t Hooft/Veltman

The differential three particle phase space dP S3 (P ≡ k1 + k2 ; p1 , p2 , k) which turns up in
the calculation of the 2 → 3 process (3.32) can be decomposed into two two-particle phase
spaces:
dP S3(P ; p1 , p2 , k) =

dQ2
dP S2(P ; k, Q)dP S2(Q; p1 , p2 )
2π

(3.36)

The two differential phase space factors dP S2 correspond to the processes where the two
photons with total momentum P decay into the gluon and an intermediate state X with
momentum Q which subsequently decays into the quark anti-quark pair. The invariant mass
of the state X is given by Q2 = zs (4m2q /s < z < 1). The upper limit of z corresponds to
the IR region where the gluon momentum k approaches 0. The lower limit is given by the

34

CHAPTER 3. HIGGS BOSON SEARCH

fact that the invariant mass of X must be large enough to produce two quarks.
In the calculation of σE the decomposition (3.36) allows to factorize the soft gluon kinematics from the remaining kinematics which become equal to the kinematics of the Born
process γγ → q q¯ in the IR region. Since the singularities originate only from the soft gluon
momentum, the variable z is set equal to 1 in the quark momenta in the IR limit so that
the quark velocity is given by β = (1 − 4m2q /s)1/2 . The differential Eikonal cross section can
then be written as

is calculated numerically in 4 dimensions, i.e. ǫ = 0. The momenta in the interference
matrix element MI are parameterized according to the three jet kinematics where z = 1. In
contrast, in the singular matrix element Msing , calculated from Eq. (3.35), only the gluon
momentum is given in the three jet kinematics and the quark momenta are parameterized
in the Born kinematics since they have to be treated in the same way as in the integration
of dσE .
Adding the O(αs ) virtual and brems-strahlung contributions provides the NLO interference cross section. The total interference cross section without cuts is also given by the
imaginary part of the Higgs-γγ form factor via the optical theorem. Since the form factor
at NLO can be extracted from the literature [55, 56] it serves as a quantitative cross check
for the obtained result.
4.) Two-jet final state
For reasons outlined above the photons will be taken polarized and the bottom-quark production will be analysed in the two-jet final state topology. A final state will be regarded as
two-jet event if the gluon energy Eg is less than a minimal gluon energy Egmin or if two of
the three jets are collinear. In this analysis Egmin will be chosen as
√
(3.49)
Egmin = 0.1 sγγ
√
where sγγ denotes the c.m. energy in the γγ fusion process. Two jets will be combined to
a single jet if the angle α between them is less than
αmin = 10◦

(3.50)

The 2-jet result can be obtained from the NLO result and the 3-jet cross section σ3j (γγ →
b¯b + g) which has been calculated for polarized photons in the signal, background and interference process. The two-jet cross section is then given by

For signal (S), background (B) and interference (I) process, respectively, the resummation
form factor F reads
FS = Fg
FB = Fg Fq2
FI = Fg Fq

(3.53)

Fg denotes the Sudakov resummation factor and Fq the non-Sudakov factor. The dynamical
origin of the signal, background and interference form factors is explained in detail in [51].
A brief understanding at O(αs ) shall be given here. At NLO the Sudakov and non-Sudakov
double logarithms in the Jz = 0 state arise in four non-overlapping kinematic regions. They
are depicted in Fig. 3.11. One is related to the emission of a soft real gluon and the exchange
of a soft virtual gluon that connects two helicity conserving vertices. This configuration
[diagram (a) in Fig. 3.11] occurs both in the signal and background process. The soft gluon
contribution can be factorized from the Born amplitude resulting in the NLO term of the
expansion of Fg . For the background there are three more kinematic regimes [diagrams
(b)–(d) in Fig. 3.11]. They involve a soft virtual quark connecting a helicity conserving and a
helicity violating vertex. Factorizing these contributions from the Born amplitude one is left
with the NLO term in the expansion of the non-Sudakov form factor Fq . Since the Sudakov
and non-Sudakov factors factorize at the amplitude level,
MSresum =

Mresum

(3.54)

the results of Eq. (3.53) are obtained.
The form factors Fg and Fq , including the leading and next-to-leading order running
coupling αs , are taken from [52]. The cross section for b¯b production with initial state
helicity Jz in the 2-jet topology including resummation then reads

definition (3.56) takes into account that the LO cross section and the full next-to-leading

The cut lc was introduced in the calculation of the resummation factors in order to separate
soft gluons from hard gluons. In the soft gluon region the Eikonal-approximation, exploited
in the calculation of the resummation factors, is valid. The cut lc ≤ Egmin further subdivides
the 2-jet region that is characterized by gluons with energies less than Egmin . The dependence
on this phase space slicing parameter cancels at one-loop level since the full NLO calculation
is included. As suggested as best guess in Ref. [65] the cut lc will be chosen
equal to Egmin

in the following. The strong coupling constant αs is taken at the scale s.

3.3.2

The τ + τ − channel

For the LO process γγ → τ + τ − the signal, background and interference cross section can
be extracted from the corresponding LO quark cross sections (3.15),(3.20) and (3.22) by
replacing the Yukawa coupling in the Higgs decay appropriately, the quark mass and charge
with the analogous τ lepton values and setting the colour factor Nc = 1. At NLO there are
no QCD corrections in the final state but only in the γγΦ form factor.

3.3.3

Chargino and neutralino production

Likewise the τ + τ − channel the chargino and neutralino production does not involve final
state QCD corrections. Due to the different masses in the final state the expression for
chargino production via intermediate Higgs states is more cumbersome than in the case of
quark anti-quark production. With the Higgs to chargino couplings listed in Table 3.1 and
with the same notation as in subsection 3.3.1 the chargino χ˜i+ χ˜−

The interference between the scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs channel is proportional to the
minus (plus) sign for σ ++ (σ −− ). µi,j denote the scaled chargino masses Mχ˜2i,j /s and βij the
velocity for non-degenerate chargino final states. The signal cross sections for Jz = ±2 are
zero. The LO cross section for the background process γγ → χ˜i+ χ˜−

the corresponding quark process Eq. (3.20) by replacing the quark mass (charge) with the
chargino mass (charge) and setting Nc = 1. After cos θ has been integrated out in the range

The minus (plus) sign in the contributions proportional to (GΦ − GΦ∗ ) (Φ = h, H, A) corresponds to σ ++ (σ −− ). Assuming CP-invariance, the couplings gΦχ˜i χ˜j are real and orthogonal
so that the formulae (3.59) and (3.60) adopt a much simpler form.
In the neutralino channel there are no background and interference contributions at LO.
The neutralino signal cross section is given by the chargino result (3.59) after replacing the
masses appropriately and the chargino couplings gΦχ˜i χ˜j with the neutralino couplings gΦχ˜0i χ˜j0 ,
cf. Table 3.1. For equal neutralinos in the final state Bose symmetry requires an additional
factor 1/2.

is obtained by folding the cross section of the subprocess γγ → X1 X2 denoted by σ

the γγ luminosity. The γγ luminosity for Compton scattered photons off (polarized) electron/positron beams has been calculated [66]. It has been given as a function of the photon
energy, of the initial electron/positron and laser polarization as well as of the final state
photon helicities.
The differential photon luminosity Lγγ is maximal and peaked towards high energies if
the electron/positron and laser beams are polarized and have opposite helicity. The electron/positron helicities Pe± will therefore be chosen equal to 1 in the following and the

particularly since [dL++ +L−− ]/dz drops rapidly around the maximum, cf. Fig. 3.12. Furthermore, the signal process is folded with the maximum√luminosity for a given electron/positron
c.m. energy. The integration interval (2 × 5) GeV/ see accounts for the limited energy resolution of about 10 GeV which may be achieved at a high-luminosity e+ e− linear collider.
The interference cross section here and in the following plots is not shown separately since
it is fairly small in this specific numerical example, only of O(10−3 fb). The heavy CP-even
Higgs mass MH and MA differ by at most ∼ 2.5 GeV for the chosen SUSY parameter set.
The interference cross section, which is proportional to the real part of the MSSM Higgs
propagators, is therefore almost vanishing since A and H are produced nearly on-shell and
the contribution of the light scalar Higgs is very much suppressed as it is far off-shell.
The SUSY parameters are chosen as µ = M2 = 200 GeV, tan β = 7, common sfermion
mass MS = 1 TeV and the SUSY breaking trilinear couplings are set equal to 0. The NLO
corrections and leading higher order contributions have been included in the way outlined
above. The O(αs ) real and virtual corrections to the signal part amount up to ∼ 20%
compared to the LO cross section. The NLO background cross section is about a factor
10 to 60 larger than the LO result in the considered mass range because at next-to-leading
order the Jz = 0 background suppression by m2b /s is removed and becomes of O(1). In the

CHAPTER 3. HIGGS BOSON SEARCH

41

case of the interference part the NLO corrections are large.
The background contribution can be reduced enormously by cutting away the 3-jet events.
With the chosen cuts defining the 2-jet topology the background is suppressed by 2 orders of
magnitude compared to the complete 3-jet NLO cross section. The reason is that the 2-jet
NLO cross section is dominated by the helicity-flipped Jz = 0 states which are suppressed.
[It is the non helicity-flipped Jz = 0 states which remove the m2b /s suppression at NLO.] In
contrast the signal is reduced by ∼ 40% while the interference part is reduced by an order
of magnitude.
The background can further be suppressed by cutting the integration region in cos θ where
θ denotes the angle between the b-quark and the beam axis. The integration range has been
chosen [−0.5, 0.5] in Fig. 3.13. More than 90% of the background proceeding via t- and
u-channel diagrams is cut away whereas the isotropic signal is reduced by a factor 1/2 only.
In the 2-jet topology the resummation turns out to be important. It increases the 2-jet
signal by up to ∼ 30% and changes the interference 2-jet cross section by O(100%). For
the background reaction the impact is even larger. At the upper mass range of MA it is the
main contribution to the complete 2-jet background result.
The signal process shows a rich structure. The two peaks at MA ≈ 280 and 540 GeV
are due to the behaviour of the γγA form factor which peaks when the chargino thresholds
χ
˜+
˜1− and χ
˜2+ χ˜−
1χ
2 are reached. The masses of the charginos for the chosen parameter set are
Mχ˜1± = 141 GeV ,

Mχ˜2± = 270 GeV

(3.65)

The kink around 410 GeV can be understood from the H → b¯b branching fraction, c.f. Fig. 3.8.
It drops when the χ˜+
˜−
1χ
2 channel opens. The peak at ∼ 350 GeV, finally, is a mixture of the
behaviour of the branching fraction and γγA form factor at the tt¯ threshold.
As can be inferred from Fig. 3.13 the resummed 2-jet signal cross section amounts up to
a few fb whereas the background is less than 0.5 fb. By focusing on the 2-jet final states
and cutting the integration
range in cos θ the signal to background ratio can be enhanced
√
to significances S/ B above 5 in the whole MA range 200...800 GeV for an integrated
luminosity of L = 100 fb−1 in three years. Demanding the total cross section to exceed
1 fb γγ fusion allows to find the pseudoscalar and scalar Higgs bosons for masses less than
about 400 GeV. Higgs production via Compton back-scattered photons therefore provides a
powerful mechanism for the heavy MSSM Higgs boson search in the b¯b channel.
tt¯ and τ + τ − final states
Fig. 3.14 illustrates the results for the tt¯ and τ + τ − final states at next-to-leading order. If not
stated otherwise the SUSY parameters and the smearing procedure with the γγ luminosity
are the same as in the b¯b case in the following.
For tt¯ the (2+3)-jet NLO cross section has been plotted. Since the electric top-quark
charge is 2/3 and enters in the fourth power in the background process, the background is
rather large. Furthermore, the 2-jet topology is not suppressed very much because of the
large top-quark mass. Therefore the restriction on the 2-jet final state is not efficient. Also
due to the large top mass the cut in cos θ does not lead to a significant enhancement in
the signal to background ratio though it may be improved if the cut is chosen equal to 0.7.
Nevertheless, the significance does not achieve the 5σ level.
Below the tt¯ threshold the complete τ + τ − production cross section amounts up to O(10 fb).
The τ ± charge is unity so that the background is large. Since the τ mass is rather small

a cut in cos θ is worthwhile. The best signal to background ratio can be achieved for the
integration region | cos θ| < 0.7. Nevertheless for moderate values of tan β = 7 the signal is
too small compared to the background cross section to reach significances above 5. The situation changes for larger values of tan β since the branching fraction of A → τ + τ − increases
with tan β as can be inferred from Fig. 3.8. The signal cross section is therefore larger for
tan β = 30 whereas the background cross section remains the same so that in the mass range
MA ≈ 300...480 GeV significances exceeding 5 with τ + τ − production cross sections larger
than 1 fb can be achieved.
In contrast to the τ + τ − channel, increasing the value of tan β will not enhance the signal
to background ratio in tt¯ production since the A Yukawa coupling to the top quarks is
proportional to cot β so that the tt¯ signal cross section decreases with rising tan β.
The peaks and kinks in the tt¯ and τ + τ − signal cross sections can readily be explained by
the behaviour of the H and A branching fractions in these channels and the γγA form factor
when the various chargino and the tt¯ production thresholds are reached. For tan β = 30 the
chargino masses are
Mχ˜±1 = 149 GeV ,

Mχ˜2± = 266 GeV

Fig. 3.15 presents the NLO cross sections for chargino and neutralino production as a function

Mχ˜01 = 85 GeV
Mχ˜03 = 208 GeV

Mχ˜02 = 148 GeV
Mχ˜04 = 271 GeV

(3.67)

Since the chargino and neutralino masses are rather large a cut in θ does not improve the

Above MA ≈ 230 GeV, the threshold for the χ˜01 χ

to neutralinos. The kinks and peaks in the signal curve correspond to the various chargino

CHAPTER 3. HIGGS BOSON SEARCH

Due to the escaping LSPs and neutrinos the final states in the chargino and neutralino
cascade decays are rather similar. Since the chargino background is very large it will be
challenging to separate the neutralino signal from the chargino background. Exploiting the
different decay topologies, however, the neutralino channel may serve for the heavy MSSM
Higgs boson search also in the mass range above the chargino production threshold.

3.3.5

Discovery reach

The c.m. energy in all production channels has been integrated in a narrow energy range
around MA . Since the mass of the heavy scalar Higgs H differs hardly from MA it is also
produced almost on-shell. Though it will be very difficult if not impossible to separate
the pseudoscalar and scalar heavy Higgs particle, the detection of additional heavy Higgs
particles will help to disentangle the MSSM from the SM if only one light Higgs boson has
been discovered at the LHC as it might be the case in the parameter region MA >
∼ 200 GeV
and tan β >
6
up
to
15.
∼
The analysis has demonstrated that heavy MSSM Higgs production in polarized γγ fusion
at a Compton collider provides an excellent mechanism to detect the pseudoscalar and scalar
Higgs bosons in the b¯b channel for moderate values of tan β. By this way the discovery region
which is not covered by the LHC can be closed. In addition, the mass range up to which
√
the Higgs bosons can be detected in γγ fusion extends up to ∼ 0.8 see in contrast to e+ e−
√
collisions with a discovery range of ∼ 0.5 see . For the detection in the b¯b channel it is
crucial, however, to investigate 2-jet final states. Including NLO and resummation of higher
orders the analysis has been completed to the currently most accurate level.
While the tt¯ mode is not promising, an additional channel is provided by τ + τ − production
for large values of tan β. The neutralino channel, finally, can be exploited in mass regions
below the chargino threshold, if it is kinematically allowed, where it is not plagued by the
large chargino background. Above the threshold the different topologies of the final states
may help to extract the neutralino signal from the chargino background.

Chapter 4
The Lifetime of Higgs particles
The two basic properties characterizing particles are the mass and the lifetime. As outlined
in the previous chapter the masses of the SM and MSSM Higgs particles can be determined
with high accuracy at the LHC and high-energy e+ e− linear colliders. The determination of
the lifetimes, i.e. the total widths of the Higgs bosons is a more difficult task, especially for
Higgs states with narrow widths.
Starting with a theoretical overview over the total widths and the main decay channels
of the SM Higgs boson and the MSSM Higgs scalars, several mechanisms will be presented,
subsequently, which can be exploited at e+ e− linear colliders in order to determine the SM
Higgs lifetime for masses in the intermediate range where it is narrow. The MSSM case will
be discussed qualitatively.

4.1

The SM Higgs boson decays

The Higgs couplings to the W , Z gauge bosons and to the fermions are proportional to
the masses of these particles, cf. Eqs. (2.10), (2.14). Consequently, the Higgs boson will
predominantly decay into the heaviest particles of the SM, i.e. W , Z gauge bosons, top and
bottom quark, if this is kinematically allowed.
The Higgs couplings to γγ, γZ and gg are mediated by heavy particle loops. The Higgs
decays into these particles only play a rˆole for Higgs masses below ∼ 140 GeV, where the
total Higgs decay width is rather small. They are interesting since they are sensitive to
scales far beyond the Higgs mass and thus to new particles whose masses are generated by
the Higgs mechanism.
The main contributions to the Hγγ coupling come from top-quark and W boson loops.
In the intermediate mass range, MW ≤ MH ≤ 2MZ , the W -loop contribution dominates
and interferes destructively with the fermion amplitude. The same holds true for the HγZ
coupling. The Higgs coupling to gluons is practically almost built up by top-quark loops
and the branching ratio is only sizeable below the W W threshold.
The decay modes discussed in the following are generated with the FORTRAN program
HDECAY [67]. They include electroweak [68] and QCD corrections [58, 59]. Also the decay
into off-shell particles below the threshold is taken into account [69–71].
In Fig. 4.1 the total decay width and the branching ratios of the SM Higgs particle are
shown as a function of the Higgs mass. Below about 140 GeV the total width is less than

ratio of about 85%. The next important decay channels are provided by the decays into
τ + τ − , charm-quarks and gluons. Beyond ∼ 140 GeV the decay into W bosons becomes
dominant followed by the ZZ decay mode. Above MH = 2mt the decay into top quarks
is kinematically possible. The branching ratio, however, always remains below 20% since
the decay width is proportional to the Higgs mass whereas the leading W W and ZZ decay
widths grow with the third power of the Higgs mass. Thus the total width strongly increases
with the Higgs mass, up to 600 GeV for MH = 1 TeV.

Decay modes of the MSSM Higgs particles
The total decay widths and branching ratios of non-SUSY
decays

The MSSM Higgs bosons mainly decay into heavy quarks and gauge bosons if kinematically
allowed. This is due to the fact that the corresponding couplings are proportional to the
masses of the particles which are generated by the Higgs mechanism. In contrast to the SM,
however, the decay into bottom quarks becomes dominant for large tan β since the couplings
are enhanced in this case, c.f. Table 2.1. Furthermore, the couplings to W and Z bosons are
suppressed by cos(β −α) or sin(β −α) compared to the SM couplings. The decay widths and
branching ratios discussed below have been obtained by means of the FORTRAN program
HDECAY [67]. The Higgs sector contains the radiative corrections due to top/bottom and
squark loops calculated in the effective potential approach, and the NLO QCD corrections
as well as the mixing in the stop and sbottom sectors are included [21]. Off-shell decays into
vector gauge bosons and top-quarks below the threshold have also been taken into account
[70, 71].
The leading order widths of h, H into gluons are mediated by quark and squark loops
which are important for squark masses below about 400 GeV [72]. In contrast to the SM, the
bottom quark contribution can become important for large values of tan β where the relevant
coupling is strongly enhanced. The pseudoscalar A decay into gluons only involves quark
loops and no squark loops since A flips the helicity of the squarks whereas the gluon coupling
to squarks conserves the squark-helicity. The decays of the CP-even neutral Higgs particles
h, H into photons are generated by heavy charged fermion, W boson, charged Higgs boson,
chargino and sfermion loops whereas the corresponding A decay is mediated by fermion and
chargino loops only.
The heavy scalar particle H can also decay into a pair of light Higgs bosons or a pair of
pseudoscalar bosons if kinematically allowed. The radiatively corrected Higgs self-couplings
in the one-loop leading m4t approximation are given by Eq. (2.49). Moreover, the heavy
Higgs particles can decay into a gauge and a Higgs boson.
Figs. 4.2 and 4.3 show the total decay widths of the MSSM Higgs particles and the neutral
Higgs boson branching ratios into non-SUSY particles as a function of the corresponding
Higgs mass for two values of tan β = 3, 50. As can be inferred from Fig. 4.3 the light scalar
Higgs boson dominantly decays into bottom quarks, independent of tan β, with a branching
ratio up to about 90%. The remaining 10% are almost solely supplemented by the decay
into τ ’s. At the maximum value of the light Higgs mass, i.e. in the decoupling limit, the
branching ratios approach the SM values.
For large tan β the dominant decay mode of the heavy scalar Higgs boson is the decay
into bottom quarks (90%), followed by the decay into τ + τ − which amounts up to about
10%. For small values of tan β, H preferentially decays into a pair of light Higgs bosons
when kinematically allowed. Otherwise the b decay takes over the dominant rˆole below the
tt¯ threshold. The next important channels are provided by the decays into W and Z bosons,
respectively. Beyond the tt¯ threshold the decay into top quarks is by far dominant.
For large values of tan β the branching ratios of the pseudoscalar Higgs show the same
pattern as those for H. For small tan β values the bottom decay only dominates below the

have to be taken into account. Their branching ratios may yield 100% below the various
top-quark thresholds so that the Higgs boson search at the LHC becomes difficult because
some of these decays develop invisible signatures [45].
The Higgs decays into sfermions of the first two generations are not important. If decays
into sfermions of the third generation are kinematically allowed they can become sizeable,
however, and reach branching ratios of up to 80%.

CHAPTER 4. THE LIFETIME OF HIGGS PARTICLES

4.3

Determination of the lifetime of Higgs bosons

The lifetime of the Higgs bosons can be determined by exploiting the relation
Γtot = Γi /BRi

(4.1)

where Γi denotes the partial width of the decay H → final state i and BRi the corresponding
branching ratio. For this task several measurements have to be combined. The branching
ratio BRi is determined by measuring both the exclusive process into the final state i and
the inclusive Higgs rate in the same production channel X → H:
incl
σX→H
∼ ΓH→X
excl
σX→i ∼ ΓH→X BRi

(4.2)

Considering all possible production channels at e+ e− colliders the Higgs-strahlung process
e+ e− → ZH is the only channel being suitable for an inclusive measurement. The Higgs
scalar is detected by analysing the recoil spectrum of the Z boson decay products that are
visible. In the case of the MSSM also the associated production channels Ah and AH have
to be taken into account.
The partial decay width Γi is extracted from the inverse process i → H or in associated
production where the Higgs particle is radiated off particle i. The Higgs boson can either
decay into the same state i or another state j. In the latter case the branching ratio BRj
has also to be determined in the Higgs-strahlung process.
σi→H→i ∼ Γi BRi
or σi→H→j ∼ Γi BRj

(4.3)

If either the initial or the final state i are not on-shell the corresponding Higgs form factor
will be probed at different scales in production and decay, respectively, thus allowing new
physics to enter in the determination of the total width. These new effects are associated
with a scale Λ at which they become sizeable. If the scales q 2 at which the Higgs form factor
is probed are small compared to Λ2 , the error due to new physics in the extraction of Γtot is
O(q 2 /Λ2).
In the following the mechanisms which can be exploited at high-energy e+ e− colliders for
the measurement of Γtot both in the SM and the MSSM in the intermediate mass range will
be discussed from a theoretical point of view and some illustrative numbers will be given
[73]. The analysis will be model-independent up to the error originating from the scale
dependence of the Higgs couplings.

4.3.1

The total width of the SM Higgs boson

In the intermediate mass range the relevant channels for the extraction of the total width
are given by i = γγ, W W and ZZ. While the γ’s are on-shell, the W and Z bosons
can be off-shell. Demanding the γγ branching ratio BRγγ to be bigger than 10−3 and
BRW W , BRZZ > 10−2, the γγ channel can be used for MH <
∼ 155 GeV, the ZZ channel for
MH >
110
GeV
and
the
W
W
channel
in
the
whole
intermediate
range, cf. Fig. 4.1. For
∼
high-luminosity linear colliders this corresponds to an event rate O(10)...O(102 ) for γγ and
W W/ZZ final states, respectively:
√
s = 350 GeV
Mh = 100...200 GeV : σ(ZH) = 150...70 fb and L = 500 fb−1

CHAPTER 4. THE LIFETIME OF HIGGS PARTICLES

51

a) γγ channel
From a theoretical point of view the γγ channel provides the cleanest method for the determination of Γtot since the photons are on-shell both in the production and the decay channel.
The γγ fusion Higgs production with the γ’s resulting from the Compton scattering of laser
light can be used to extract the Higgs decay width into γγ:
σ(γγ → H) = 8π 2

Γ(H → γγ) dLγγ
MH
dsγγ

(4.4)

√
dLγγ /dsγγ denotes the γγ luminosity at sγγ = MH . The cross section and hence the partial
width can be determined with an accuracy of about 2% [74]. The on-shell γ’s ensure the
model-independence of the analysis.
Yet, the measurement of the branching ratio BRγγ in the Higgs-strahlung channel
e+ e− → ZH → Z + γγ

(4.5)

is affected by a huge background rendering the error in BRγγ as big as about 15% for
< 130 GeV [75]. This error translates into the maximum accuracy with which Γtot can
MH ∼
be determined in the γγ channel.
b) W W channel
The W W channel is a valuable alternative to the γγ mode [76]. The branching ratio into
W bosons, with one W being virtual, in the lower intermediate Higgs mass range can be
determined with an error of O(5%) down to Higgs masses MH ≈ 120 GeV [76, 77] in the
exclusive process
σZH→ZW W ≡ σ(e+ e− → ZH → ZW W ) ∼ ΓZZ BRW W

(4.6)

[In the following the W and Z bosons may be understood as virtual where appropriate.] The
partial width in turn can be extracted from the W W fusion process e+ e− → ν¯e νe H [39–41]
with
σ(e+ e− → ν¯e νe H) =

(4.7)

∆W parameterizes the non-zero mass effects for H and W in the intermediate mass range.
2
In the limit MW
≪ MH2 ≪ s it approaches zero, ∆W → 0.

The W bosons in the fusion process are off-shell with a maximum virtuality of ∼ MW /2.
Hence, the model dependence introduced by anomalous HW W couplings is negligible compared to the experimental errors if this effect is associated with high scales Λ = 1 TeV.
The H bosons produced in W W fusion can be best detected in the b¯b decay channel
σW W →b¯b ≡ σ(W W → H → b¯b) ∼ ΓW W BRb¯b

(4.8)

Therefore in order to extract the partial width ΓW W the branching ratio BR(H → b¯b) has
to be measured, too. This can be done in the exclusive process
σZH→Zb¯b ≡ σ(e+ e− → ZH → Zb¯b) ∼ ΓZZ BRb¯b

(4.9)

Together with the inclusive process
σZH ≡ σ(e+ e− → ZH) ∼ ΓZZ

For example, for MH = 120 GeV ( s = 350 GeV, L = 500 fb−1 ) the errors in the various
cross sections are: (δσ/σ)W W →b¯b ≈ 2.6% [78], (δσ/σ)ZH→Zb¯b ≈ 2.4% [76] and (δσ/σ)ZH ≈
2.1% [76]. The error in Γtot is therefore dominated by the error in BRW W being O(5%).
This results in δΓtot /Γtot ≈ 7.4%.

With rising Higgs mass the uncertainty in the determination of BRb¯b increases since
the branching ratio decreases and thus renders its measurement more difficult. For MH =
140 GeV an error in Γtot less than 10% [76, 78, 79] still seems feasible whereas for MH near
and above the H → W W threshold the b¯b channel is not useful any more.

Instead the decay H → W W can be exploited in this mass range. The Higgs mass has
to be reconstructed from the four-jet final state resulting from the decay of the W bosons.
In addition, for Higgs masses where the decay H → ZZ is not negligible, the ZZ and
W W modes
their invariant 2-jet-masses. For MH =
√ have to be separated by reconstructing
−1
160 GeV ( s = 350 GeV, L = 500 fb ) the cross section e+ e− → W W → H → W W
can be measured with an error of about 3.1% if an efficiency of ∼ 30% for the detection of
the W W mode is assumed. Hence, with (δσ/σ)ZH→ZW W =3.5% [77] and (δσ/σ)ZH =2.8%
[77] the error in Γtot will be 9.5%.
c) ZZ channel
Provided the Higgs mass is large enough the ZZ channel can be exploited for the measurement of the Higgs lifetime. The partial width Γ(H → ZZ) is accessible in the Higgs-strahlung
process [37]

where ∆Z accounts for the non-zero intermediate Higgs and Z boson mass effects and ∆Z → 0
for MZ2 ≪ MH2 ≪ s. One of the Z bosons is virtual. The HZZ coupling is measured at
the scale q 2 = s in this process whereas the exclusive process e+ e− → ZH → Z + ZZ
which provides the branching
ratio BR(H → ZZ) probes the HZZ coupling at the scale
√
q 2 = MZ2 . Hence, for s = 500 GeV and Λ = 1 TeV the error due to anomalous effects in
the HZZ coupling may be ∼ 25%. By measuring
the Higgs-strahlung process at different
√
c.m. energies and extrapolating down to s = MZ , the uncertainty due to new physics
effects can be reduced to O(MZ2 /Λ2 ). The ZZ fusion process e+ e− → ZZ → H, though an
order of magnitude smaller than the W W fusion process, may serve as a cross-check. With
a Z boson virtuality of ∼ MZ /2 the error accounting for anomalous HZZ couplings is less
than in Higgs-strahlung.
σ(e+ e− → ZH) =

For the detection of the process HZ → ZZZ most of the Z decay channels can be
used since the final state does not encounter any extra neutrinos. Furthermore the ZZZ
continuum background is small so that the error in the determination of the cross section is
essentially given by the total rate in this channel.

4.3.2

Total widths of the MSSM Higgs particles

Since the MSSM contains a quintet of Higgs bosons the extraction of the lifetime of each
Higgs scalar is more involved than in the SM. In order to illustrate the strategy to be

CHAPTER 4. THE LIFETIME OF HIGGS PARTICLES

53

followed the lifetime of the light CP-even Higgs boson h will be discussed. The discussion
may be understood as synopsis of the qualitative features concerning the determination of
the lifetime. In order to make quantitative statements, a detailed experimental analysis has
to be performed.
Fig. 4.3 shows the dominant branching ratios of h for tan β = 3 and 50 (decays into SUSY
particles are not included). Outside the decoupling region the gauge boson channels play
a minor rˆole whereas the b¯b channel is dominating in the whole parameter range followed
by the τ + τ − channel. Especially for large tan β values the Yukawa coupling hbb ∼ mb tan β
is strongly enhanced resulting in a total h width much larger than in the SM for the same
Higgs mass.
a) Gauge boson channels
For the reasons described above the gauge boson channels are less useful for the h width
measurement over most of the parameter range. Only in the decoupling limit they approach
the SM values and the same methods as in the SM can be applied by properly taking into
account the changes in the couplings due to mixing effects in the Higgs sector.
b) b¯b channel
The branching ratio BR(h → b¯b) required for the Γtot determination in the b¯b channel can
be extracted by comparing the inclusive process e+ e− → Zh with the exclusive process
e+ e− → Zh → Zb¯b. The measurement of the partial width Γ(h → b¯b) or equivalently the
coupling hb¯b in the process e+ e− → hb¯b [80–82] is much more involved. The Higgs-radiation
cross section e+ e− → hb¯b is small over a large part of the MSSM parameter range including
the decoupling region. Being proportional to tan2 β it only becomes accessible for large
values of tan β.
The diagrams contributing to the processes e+ e− → hb¯b and e+ e− → H/Ab¯b are shown
in Fig. 4.4. Since the associated production of h with b¯b also includes the coupling Ab¯b,
the determination of the required Yukawa coupling is more complicated than in the SM.
Yet, each coupling Φb¯b (Φ = h, H, A) can be extracted by solving the equation system for
all three processes. Assuming polarized electron/positron beams and the knowledge of the
couplings gZZh/H and gZAh/H the cross sections for the processes e+ e− → Hi b¯b read
σhb¯b = |ghb¯b A1 + gAb¯b A2 + A3 |2
σHb¯b = |gHb¯b A′1 + gAb¯b A′2 + A′3 |2
σAb¯b = |ghb¯b A′′1 + gHb¯b A′′2 + gAb¯b A′′3 |2

(4.13)

where Ai , A′i , A′′i (i = 1, 2, 3) denote the helicity amplitudes of the corresponding subprocesses. Up to discrete ambiguities this system is in principle solvable for all b¯b Higgs Yukawa
couplings.
As is evident from the previous discussion and Fig. 4.4 the final state b¯bb¯b includes several resonant channels. By applying experimental cuts the various resonances have to be
separated so that the contribution due to b → bh can be extracted. The Yukawa coupling
hb¯b e.g. could be determined in the region where one of the possible b-pairings forms a resonance at the h mass and the invariant mass of the remaining b-pair does not reconstruct
the pseudoscalar mass MA . In the decoupling limit h behaves like a SM boson and is not
affected by heavy Higgs boson resonances.
c) τ + τ − channel
Since the τ + τ − Higgs Yukawa coupling is proportional mτ tan β this channel can be exploited

for large tan β, too. On the one hand no ambiguity in pairing the b-jets arises here. On the
other hand the neutrino in the τ decay requires the reconstruction of the invariant τ + τ −
mass, which is necessary for the separation of the A resonance, from the mass recoiling
against the b¯b pair.

Chapter 5
SM and MSSM Higgs self-couplings
In the preceding chapters the discovery of Higgs particles in the SM and the MSSM, the
determination of their masses and lifetimes and the Higgs couplings to gauge and matter
particles have been described in detail. In order to complete the profile of the Higgs bosons,
the Higgs self-couplings have to be probed. This step is essential for the clarification of the
nature of the mechanism that creates particle masses in the SM and its supersymmetric
extensions. Only the knowledge of the Higgs self-couplings will allow for the reconstruction
of the Higgs potential so that the Higgs mechanism can be established experimentally.
In this chapter various double and triple Higgs production mechanisms in the SM and
the MSSM will be analysed [83]. [The relation to general 2-Higgs doublet models has been
discussed in Ref. [84].] At hadron colliders and high-energy e+ e− linear colliders Higgs pair
production via double Higgs-strahlung off W or Z bosons [85–87] and through W W or
ZZ fusion [87–94] allows direct access to the trilinear Higgs self-couplings. In addition at pp
colliders gluon-gluon fusion [61],[94–97] can be exploited, and at photon colliders high-energy
γγ fusion [87, 88, 98] is sensitive to λHHH . For the MSSM case all possible neutral multiHiggs final states as defined in Ref. [23] will be taken into account and thus a theoretically
complete picture for testing the trilinear Higgs self-couplings will be elaborated. By including
new results from parton level background analyses [99–101] and detector simulations [100–
102] the potential of measuring the trilinear Higgs self-couplings at e+ e− linear colliders
and at LHC, respectively, will be discussed. A short remark will be made on the present
expectations of determining the quadrilinear Higgs self-coupling(s). The first section will be
dedicated to the linear collider, first examining the SM case before turning on to the MSSM.
The second section will focus on the LHC.

5.1

Higgs self-couplings at e+e− linear colliders

The two main processes at e+ e− linear colliders which are sensitive to λHHH are double
Higgs-strahlung and W W double-Higgs fusion:

in the Standard Model at e+ e− linear colliders: double Higgs-strahlung and W W fusion.

Fig. 5.1 shows the generic diagrams which contribute to the two processes. Their cross
sections are small, of the order of a few fb and below, for Higgs masses in the intermediate
range so that high-luminosities as expected at e+ e− linear colliders are needed in order to
produce sufficiently high signal rates and to separate the signal from the background.
In the minimal supersymmetric extension there are five physical Higgs states as outlined in
Chapter 2. This leads to six CP-invariant trilinear Higgs couplings among the neutral Higgs
bosons. The couplings including radiative corrections in the one-loop leading m4t approximation are given in Eq. (2.49). In the following analysis the dominant one-loop and the leading
two-loop corrections to the masses and couplings have been included, cf. [21, 103]. The upper bound of the light Higgs mass strongly depends on the radiative corrections and thus on
the values of the mixing parameters A and µ. In contrast, the trilinear Higgs self-couplings
show a weak dependence on the radiative corrections when evaluated for the physical Higgs
masses. In Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 the trilinear Higgs self-couplings and the gauge-Higgs couplings
are given as a function of MA for two representative values of tan β, i.e. tan β = 3, 50.
Around MA = 120 GeV the couplings vary rapidly for large tan β. This region corresponds
to the cross-over of the mass branches in the neutral CP-even Higgs sector, cf. Eq. (2.47). As
can be inferred from Fig. 5.3 the couplings involving a pair of pseudoscalar Higgs bosons are
rather small compared to the couplings involving pure CP-even Higgs states. Note also that
the trilinear Higgs couplings may become zero for some parameter values. Fig. 5.4 demonstrates for λhhh and λHhh the modification of the trilinear couplings when mixing effects are
included. Evidently, the change is rather small. The mixing effects are also discussed in
Ref. [104].
At e+ e− linear colliders there are many processes which involve the trilinear MSSM Higgs-

Table 5.1 shows which trilinear couplings are involved in the various processes, cf. Fig. 5.5.
If all cross sections would yield sufficiently high signal rates, the system could be solved for
all λ’s up to discrete ambiguities by using the double Higgs-strahlung and the triple Higgs
production processes Ahh and AAA [”bottom-up-approach”]. The processes ZAA and AAA
can be used to solve for the couplings λ(hAA) and λ(HAA). The processes Zhh and Ahh
provide the couplings λ(hhh) and λ(Hhh). Subsequently the process ZHh can be exploited
to extract the coupling λ(HHh) and finally ZHH for the determination of λ(HHH) The
remaining triple Higgs production processes AHh and AHH provide additional redundant
information.
In practice, not all the cross sections can be measured experimentally since some are too
small. In this case, however, one can compare the theoretical predictions of the cross sections
with the experimental results for the accessible channels and by this means test the trilinear
Higgs couplings stringently [”top-down approach”].
In the MSSM, the couplings involving a CP-odd Higgs boson pair, i.e. λ(hAA) and
λ(HAA), are small. The analysis can then be carried out without making use of the processes ZAA and AAA. [The validity of this approach can be checked experimentally in a
model-independent way: Assuming the knowledge of the predetermined couplings between
gauge and Higgs bosons the measurement of σ(ZAA) and σ(AAA) provides an upper bound
on λhAA and λHAA .] The processes ZHi Hj and Ahh are then sufficient to solve for the
couplings among the neutral CP-even Higgs bosons in the manner described above, c.f. the

The processes e+ e− → ZHi A and e+ e− → ν¯e νe Hi A [Hi = h, H] with a CP even-odd
Higgs pair in the final state cannot be used to extract the trilinear Higgs self-couplings.
They are mediated by a virtual Z boson which subsequently decays into a parity-mixed
final state Z ∗ → Hi A. Hence, they only involve gauge interactions and no Higgs boson
self-interactions.

The first term in the coefficient a involves the trilinear Higgs self-coupling. The other terms
are due to sequential Higgs-strahlung and due to the 4-Higgs-gauge-coupling. The various
terms can be identified by analysing the propagators they are associated with.
The double Higgs-strahlung process is mediated by an s-channel Z boson. Since Z has
spin one it only couples to a left-handed electron and a right-handed positron and vice versa.
Due to CP-invariance the total cross section for double Higgs-strahlung therefore doubles if
electron-positron beams with opposite polarization are used.

mass for three typical e e collider energies, i.e. s = 500 GeV, 1 TeV and 1.6 TeV. The
electron-positron beams are taken oppositely polarized [λe− λe+ = −1] so that the cross section is enhanced by a factor two. Due to the s-channel Z boson propagator, the cross sections
show scaling behaviour beyond the threshold region. The arrows indicate the modifications
of the cross sections with a variation of the trilinear Higgs coupling from 1/2 to 3/2 in units
of the SM coupling. They increase with rising coupling. Fig. 5.7 illustrates the sensitivity
to λHHH if the coupling is varied in the range [−λHHH , 2λHHH ]. Evidently, the sensitivity
of the double Higgs-strahlung process to the value of the Higgs self-coupling is not washed
out by the irreducible background diagrams which do not involve λHHH . The influence of
these diagrams increases with rising energy so that the sensitivity to the trilinear coupling is

largest near the kinematic threshold as can be inferred form Fig. 5.8. This behaviour results
from the propagator of the virtual Higgs boson connecting the two real Higgs bosons which
is maximal near the threshold. Furthermore Fig.
√ 5.8 shows that the maximum√double Higgsstrahlung cross section is reached for energies s ∼ 2MH +MZ +200 GeV, i.e. s = 500 GeV
for Higgs masses in the lower part of the intermediate range. A c.m. energy of 500 GeV is
therefore a good choice in this mass range since the cross section as well as the sensitivity
to λHHH is maximal.

5.1.2

SM W W double-Higgs fusion

For high energies the logarithmic behaviour of the t-channel diagram contributing to the
W W fusion process, cf. Fig. 5.1, dominates over the scaling behaviour due to the Z boson
propagator in the s-channel of the double Higgs-strahlung process. Therefore the W W
double-Higgs fusion process provides the largest cross section at high c.m. energies for Higgs
masses in the intermediate range, especially when the initial state beams are taken oppositely
polarized.
In order to get a rough estimate of the cross section for W W double-Higgs fusion the
equivalent particle approximation [40, 105] can be applied. In this approximation the W
bosons are regarded as partons in the electron and positron, respectively, with the W bosons
taken on-shell. The production amplitude for the dominant longitudinal degrees of freedom

a rough estimate of the cross section for the process e+ e− → W W → HH ν¯e νe can be
obtained. Though the value of the exact calculation is overestimated by a factor 2 to 5,
depending on the collider energy, the approximated cross section is helpful for a transparent
interpretation of the exact result.
For high energies the cross section is dominated by the t-channel exchange which does
not include the trilinear Higgs self-coupling. The convoluted W W fusion process e+ e− →
HH ν¯e νe nevertheless remains sensitive to λHHH because the major contribution to the cross
section stems from the lower end of the W W spectrum so that also in the high-energy limit
the sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling is maintained.
In the subsequent analysis the exact values for the W W fusion cross sections have been
used with the W bosons being off-shell and the transverse degrees of freedom included. The
cross sections have been calculated numerically with the semi-analytical CompHEP program
[106]. The electron-positron beams are taken oppositely polarized thus enhancing the cross
section by a factor four since the W − boson only couples
√ to left-handed electrons. The
results are shown in Fig. 5.9 for three collider energies, s = 500 GeV, 1 TeV and 1.6 TeV,
as a function of the Higgs mass. As anticipated the W W fusion cross section increases with
rising energy. The arrows indicate the modification of the cross sections due to the variation
of the Higgs self-coupling from 1/2λHHH to 3/2 λHHH . Fig. 5.10 shows the variation of the
cross section with κλ, κ = −1 to 2. Due to destructive interference with the gauge diagrams
the cross section decreases with rising λHHH . As expected the sensitivity to a variation of
the Higgs self-coupling is smaller for high c.m. energies.
The cross sections for ZZ fusion are not shown because they are an order of magnitude
below the W W fusion values as can be inferred from Table 5.2. This is due to the smallness
of the Ze+ e− coupling.
The preceding discussion shows that for moderate energies double Higgs-strahlung e+ e− →
ZHH is the preferred channel for measurements of the trilinear Higgs-self couplings whereas
for energies in the TeV range W W double Higgs fusion e+ e− → W W → HH ν¯e νe is the
more suitable channel. Since for both processes the cross sections are nevertheless small
high luminosities as foreseen for e+ e− linear colliders are needed. A further enhancement

of a factor two for Higgs-strahlung and four for W W fusion can be achieved by taking the
electron-positron beams oppositely polarized. Clear multi-b signatures like e+ e− → Z(b¯b)(b¯b)
and e+ e− → (b¯b)(b¯b) + E/ will enable the separation of the signal from the background. Experimental simulations taking into account detector properties have demonstrated that for
Higgs masses in the intermediate range and an integrated luminosity of L = 500 fb−1 the
trilinear Higgs coupling may be determined with 20% accuracy [107].
For the reconstruction of the Higgs potential also the quadrilinear Higgs self-coupling
has to be determined. This coupling can in principle be measured directly in triple Higgs
production: e+ e− → ZHHH and e+ e− → HHH ν¯e νe . Yet, these cross sections are reduced
by three orders of magnitude with respect to the corresponding double Higgs production
cross sections. This is due to the suppression of the quadrilinear coupling compared to the
trilinear coupling and due to the additional particle in the final state so that the total signal
cross section is reduced by a factor [λ2HHHH λ40 /16/π 2 ]/[λ2HHH λ20 /MZ2 ] ∼ 10−3 . Likewise, the
irreducible background diagrams are suppressed. A few exemplifying results are given in
Table 5.3.

5.1.3

Double and triple Higgs production in the MSSM

In the MSSM the following trilinear self-couplings arise among the neutral Higgs bosons
hhh, Hhh, HHh, HHH
hAA, HAA
There are many more quadrilinear couplings [84]. The double and triple Higgs production
processes and the trilinear couplings involved are listed in Table 5.1. Since in most of the
MSSM parameter space the Higgs bosons H and A are heavy the emphasis of the subsequent
analysis will be on the production of a light Higgs boson pair with heavy Higgs boson final
states taken into account where necessary.
In contrast to the SM, the resonant production of a heavy Higgs boson H that subsequently decays into a light Higgs boson pair is possible. The resonant production is important

in part of the parameter space with H masses between 200 and 350 GeV and for moderate
values of tan β [70]. In this case the branching ratio obtained from the partial width

is neither too small nor too close to unity to be accessible directly. The resonant H decay
enhances the total production cross section for hh by an order of magnitude [23] thus improving the potential for the measurement of the Higgs self-coupling λHhh . Apart from the
exceptional case of a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson A the coupling λHhh is the only trilinear
Higgs self-coupling which is accessible via resonant decay. All the other couplings have to be
extracted from the continuum pair production. The generic diagrams contributing to double
and triple Higgs production and W W double Higgs fusion have been shown in Fig. 5.5.

5.1.4

MSSM double Higgs-strahlung

The (unpolarized) production cross section for a pair of light Higgs bosons via Higgsstrahlung in the MSSM has the same structure as in the SM yet involving H and A exchange

The notation is the same as in the Standard Model, with µ1 = Mh2 /s and µ2 = MH2 /s. Taking
into account that in part of the parameter space the heavy neutral Higgs boson H or the
pseudoscalar Higgs boson A may become resonant, the decay widths are included implicitly
by shifting the masses to complex values M → M − iΓ/2, i.e. µi → µi − iγi with the reduced
width γi = Mi Γi /s, and by replacing products of propagators π1 π2 with Re(π1 π2∗ ).

Fig. 5.11 shows the total polarized cross section Zhh for s = 500 GeV as a function
of the Higgs masses. The mixing parameters are chosen A = 1 TeV and µ = −1(1) TeV
for tan β = 3(50). Choosing tan β and Mh as input parameters the masses of the heavy
Higgs bosons are fixed in the MSSM for given values of the mixing parameters [70]. As
can be inferred from Fig. 5.11 the continuum cross section is smaller compared to the SM

result. This originates from the suppression of the MSSM vertices by sin / cos functions
of the mixing angles α and β. In contrast, the cross section is enhanced by an order of
magnitude when resonant H production with subsequent decay H → hh is kinematically
possible. Approaching the maximum value of Mh for tan β fixed, H and A become very
heavy and decouple so that the MSSM Zhh cross section reaches the SM value. Due to
the decoupling theorem resonant H production does not increase the MSSM cross section
for large values of tan β since the decay H → hh is kinematically not possible unless the
decoupling region is reached where the ZZH coupling is too small to produce a sizeable
cross section.
The formulae for the Higgs-strahlung processes ZHi Hj [Hi , Hj = h, H] are deferred to the
Appendix. They are more complicated due to the different masses of the final state Higgs
particles. The corresponding polarized cross sections are shown together with the SM cross
section as a function of Mh in Fig. 5.12. The c.m. energy is chosen equal to 500 GeV and
tan β = 3. Evidently, if kinematically possible, the cross sections Zhh, ZHh and ZHH add
up approximately to the SM result.

5.1.5

Triple Higgs production

The processes e+ e− → ZHi and e+ e− → AHi are proportional to sin2 (β −α)/ cos2 (β −α) and
cos2 (β − α)/ sin2 (β − α) for Hi = h, H, respectively, so that Higgs-strahlung and associated
Higgs production are complementary to each other. In addition the processes are among
themselves complementary [44]. Since the double and triple Higgs production processes
ZHi Hj , ZAA and AHi Hj , AAA proceed via virtual h, H bosons this behaviour will be
found there, too, being of more complex matrix form, however, since the combination of

The notation of the kinematics is the same as for double Higgs-strahlung.

The scaled mass parameter µ1 has to be replaced by µA in the coefficients gi and gi′ where
the functions gi′ are related to gi via gi′ (y1 , y2) = gi (y2, y1 ).
Fig. 5.13 shows the results for the triple Higgs production processes e+ e− → Ahh and
e e → AAA compared to double Higgs-strahlung e+ e− → Zhh and the SM counterpart,
e+ e− → ZHH. The triple Higgs processes are small in the continuum. This behaviour can be
explained by analysing the effective couplings. The process e+ e− → Ahvirt → Ahh involves
the coupling cos(β − α)λhhh and e+ e− → AHvirt → Ahh is proportional to sin(β − α)λHhh .
In both cases the products of the gauge and Higgs self-coupling are small as can be inferred
from Figs. 5.2 and 5.3. Only if resonant H production with subsequent H → hh decay is
kinematically allowed the cross section increases by about three orders of magnitude. The
process e+ e− → Ahvirt → AAA exhibits the effective coupling cos(β − α)λhAA , one of the
factors always being small, and e+ e− → AHvirt → AAA is proportional to sin(β − α)λHAA
with λHAA being of order 1/2. Taking into account the reduction of the phase space due
to three heavy Higgs bosons A in the final state the pseudoscalar triple Higgs production
process is always small.

The cross sections presented in Figs. 5.14 and 5.15 have been calculated exactly by means
of the program CompHEP [106] without using any approximations. The electron-positron
beams are taken oppositely polarized. The process involving a light Higgs bosons pair in
the final state is suppressed compared to the SM unless resonance H → hh decay is possible
for modest tan β values. In the case of large tan β the MSSM fusion process is much more
suppressed and resonance production does not play any rˆole since in this parameter range
the gauge couplings involved are very small. Yet, the H mass is rather light so that the
processes hh, Hh and HH approximately add up to the SM cross section. The formulae for
the longitudinal amplitudes WL WL → Hh, HH and AA can be found in the Appendix.

5.1.7

Sensitivity areas

In this subsection the perspectives for the determination of the Higgs self-couplings in the
SM and the MSSM will be analysed. For the MSSM case, the feasibility of measuring the
trilinear Higgs self-couplings shall be represented in compact form in sensitivity plots in the
[MA , tan β] plane [23, 83].
1.) SM WW Double Higgs fusion
Since for SM Higgs masses below 140 GeV the main decay channel is given by H → b¯b the
final state for the W W fusion process is characterized by two b¯b pairs and missing energy in
(∗)
this mass region. Analogously, for MH >
pairs
∼ 140 GeV the final state consists of two W W
(∗)
and missing energy since in this case H dominantly decays in W W , see Fig. 4.1. Possible
background processes yielding b¯bb¯b + E/ in the final state may proceed via the pure EW W W
fusion process being O(α6 ) or γγ fusion with a gluon exchanged between the b-quarks of
O(α4 αs2 ) whereas the signal process is O(α4 ). Hence the W W fusion background process is
suppressed by O(α2 ) compared to the signal. γγ fusion results in large event rates in forward
direction. In contrast the bottom quarks from the decay of the massive Higgs bosons are
back-to-back. Applying appropriate angular cuts will hence help to reduce the background
with respect to the signal. For MH >
∼ 140 GeV a possible background process is generated by
γγ fusion being suppressed by O(α2 ) compared to the signal.
2.) SM Double Higgs-strahlung
In analogy to W W fusion the double Higgs-strahlung process being O(α3 ) consists of a
(∗)
Z boson and two b¯b pairs in the final state if MH <
W W (∗) if
∼ 140 GeV and of ZW W
MH >
∼ 140 GeV. For the low mass range signal to background analyses have been performed
on parton level [99] as well as on detector level [102]. Assuming efficient b-tagging and
high purity sampling of b-quarks the main background is due to irreducible EW processes
of O(α5 ) and QCD backgrounds of O(α3 αs2 ). Another source is the intrinsic background

CHAPTER 5. SM AND MSSM HIGGS SELF-COUPLINGS

75

resulting from the signal diagrams which do not contain the trilinear Higgs self-coupling
λHHH . The parton level analysis demonstrates that after applying typical selection cuts the
signal to background
ratio which may be reached for MH = 110 GeV is S/B = 25/60/140 in
√
the case of s = 500/1000/1500 GeV [99]. These results are based on the assumption of a
very high luminosity (chosen equal to L = 1 ab−1 in [99]), excellent b-tagging performances
and high di-jet resolution.
Whereas the previous results have been obtained without taking into account detector
effects, the analyses of Ref. [102] are based on a detector simulation and include hadronization
effects. The examined final state consists of b¯bb¯bq q¯, the q q¯ pair resulting from the Z boson
decay. The study of the 6-jet topology demonstrates that for MH ∼ 100 GeV and L =
500 fb−1 a significance of 5 might be achievable, high b-tagging efficiency and purity provided
(ǫb = 0.85, ǫnot b = 0.9).
3.) MSSM Double Higgs-strahlung
For the process Zhh, there exists a parton level analysis of the signal to background ratio
[100, 101]. The final state is given by Zb¯bb¯b since h dominantly decays into b¯b independent of
the value of tan β [59, 70, 71]. A low and a high tan β scenario has been investigated, mixing
effects included (A = 2.4 TeV, µ = 1 TeV). After applying appropriate acceptance cuts the
main background results from pure EW and EW/QCD mixed processes. Applying selection
cuts according to the kinematics of the signal process, it yields 156 events for L = 500 fb−1
and tan β = 3, Mh = 104 GeV. For these parameters resonant H production with subsequent
decay H → hh is possible. The background only amounts to a 10% correction. In the case
of tan β = 50 where no resonant production is possible and the cross section is strongly
suppressed, only for Higgs masses in the decoupling limit a reasonable event rate of 15 may
be achieved. The analysis does not take into account b-tagging efficiency and Z boson decay.
The feasibility of measuring the trilinear Higgs self-couplings of the MSSM can be summarized in sensitivity plots in the [MA , tan β] plane [23, 83]. The sensitivity criteria for a
point in the plane to allow for the measurement of the trilinear coupling in the corresponding
channel have been chosen as follows:
(i) σ[λ] > 0.01 fb
(ii) eff{λ → 0} > 2 st.dev. for

L = 2 ab−1

(5.25)

The first criterion demands the value of the cross section of the examined process to be
larger than 0.01 fb, corresponding to at least 20 events for an integrated luminosity of
L = 2 ab−1 . The second condition is fulfilled if the effect of the trilinear coupling on the
cross section exceeds 2 standard-deviations. (The second criterion is changed slightly where
appropriate, cf. Figs. 5.16 and 5.17.) If more stringent cuts are applied the results will not
change dramatically, cf. Ref. [104]. The sensitivity areas have been analysed based on the
double Higgs-strahlung and triple Higgs production processes. W W double Higgs fusion
would provide additional information especially for higher c.m. energies. For the sake of
simplicity no mixing effects have been included.
Figs. 5.16 and 5.17 show the sensitivity areas for the trilinear couplings among the neutral
CP-even Higgs bosons. The c.m. energy has been chosen equal to 500 GeV for double
Higgs-strahlung
if at most one heavy Higgs boson is present in the final state. Otherwise
√
s = 1 TeV yields larger sensitivity regions. Likewise the areas for triple Higgs production
involving A are larger for 1 TeV. Unless interference effects become important the size of the
sensitivity areas in tan β can be explained by analysing the values of the effective couplings

λ sin(β − α) and λ cos(β − α) involved in the various channels. The couplings are shown
separately in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3. For large values of MA the areas are limited by phase
space effects and due to the suppression of the H and A propagators for large masses. The
figures show that the coupling λhhh is accessible in most of the parameter space whereas the
parameter range for the other couplings is much smaller.
The sensitivity areas have been constructed without taking into account any experimental
efficiencies and background effects so that the given results must be regarded as best case.
Considering experimental boundary conditions the areas will shrink. This effect may be
reduced, however, if sophisticated cuts on signal and background are applied.

5.2

Higgs pair production at the LHC

Higgs pair production at the LHC follows the same pattern as at the linear collider with
the exception that gluon-gluon fusion provides an additional channel. The partonic cross
sections can be derived from the corresponding e+ e− processes by replacing the couplings
appropriately. The cross sections at hadron level are obtained from the partonic results

Being of up to O(10 fb) in the SM case the results for the double Higgs production cross
sections at the LHC are larger than in e+ e− collisions. Yet, the signal processes are plagued
by an overwhelming QCD background

5.2.1

SM double Higgs production

The processes for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons in the final state at the LHC are
given by double Higgs-strahlung off W and Z bosons [86], W W and ZZ fusion [90–94] and
gluon-gluon fusion [61],[94–96], in generic notation:
double Higgs-strahlung
: q q¯ → W ∗ /Z ∗
→ W/Z + HH
W W/ZZ double-Higgs fusion : qq → qq + W W/ZZ → HH
gluon fusion
: gg → HH
Fig. 5.18 shows generic diagrams contributing to these processes. Since high energetic protons
contain a large number of gluons, gluon-gluon fusion [61], [94–96], provides an important
mechanism for Higgs pair production at the LHC. The fusion proceeds via heavy top-quark
triangle and box diagrams, cf. Fig. 5.18. As in the case of single Higgs production [109] QCD
radiative corrections play an important rˆole. In the limit MH2 ≪ 4Mt2 they yield a K factor

expected.
Fig. 5.19 shows the results of the Higgs pair production mechanisms as a function of the
Higgs mass in the intermediate mass range. The dominating process is gluon-gluon fusion
followed by W W + ZZ fusion being about one order of magnitude smaller. The ratio of
¯
W W to ZZ fusion is ∼ 2.3. For MH <
∼ 140 GeV, W W/ZZ fusion yields two bb pairs resulting
from the H decay in the final state. For MH >
∼ 140 GeV the final state is characterized by
(∗)
(∗)
W W W W . The additional light quark jets due to the fragmentation q → W/Z + q with
a transverse momentum of pT ∼ 12 MW/Z may be exploited to tag the fusion process. The
double Higgs-strahlung process W HH + ZHH provides the smallest cross section due to
the scaling behaviour, i.e. σ
ˆ ∼ 1/ˆ
s. Because of the smaller q q¯Z coupling W HH dominates
over ZHH by a factor of about 1.6. The arrows indicate the sensitivity of the double
Higgs production processes to a variation of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling in the range
[ 12 λHHH , 23 λHHH ]. The size of the cross sections does not exceed O(10 fb). High luminosities
are therefore needed to enable the extraction of the signal from the large QCD background.

5.2.2

Higgs pairs in the MSSM

There are many processes at the LHC which involve the trilinear MSSM Higgs self-couplings
[61, 83, 96, 97]:
double Higgs-strahlung

: q q¯ → W/Z + Hi Hj and W/Z + AA [Hi,j = h, H]

triple Higgs production

: q q¯ → AHi Hj

and AAA

W W/ZZ double-Higgs fusion: qq → qq + Hi Hj

gg fusion

: gg → Hi Hj ,

and qq + AA

Hi A and AA

As in the SM case also gluon-gluon fusion plays a rˆole in contrast to the linear collider. Since
in the major part of the parameter space H and A are quite heavy the main focus of the
subsequent analysis will be on the production of a light Higgs boson pair. The diagrams
contributing to the individual production processes are shown in Fig. 5.20. Some results will
also be presented for heavy Higgs boson final states. The cross sections are small unless they
include resonant decays. For example in the case of W Hh/ZHh they proceed via
q q¯ → Z ∗ → AH → ZHh
q q¯ → W ∗ → H ± H → W Hh

(5.28)

The corresponding diagrams are shown in Fig. 5.21. These resonant heavy Higgs boson
decays can largely enhance the cross sections. Since they only involve gauge interactions
they are useless for the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings, however.

are demonstrated in Fig. 5.22. For moderate values of tan β the order of the cross sections is
the same as in the SM. Yet, the cross sections rise enormously if cascade decays proceeding
via intermediate resonant heavy Higgs bosons [44]
H → hh,

A → Zh and H ± → W ± h

(5.30)

are kinematically possible. The resonant H decay increases the cross sections by up to 2
orders of magnitude giving rise to about a million events in gluon-gluon fusion. This channel
therefore allows for the light MSSM Higgs boson search at the LHC [9, 101, 110, 111]. The
resonant decay regions are indicated by arrows in Fig. 5.22. In the case of W hh also the
resonant decay H ± → W ± h leads to an enhancement of the cross section. The vertical
arrows illustrate the sensitivity to a variation of λHhh in the range [ 12 λHhh , 23 λHhh ]. In the
continuum region the same variation of λhhh induces a 10% modification of the cross sections.
For large values of tan β cascade decays do not play any rˆole since they are kinematically
forbidden until the decoupling region has been reached where they are not sizeable any
more, see Fig. 5.23. The gluon fusion cross section is nevertheless very large due to the
enhancement of the hbb Yukawa coupling ∼ mb tan β growing with tan β. Since this coupling
enters quadratically in the box diagram and only linearly in the triangle loop connecting the
gluons to the Higgs boson the sensitivity to the trilinear Higgs self-coupling is small. Yet,
the huge cross section leading to the multi-b final states pp → hh → (b¯b)(b¯b) with two
resonance structures and large transverse momenta allows for the h Higgs boson search in
the large tan β region at the LHC. The W W/ZZ fusion and Higgs-strahlung cross sections
are suppressed in the continuum compared to their SM counterparts until the decoupling
limit is reached. The heavy Higgs boson is fairly light in this parameter region so that
the cross sections with hh, Hh and HH final states approximately add up to the SM cross
section as can be inferred from Table 5.4 for some representative examples.
Fig. 5.24 shows the cross sections of double Higgs-strahlung involving a heavy and a light

give rise to an enhancement by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Mediated by pure gauge
interactions they cannot be exploited for the determination of the Higgs self-couplings.

Extraction of the signal

In Ref. [100, 101] the extraction of the double Higgs production signal in the channel
gg → hh → (b¯b)(b¯b)

(5.32)

has been studied both at parton level and in a more realistic detector simulation. As the
previous analysis has shown, in the SM case the gluon-gluon fusion cross section is of O(10 fb)
only. Bearing in mind the huge QCD background at the LHC the extraction of the SM signal
does not seem to be realistic. In contrast, in the case of the MSSM light Higgs boson h
there are regions in the MSSM parameter space where the signal is largely enhanced due to
resonant H production with subsequent decay H → hh. Independent of the value of tan β,
h dominantly decays into a b¯b pair [59, 70, 71] yielding a four b final state in gluon-gluon
fusion.
In the parton level analysis of Ref. [100, 101] the potential of extracting the trilinear Higgs
coupling λHhh in the resonant region has been investigated for the parameter set tan β = 3,
MA = 210 GeV, the mixing parameters A = −µ = 1 TeV and the common squark mass set
equal to 1 TeV. Assuming efficient b-quark tagging and high purity the main background is
4
) and QCD and EW
due to irreducible QCD modes [110] of O(αs4 ), EW processes of O(αem
2 2
mixed contributions of O(αs αem ). Applying typical LHC detector cuts to the partons and
selection cuts appreciating the kinematics of the signal process, the signal and background
rates can be reduced to the same level. In a conservative scenario the signal cross section
reduces to 102 fb and the background yields 453 fb. Assuming an integrated luminosity
of L = 100 fb−1 a sufficiently high signal to background ratio should be achievable. A

CHAPTER 5. SM AND MSSM HIGGS SELF-COUPLINGS

85

more realistic analysis based on a detector simulation predicts a signal rate of 38 events
per year after all efficiencies and selection cuts have been included [100, 101]. Though a
background study on detector level has not been performed yet the results from the parton
level analysis predict an encouraging level of background suppression thus demanding for a
detailed detector study. Nevertheless, according to the present results the signal seems to
be feasible in this parameter region.
For large values of tan β the signal is strongly enhanced due to the large Yukawa coupling
hb¯b as has been pointed out previously. Since the box diagram is more favored by this effect
than the triangle diagram the sensitivity to the Higgs self-couplings is lost. The large tan β
scenario may, however, provide an additional channel for the h detection at moderate MA
values. The detector simulation yields for the signal 1044 events for Mh = 105 GeV and
A = µ = 1 TeV.
Though the QCD background is very large the determination of the self-coupling λHhh
seems feasible at the LHC in the cascade decay H → hh. In the large tan β regime the
extraction of the coupling will be very difficult since no resonance production takes place
and the signal sub-process is dominated by the box diagram contributions. In this case,
however, the gluon fusion process can be exploited for the light scalar Higgs boson search.
The experimental determination of the remaining trilinear Higgs couplings at the LHC will
be a difficult task. Since h cannot decay in a pair of pseudoscalar Higgs states and H → AA
is kinematically forbidden in the considered MSSM parameter space, trilinear couplings
involving pseudoscalar Higgs bosons have to be extracted from the continuum. The same
holds true for λhhh , λHHh and λHHH which are not involved in cascade decays. The continuum
signal might be swamped by the jetty QCD background if it is not rejected sufficiently well.

Chapter 6
Conclusions
This thesis has presented a theoretical analysis of the properties of the SM and MSSM Higgs
bosons which can be investigated at the LHC and e+ e− linear colliders.
The search for Higgs bosons is crucial to prove their existence. Although there are several
production mechanisms at the LHC that allow to find the SM or the MSSM Higgs bosons,
experimental studies exhibit a region around moderate values of tan β where the heavy
MSSM Higgs particles H and A may escape detection. An alternative to the search for
H and A at the LHC is provided by Higgs boson production at γγ colliders which may be
realized by Compton backscattering of laser light from high-energy electron/positron beams.
The most promising search channels with large branching ratios are given by the Higgs decays
into b¯b, tt¯, τ + τ − and chargino or neutralino pairs. They have been investigated by including
the polarized NLO results for the signal, background and interference processes and also
the resummation of higher orders where necessary. Polarization of the electron/positron
and laser beams helps to increase the significances by suppressing the helicity modes of the
background processes, that are not compatible with the signal.
For the anticipated luminosities at future γγ colliders, the b¯b mode develops sufficiently
high significances for the H and A discovery in the whole analysed mass range from 200 to
800 GeV for moderate and large values of tan β. The restriction to two-jet topologies in the
final state and a cut in the scattering angle of the b-quark with respect to the beam axis
have been crucial for the reduction of the background. Since the Higgs Yukawa coupling to
τ + τ − increases with tan β, also the τ + τ − channel provides a discovery potential in parts of
the A/H mass range for large values of tan β. For the tt¯ and chargino decay channels the
extraction of the signal will be more challenging due to larger backgrounds. The Higgs search
in the neutralino channel is confronted with decay products stemming from charginos beyond
the corresponding kinematic thresholds. This is due to the final states of the neutralino and
chargino cascade decays being rather similar because of the escaping LSP and neutrinos.
The different decay topologies may be exploited, however, in order to extract the signal.
Summarizing the results, γγ fusion at e+ e− linear colliders provides a valuable alternative
for the heavy Higgs boson search in a variety of decay channels of which the b¯b mode is
outstanding.
In addition to the mass, the second basic feature characterizing Higgs particles is their
lifetime, or equivalently their total width. Mechanisms that can be exploited at e+ e− linear
colliders for the determination of the small lifetime of a SM Higgs boson in the intermediate
mass range have been compared. They use the relation Γtot = Γi /BRH→i where Γi denotes
87

88

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS

the partial width and BRH→i the branching ratio of the Higgs decay into the final state
i. The γγ channel allows a model-independent determination of Γtot . Alternatively, the
lifetime can be measured in the W W channel. Due to possible anomalous HW W couplings
involved in the W W fusion process, the analysis is model-dependent. However, the model
dependence will be reduced for small momentum transfer at the HW W vertex. The error
of the lifetime extracted from the W W mode is smaller than in the γγ channel. Taking into
account the uncertainties in the various cross sections the total width can be deduced with
an accuracy better than 10% for Higgs bosons with MH <
∼ 160 GeV from the W W mode.
A qualitative discussion has demonstrated that the lifetime of a light MSSM Higgs scalar h
can be determined from the b¯b channel. The b¯b branching ratio occurs in the Higgs-strahlung
process and the Higgs Yukawa coupling to b-quarks is accessible in associated production of
h with a b¯b pair.
To complete the profile of the Higgs bosons their self-couplings have to be measured. The
knowledge of the Higgs self-interactions allows the reconstruction of the Higgs potential and
thus the experimental verification of the Higgs mechanism. In this thesis the theoretical
framework has been set up for the measurement of the trilinear Higgs couplings. They are
accessible in double and triple Higgs production. The processes for SM Higgs bosons in the
intermediate mass range and for MSSM Higgs particles turn out to be small at e+ e− linear
colliders. Although at the LHC the cross sections are larger, the signal is confronted with a
large QCD background. The extraction of the Higgs self-couplings will therefore be easier in
an e+ e− environment where the background is significantly smaller. For high luminosities,
the trilinear self-coupling of an intermediate mass Higgs boson can already be measured in
the first step of a linear collider, i.e. at c.m. energies of 500 GeV. High b-tagging efficiency
provided, the experimental accuracy in λHHH will be ∼ 20%.

The MSSM with five physical Higgs states includes six trilinear Higgs couplings among the
neutral particles and many more quadrilinear self-couplings. The trilinear couplings are involved in a large number of processes at e+ e− linear colliders and the LHC. In e+ e− collisions,
the coupling among three light Higgs bosons h can be extracted from continuum production. Apart from the decoupling limit, this coupling differs strongly from the corresponding
SM value. The remaining couplings among CP-even Higgs bosons will also be accessible,
though in a smaller range of the basic input parameters MA and tan β. The trilinear couplings involving pseudoscalar Higgs states are small in the MSSM and the measurement of
double and triple Higgs production processes will impose upper bounds on the size of these
couplings. At the LHC, the signal is plagued by an enormous QCD background. Resonant
decays H → hh provide a means of extracting the Hhh coupling. The measurement of
the other couplings will be more difficult since they have to be extracted from continuum
production.

in this appendix. The notation is the same as in section 5.1.2.

function, λ2ij = (1 − µi − µj )2 − 4µi µj . Furthermore,

xW = (1 − µi − µj )/(βW λij )

WLWL → AA

Since there are only a few diagrams involved in the process WL WL → AA and since the
masses of the final state particles are equal, the amplitude and cross section adopt a much
simpler form for pseudoscalar Higgs bosons:
MLL =

Asymptotic energies

In the high-energy limit the leading part of the W W fusion cross sections does not depend
on the trilinear couplings Hi Hj Hk or Hi Hj A. After convolution with the W luminosities,
however, the dominant contribution to the leptonic cross sections e+ e− −→ ν¯e νe Hi Hj and
AA stems from the threshold regions, independent of the e+ e− energies. These processes are
therefore also in the high-energy limit in leading order sensitive to the trilinear couplings.
