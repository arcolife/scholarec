Introduction

To begin with we are going to consider the inverse spectral problem for one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger operator with periodic potential. In the late 60-s the famous discovery of the
Inverse Scattering Transform for the KdV equation was done. A periodic analog of this
transform was found in 1974. It is based on the solution of the following inverse spectral
problem:
to describe effectively the ”isospectral manifold” of all the potentials with a given spectrum
on the line (i.e. the spectrum of Schr¨odinger operator acting in the Hilbert space of square
integrable complex-valued functions on the line R).
As everybody working in the quantum solid state physics knows, this spectrum generically is a union of infinite number of intervals (allowed bands) on the energy line ǫ. The
complementary part on the energy line is also a union of infinite number of intervals (gaps
or forbidden bands) whose lengths tend to zero for ǫ → +∞.

The periodic problem was solved in 1974-75 for the so-called finite-gap potentials that
have only a finite number of gaps. Any periodic potential can be approximated by the
finite-gap ones. This solution involves combination of the theory of Riemann surfaces and
their θ-functions, Hamiltonian dynamics of special completely integrable systems and the
spectral theory of Schr¨odinger operator. The mathematical technique used was (and still is)
unusual for the community of physicists. Later the necessity to use this kind of mathematics
appeared also in other branches of mathematical and theoretical physics (for example, in the
string theory, matrix models, and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]). It seems to the authors this technique in future will be needed to
the broad community of theoretical physicists.

Integrability of the famous KdV equation ut = 6uux +uxxx was discovered in 1965-68 (see
[16, 17, 18]) for the rapidly decreasing initial data on the line x. Exact solutions for the KdV
equation expressing u(x, t) through the inverse scattering data of the Schr¨odinger operator
L = −∂x2 + u(x, 0) were found. This procedure has been called the Inverse Scattering
Transform (IST). It was extended later for some other highly nontrivial (1 + 1)-systems
including such famous systems as Nonlinear Schr¨odinger NS± : iψt = −ψxx ± |ψ|2 ψ and
Sine(Sinh)-Gordon equations SG : uxt = sin u or uxt = sinh u. Note, that for the SG equation
a large family of exact solutions was already constructed in XIX century by Bianchi, Lie and
B¨acklund (see in [19, 20, 21]). Beginning with 1974, several (2 + 1)-dimensional physically
interesting systems have been discovered as integrable by the IST procedure. The most
famous of them is the KP system (see [22, 23]).
It is necessary to emphasize that the IST procedure in its original form can not be
applied to the solution of the periodic problem (i.e. u(x, t) is periodic in the variable x).
This problem was solved on the base of the new approach proposed in [24], in the works
[25, 26, 27, 29, 28, 30, 31](see the surveys [32, 35, 37]). An extension of this method to
(2 + 1)-systems was found in [33, 34, 35]. New development of this approach associated with
two-dimensional Schr¨odinger operator was started in 1976 (see [36, 37, 39, 38, 41, 42, 43]).
Complete detailed description of the solution of the periodic problem can be found in the
2

surveys, Encyclopedia articles [40], and in the book [44]. We are going to present here basic
ideas of this theory in the simplest form possible. Let us point out that KdV as well as other
nontrivial completely integrable by IST PDE systems are indeed completely integrable in any
reasonable sense for rapidly decreasing or periodic (quasi-periodic) boundary conditions,
only. In fact, even that is well established for few of them. For example, for the KdV any
periodic solution can be approximated by the finite-gap solutions. This statement easily
follows from the theory of finite-gap potentials if we do not try to preserve the period, i.e.
in the class of all quasi-periodic finite-gap potentials. The approximation of any periodic
potential by the finite-gap potentials with exactly the same period, was constructed on the
base of other approach developed in [46]. The extension of the theory of Riemann surfaces
and θ-functions to the specific class of surfaces of the infinite genus associated with periodic
Schr¨odinger operator, was done in [47]. This theory is a beautiful description of the infinite
limit. However, it seems that all fundamental properties of θ-functions associated with the
complex continuation of variables, are lost in this limit. It is interesting to point out that
analogous (but more complicated) theory of Riemann surfaces of the infinite genus was
developed later in [41] for the periodic 2D Schr¨odinger operators.
Outside these functional classes almost no effective information is known. Beautiful
methods have been developed also for the studies of the special self-similar and ”stringtype” solutions, but in most cases they lead to the very hard analytical problems associated
with the famous Painleve equations and their generalizations ([48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 52, 54, 55]).

Rapidly decreasing potentials and GGKM Procedure. B¨
acklund Transformations

Let us recall the basic information about the IST method for KdV. We start from the so-called
Lax Representation for KdV (see [18]). The Heisenberg type equation for the Schr¨odinger
operator L
Lt = [L, A] = LA − AL,
(2.1)
L = −∂x2 + u, A = −4∂x3 + 3(u∂x + ∂x u),

(2.2)

is equivalent to the identity (KdV equation)
ut = 6uux + uxxx .

(2.3)

For this reason, any KdV type equations admitting some analog of the Lax representation is
called isospectral deformations. The existence of such deformations indicates the possibility
of effective solution of the Inverse Scattering Problem for the operator L.
For the rapidly enough decreasing functions u(x, t) → 0, x → ±∞ we define two bases of
solutions (t is fixed):
φ± (x, t; k) ∼ exp±ikx ,

ψ± (x, t; k) ∼ exp±ikx ,

x → −∞, Lφ± = λφ± ,

x → +∞, Lψ± = λψ± , k 2 = λ.
3

(2.4)
(2.5)

By definition, monodromy matrix T connects these two bases, T φ = ψ for the column vectors
φ = (φ+ , φ− ), ψ = (ψ+ , ψ− ):
T =

a b
c d

, ψ+ = aφ+ + bφ− , ψ− = cφ+ + dφ− .

(2.6)

A conservation of the Wronskian implies that det T = ad − bc = 1. For the real values of
¯ c = ¯b. Therefore, |a|2 − |b|2 = 1. The whole set of the so-called
k or λ > 0 we have a = d,
inverse scattering data can be extracted from the monodromy matrix T if it is well-defined
for all complex values of k. The so-called scattering matrix is constructed from T for the
real k. Its entries are the transmission coefficient 1/a and the reflection coefficient ¯b/a. The
property b = 0 for all real values of k characterizes reflexionless or multisoliton potentials.
For all rapidly decreasing potentials the matrix element a(k) is well-defined for complex k
such that Im k > 0 and a → 1 for k → ∞, Im k > 0. There is only a finite number of
purely imaginary zeroes a(kn ) = 0 in this domain. They correspond to the discrete spectrum
λn = kn2 < 0.
The famous result of [17] (GGKM procedure) easily follows from the Lax representation,
which implies the equation:
−4ik 0
0
4ik

Tt = [T, Λ], Λ =

(2.7)

This result was formulated as a set of the following GGKM formulas
at = 0, bt = −8(ik)3 = −ct , dt = 0.

(2.8)

The latter equations give a full description of KdV dynamics in these variables because any
rapidly decreasing potential can be reconstructed from the inverse scattering data. A special
family of the reflexionless potentials where b = 0 for real values of k, leads to the so-called
multisoliton solutions for KdV equation (see [44].)
The multisoliton solutions can be also directly obtained with the help of the elementary
substitutions (B¨aclund Transformations) transforming any solution of the KdV into another
solution: let u be a solution of the KdV equation and v be a solution of the Ricatti equation
α + u = vx + v 2 with the initial value independent of time. The new function u˜ = −vx + v 2
satisfies the KdV equation. Starting from the trivial solution u = u0 = 0 we construct
a sequence of potentials u˜n−1 = un , n > 0, given by the B¨acklund Transformation. We
choose parameters αn , α1 > α2 > . . . > αn > . . ., and take the real nonzero functions
fn → ∞, x → ±∞, −fnxx + un−1fn = αn fn , which define vn = (log fn )x . Every such
sequence leads to the multisoliton reflexionless potential:
u0 = 0, u1 = −

ch2 (

√

2α
, ...
α(x − x0 ) + βt)

(2.9)

In terms of the Schr¨odinger operator this transformation (invented by L.Euler in 1742) is
called Darboux Transformation. The operator L can be factorized
L = −∂ 2 + u = −(∂ + v)(∂ − v).
4

Using the non-commutativity of these factors, we define the Darboux Transformation for the
operator and its eigenfunction in the following way:
˜ = −∂ 2 + u˜ = −(∂ − v)(∂ + v), ψ˜ = (∂ + v)ψ .
L

(2.10)

These transformations can be considered as some kind of discrete spectral symmetries for
Schr¨odinger operators. They preserve a spectrum of the operator L (maybe except for one
eigenfunction).

KdV Hierarchy. Integrals of motion. Hamiltonian
formalism.

The local integrals for the KdV equation can be constructed with the help of the Schr¨odinger
operator. Consider the associated Riccati equation vx + v 2 = u − k 2 and find the solution
for it as a formal series in the variable k:
∞

vn (x)(ik)−n ,

v(x, k) = ik +

(3.1)

n=1

where all vn are polynomials in the variables u, ux , . . . The integral along the line x is a
k-dependent constant of motion for the KdV equation
∂t

v(x, k)dx = 0, ut = 6uux + uxxx .

(3.2)

For the real potentials u(x, t) and real k we can see that the imaginary part of v(x, k) − ik
is a total derivative. The remaining quantities in the expansion :
vn (x)(ik)−n dx.,

(3.3)

v2n+3 (x)dx, n = −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(3.4)

(v(x, k) − ik)dx =

n≥1

define local integrals of motion
In = cn

where cn are constants. After the proper choice of the constants cn we have
I−1 =

udx, I0 =

u2 dx, I1 =

(u2x /2 + u3 )dx, . . . ,

Int = 0, ut = 6uux + uxxx .

(3.5)
(3.6)

Let us introduce a GZF Poisson bracket [56, 57] on the space of functions
{u(x), u(y)} = δ ′ (x − y)).

(3.7)

Then any functional H (Hamiltonian) defines the corresponding Hamiltonian system
δH
.
δu(x)

ut = ∂x
5

(3.8)

For the case H = I−1 we get a trivial flow (i.e. this integral is a Casimir for the GZF
bracket). For H = I0 we are coming to the x-translations ut = ux . Let us call this equation
KdV0 . For the case H = I1 we have the ordinary KdV = KdV1 . Higher integrals give us
the equations KdVn of the order 2n + 1 admitting the Lax representations with the same
Schr¨odinger operator L but with the differential operators An = (const)∂x2n+1 + . . . :
utn = ∂x

δIn
δu(x)

= [L, An ].

(3.9)

In particular, A0 = ∂x , A1 = A. Nice formula for all operators An can be extracted from
[58].
Let L = −L2 , where L = ∂x + k≥1 ak (u, ux , . . .)∂x−k . Here all ak are polynomials in the
variables u, ux , . . . and ∂x−1 a = n≥0 (−1)n a(n) ∂x−n−1 for the composition of the operator ∂ −1
and multiplication operator by a. By definition,
An = (L2n+1 )+ = (L2n+1/2 )+ ,

(3.10)

where the sign + means omitting of all strictly negative powers of ∂x .
All higher KdVn systems can be integrated by the same IST procedure for the class of
rapidly decreasing functions. In particular, GGKM equations for the scattering data (or
monodromy matrix) have the form
Ttn = [T, Λn ], Λn = (const)

(ik)2n+1
0
0
(−ik)2n+1

.

(3.11)

The latter result also implies that all these flows commute with each other. Hence, we get
the following conclusion without any calculation:
integrals In have zero Poisson brackets,
{In , Im } =

δIn
δIm
∂x
dx = 0.
δu(x) δu(x)

(3.12)

A generalization of the GZF Poisson bracket for the isospectral deformations of the higher
order (scalar) Lax operators L was found in [59].
It should be emphasized that there exists a family of local field-theoretical Poisson brackets (LM-brackets, [60]) describing the KdV theory:
B = B(λ,µ) = λ∂x + µ(−∂x3 + 4u∂x + 2ux ) = λB0 + µB1 ,

(3.13)

{u(x), u(y)}λ,µ = Bδ(x − y),

(3.14)

{In , Im }λ,µ = 0.

(3.15)

These brackets were generalized for the higher order operators L in [61].
The recurrence operator B1 B0−1 = C generates all the right-hand sides of all higher KdV
systems:
δIn−1
.
(3.16)
C(0) = ux , C 2 (0) = 6uux − uxxx , . . . , C n (0) = ∂x
δu(x)
6

It gives also a simple proof of a very useful identity ([62]):
δIn
dx = (const)In−1 .
δu(x)

(3.17)

All these identities are local and can be used for the class of periodic functions as well.
However, we shall see in the next section that the direct analog of GGKM procedure does
not lead to the integration procedure. We are going to use a different approach.

Spectral theory of periodic Schr¨
odinger operators.
Finite-gap potentials

The spectral theory for the periodic potentials on the whole line x is based on the monodromy
matrix as in case of the scattering theory. However, in the periodic case with a period
T < ∞, we have nothing like the selected point x = ∞ for the definition of the monodromy
matrix (as it was for the rapidly decreasing case (T = ∞)–see Section 2 above). Any
point x0 can be used. Let us fix initial point x0 and choose a special basis of the solutions
C(x, x0 , ǫ), S(x, x0 , ǫ) for the spectral equation LC = ǫC, LS = ǫS such that for x = x0 we
have:
C S
C x Sx

=

1 0
0 1

(4.1)

The shift operator T : x → x + T in the basis C, S defines the monodromy matrix
a b
c d

T (x0 , ǫ) =

,

C(x + T ) = a C(x) + b S(x), S(x + T ) = c C(x) + d S(x).

(4.2)
(4.3)

The key element of the periodic spectral theory is a notion of the, so-called, Bloch waves or
Bloch-Floquet eigenfunctions. We present here some essential properties of these functions
without any proofs. An exposition of this theory may be found in the Encyclopedia article
[40], where the main ideas of the proofs are clearly presented for the difference Schr¨odinger
operator (it is much simplier).
By definition, the Bloch-Floquet functions are solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation that
are at the same time eigenfunctions of the shift operator, i.e.
Lψ = ǫψ, T ψ(x) = ψ(x + T, ǫ) = exp(±ip(ǫ)T )ψ(x).

(4.4)

We uniquely normalize ψ by the condition ψ|x=x0 = 1.
For any complex number ǫ the eigenvalues, w± (ǫ) = exp(±p(ǫ)T ), of the shift operator
are defined by the characteristic equation for the monodromy matrix. ¿From the Wronskian
property it follows that det T = 1. Therefore, the characteristic equation has the form
w 2 − (tr T )w + 1 = 0.
7

(4.5)

Figure 1:
The multivalued function p(ε) is called quasi-momentum.
The spectrum of the Schr¨odinger operator on the whole line is a union of spectral zones
which are segments of the real line of the variable ǫ, where the quasi-momentum is real. The
latter condition is equivalent to the inequality:
|Tr T | = 2 cos(pT ) ≤ 2.

(4.6)

The typical graph of the function f (ǫ) = cos(pT ) is presented on the fig 1. In particular, its
extreme points f ′ (ǫ) = 0 ”generically” are located inside of the gaps (i.e. for the open and
everywhere dense set of periodic potentials we have |f | > 1 at the extreme points, and there
is only one extremal point in each gap). For some special cases we may have f = ±1 at
the extreme point. Such point lies inside the spectral zone. However, generic perturbations
create new small gap nearby this point — see fig 2. This point is a double point of periodic
or anti-periodic spectrum with the boundary conditions ψ(x) = ±ψ(x + T ).

The Riemann surface of the Bloch-Floquet functions is defined by the equation
z 2 = cos(p(ǫ)T ),

(4.7)

but this surface is nonsingular only for the generic case (when there are no double points of
the periodic or anti-periodic problem for the Schr¨odinger operator). For the large ǫ → +∞
the following asymptotics is valid for the gaps (see fig. 3).
1. The length of gaps tends to zero with its rate depending on the smoothness of the
potential (this rate is exponential for the analytic potentials).
2. All gaps are located nearby the points ǫm = 4π 2 m2 T −2 , and the distance of gap from
this point tends to zero.
A nonsingular Riemann surface of the Bloch-Floquet solutions is defined with the help
of the equation
z 2 = (ǫ − ǫ0 )(ǫ − ǫ1 ) . . . (ǫ − ǫn ) . . . ,
(4.8)
where ǫ0 < ǫ1 < . . . , are simple eigenvalues of the periodic and anti-periodic spectral problems.

points ǫm = 4πm2 T −2 for ǫ → ∞. Here m are the integer numbers.
As it follows from the Lax representation for all higher KdVn systems (3.9), these boundary spectral points for the periodic operator L in the Hilbert space L2 (R) of the square
integrable complex-valued functions on x–line are integrals of motion for the KdV hierarchy.
We can say that the Riemann surface of the Bloch-Floquet solutions as a whole is an
integral of motion for the KdV hierarchy. How many potentials correspond to the same
Riemann surface (i.e. have the same spectrum in L2 (R))?
The original idea to introduce a special class of potentials for which this problem can
be solved effectively was proposed in [24] and is based on the KdV hierarchy. This idea
naturally combines two different ways to describe the corresponding isospectral manifold of
potentials. Both are in fact closely related to each other.
9

The first approach – use of the KdV hierarchy and Hamiltonian dynamics:
Let us consider a stationary equation for some linear combination of higher KdVn flows
(3.9). It is an ordinary differential equation that can be written in the form:
δ(In + c1 In−1 + . . . + cn I0 + cn+1 I−1 ) = 0.

(4.9)

This is a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system with n degrees of freedom depending on
n + 1 parameters c1 , . . . , cn+1 . It is a completely integrable Hamiltonian system because
there is a pencil of the commuting flows. This pencil coincides with the restriction of all
higher KdVm on this stationary subset of functions given by the equation (4.9). Therefore,
its generic nonsingular solution is expected to be a periodic or quasiperiodic function of x.
In the next section we shall construct for (4.9) some kind of the Lax representation
n+1

Λx = [Q(x, λ), Λ(x, λ)], Λ = Λn +

ck Λ k ,

(4.10)

k=1

using 2 × 2 traceless matrices depending on the parameter λ and (u, ux , . . .) polynomially. In
the today terminology some people call them loop groups. Note that in all soliton systems this
λ-loops have very specific λ-dependence (polynomial, rational and in some exotic examples
– elliptic functions).
Lax representation (4.10) implies that an algebraic Riemann surface defined by characteristic equation
det(Λ(λ) − zI) = P (λ, z) = 0,
(4.11)

does not depend on x and therefore is an integral of (4.9). The same Riemann surface can be
extracted from the commutativity equation [L, A] = 0, which according to (3.9) is equivalent
to (4.9).
It should be emphasized that the latter form of (4.9), i.e. the commutativity condition
for two ordinary differential operators
[L, An +

ck An−k ] = [L, A] = 0, L = −∂x2 + u,

(4.12)

was considered formally (i.e. locally in the variable x without any periodicity assumptions)
as a pure algebraic problem in 1920-s (see [63, 64]). Even the formal algebraic Riemann
surface (4.11) appeared as a relation P (L, A) = 0.
According to our logic however, the corresponding system of equations in the variable x is
Hamiltonian and completely integrable. Therefore, its generic solution is quasiperiodic in x,
containing a dense family of periodic solutions. We may ask about the spectrum of the corresponding operators L in L2 (R) and boundaries of gaps. Remarkably, they exactly coincide
with the branching points of the Riemann surface defined by equation (4.11). Therefore, for
the periodic potential which satisfy equation (4.9) the nonsingular spectral Riemann surface
of the Bloch-Floquet solutions is an algebraic Riemann surface of genus g = n. The spectrum
of such an operator contains only a finite number of gaps [ǫ2j−1 , ǫ2j ], j = 1, . . . , n.
This key step unifies the first approach with the second one (below). So the solution of
the inverse spectral problem can be identified with the process of solution of some special
families of completely integrable systems using Riemann surfaces.

Figure 4: The endpoints of gaps ǫj are the branching points of the 2-sheeted
Riemann surface. The poles γj are located in the gaps on one branch only. (Here
n = 3)

The second approach – periodic spectral theory in the Hilbert space L2 (R):
For any periodic Schr¨odinger operator L = −∂ 2 + u(x = t0 , t1 , . . .) we have already
defined the Riemann surface Γ of Bloch-Floquet solutions with the help of the monodromy
matrix T . For the finite-gap potentials a graph of the function f = cos(p(ǫ)T = 1/2tr T is
highly degenerate (see fig.2 and compare with fig.1). For all real and large enough ǫ we have
|f | ≤ 1.
Once again, we ask how to describe all the potentials with the same finite-gap spectrum
and what are additional variables which uniquely define a finite-gap potential? It turns out
that these additional spectral data are the poles of the Bloch-Floquet functions. It can by
shown that the Bloch-Floquet solutions defined by (4.4) and normalized by the condition
ψ|x=x0 = 1 have exactly one simple pole γj (x0 ) inside each gap or on its boundary. A
point of the hyperelliptic surface Γ (4.8) can be represented as the complex number ǫ and
a sign (or a branch) of the radical z = (ǫ − ǫ0 )(ǫ − ǫ1 ) · · ·. The branches of the radical
coincide at the boundaries of gaps. Therefore, each gap should be considered as a closed
cycle aj , j = 1, 2, . . . n (see fig. 4). Any pole of ψ should be considered as a point γj on the
cycle aj . The above-mentioned statement that there is only one pole in a gap means, in
particular, that ψ has no pole at the point (γj , +) if it already has pole at (γj , −) and vice
versa. Geometrically, the total set of poles (γ1 , . . . , γn ) represents a point on the real torus
T g = a1 × . . . × an . As we shall see later, this set of poles completely determines the original
potential. Different points of the real torus lead to the different potentials (if normalization
point x0 is fixed).

Periodic analog of GGKM. Zero Curvature representation for the KdV hierarchy and corollaries

As it was emphasized above, the definition of the monodromy matrix in the periodic case
depends on a choice of initial point x0 . For different choices of the initial point the corresponding monodromy matrices are conjugated (because they represent the same linear
transformation in different bases). Therefore, a dependence of the monodromy matrix with
respect to the choice of the initial point x0 can be described by the equation:
Tx0 = [Q(ǫ, x0 ), T ], Q =

11

0
1
ǫ − u(x0 ) 0

.

(5.1)

In the same way, for the isospectral deformations corresponding to the KdV hierarchy (i.e,
all higher KdVn systems) we can establish the following equations (the periodic analogs of
GGKM):
Ttj = [Λj , T ], Λ0 = Q, t0 = x0 .
(5.2)
A compatibility condition of equations (5.2) for any pair of variables ti , tj implies the following
zero curvature representation for the KdV hierarchy (where periodic boundary conditions are
already inessential)
[∂ti − Λi , ∂tj − Λj ] = 0.
(5.3)

Using the Lax representations (3.9) for all higher KdVn , we can express all the matrices Λj as
polynomials in the variable ǫ and variables u(x0 ), ux0 (x0 ), . . .. For example, for the ordinary
KdV we have (replacing x0 by x):
Λ1 =

−ux
2u + 4ǫ
2
−4ǫ + 2ǫu + 2u − uxx
ux
2

(5.4)

The matrices Λk can be completely reconstructed from equations (5.3) and from the following
properties of matrix elements:
Λk = (const)

ak bk
ck d k

,

(5.5)

dk + ak = TrΛk = 0, bk = ǫk + u/2ǫk−1 + . . . ,

(5.6)

det Λk = −(a2 + bc) = (const)R2k+1 (ǫ) = (const)(ǫ2k+1 + . . .),

(5.7)

2ak = −bkx , (R2k+1 )x = −bk .

(5.8)

For i = 0, equations (5.3), where t0 = x, give the zero-curvature representation for the KdVn
system:
(5.9)
∂x Λn − ∂tn Q = [Q, Λn ].

From this representation and from the periodic analog of GGKM we are coming to the
following results for the stationary higher KdVn system (4.10):
1. The monodromy matrix T commutes with Λ
[T, Λ] = 0.

(5.10)

Therefore, they have common eigenvectors. It implies, in particular, that the Bloch-Floquet
function ψ± is single-valued on the algebraic Riemann surface associated with the matrix Λ;
2. The stationary higher KdV admits an ǫ-parametric Lax-type representation in the
variable x (4.10):
(Λ)x = [Q, Λ], Λ = Λn +

ck Λ k .

(5.11)

Therefore, we have a full set of conservation laws organized in form of the Riemann surface
(i.e. all coefficients of the polynomial P are x-independent):
det(Λ(ǫ) − zI) = P (ǫ, z) = 0,
12

(5.12)

P (ǫ, z) = z 2 − R2n+1 (ǫ) = (const)(ǫ − ǫ0 ) . . . (ǫ − ǫ2n ).

(5.13)

These points ǫj are exactly the boundaries of gaps for periodic potentials because the Riemann surfaces of the matrices T and Λ coincide. The matrix element b12 for the matrix Λ
determines another set of points
b12 (ǫ) = (const)(ǫ − γ1 ) . . . (ǫ − γn ).

(5.14)

These points coincide with projections of the zeroes of Bloch wave ψ± as the functions of
the variable x or poles as the functions of x0 (see the next section).
An original approach to the solution of the inverse spectral problem was based on the
use of the following trace type formula for the potential:
− u(x)/2 + const = γ1 (x) + . . . γn (x).

(5.15)

¿From (5.11) and (5.14), “Dubrovin equations” defining dynamics in x of the points γj can
be derived. They have the form
√
R2n+1 (γj )
(5.16)
γjx =
k=j (γj − γk )
These equations (see [27, 32]) can be linearized by the, so-called, Abel transformation.
Consider the first kind differentials on the Riemann surface (i.e. holomorphic 1-forms
without poles anywhere - even at the infinity). The basic first kind forms are

Following the classical XIX century theory of Riemann surfaces, formulas (5.15-5.21) lead
to some expression of the potential through the θ-functions avoiding the calculation of the
eigenfunction ψ± (see [25, 27, 29, 31]). The most beautiful θ-functional formula for the
potential was obtained in the work [29].
However, in the next section we shall not follow this approach for solving the inverse
problem which has been outlined above, but use another approach proposed for the first
time in the article [32] (see appendix, based on the idea of A.Its): it is possible to calculate
all the family of the Bloch-Floquet functions. The original approach has been used later in
the problems, where the effective calculation of eigenfunction is impossible (like in the cases
of higher rank commuting OD linear operators (see for example [37]).

Solution of the periodic and quasiperiodic inverse
spectral problems. Baker-Akhiezer functions

We are going to solve the inverse spectral problem for the finite-gap potentials following the
scheme proposed in [33, 34, 35] and based on the concept of the Baker-Akhiezer functions.
These functions are uniquely defined by their analytical properties on the spectral Riemann
surface. As we shall see later this scheme is evenly applicable to the solution of inverse
problems in two-dimensional case where the corresponding analytical properties naturely
generalize the analytical properties of the Bloch-Floquet solutions for finite-gap Schr¨odinger
operators.
Let us start with the following real inverse spectral data:
14

1. Riemann surface Γ given in the form
z 2 = (ǫ − ǫ0 ) . . . (ǫ − ǫ2n ),
where all numbers ǫj are real;
2. a set of n real points γj ∈ Γ such that there is exactly one point γj on the cycle aj .

Below we shall for brevity identify the point γj as a point on Γ with its projection on
complex ǫ–plane. The condition that there is only one point on each cycle means that
projection of the points satisfy the restriction:
ǫ2j−1 ≤ γj ≤ ǫ2j , j = 1, . . . n,

(6.1)

By definition, the complex inverse spectral data are the same data where the Riemann surface
(i.e. its branching points ǫk ) and the points γj ∈ Γ are arbitrary complex points.

As we shall see below a generic set of algebraic-geometric spectral data leads to the
explicit solution of the inverse spectral problem in terms of the Riemann theta-function. The
corresponding potentials are complex meromorphic quasi-periodic functions of the variable x.
For the real data described above, we are coming to the smooth (even analytic) quasiperiodic
potentials with their periods expressed through the hyperelliptic integrals (see below). It is
necessary to mention that there is no way to find simple and effective criteria for the potential
to be periodic in terms of these data. The periods depend on the Riemann surface, only.
Of course, we may write the condition that all the corresponding hyperelliptic integrals are
commensurable, however this condition in transcendental. Recently, based on the results of
[7, 65], the effective numerical approach has been developed for the solution of this problem.
It is based on the discovery of some specific dynamic systems on the set of potentials which
preserve all the periods but change spectrum. Following [65], we start from one periodic
potential and create all others using these dynamic systems.
In the last section we shall present some examples of finite-gap potentials written in terms
of elliptic functions. They are periodic in the variable x (even double-periodic as functions
of the complex variable x). The first nontrivial examples different from the classical Lame
potentials u(x) = n(n + 1)℘(x) were found in [25]. This subject was developed in the works
[66, 67, 68, 69, 70].
We define the Baker-Akhiezer function ψ = ψ(x, t1 , . . . tn ; P ) for the parameters x, tj and
the point P = (ǫ, ±) ∈ Γ, by its analytical properties on Γ with respect to the variable P .
For the case t1 = t2 = · · · = 0 these analytical properties are just the same as the analytical
properties of the Bloch-Floquet solutions of the periodic finite-gap operator.
¿From pure algebraic-geometric arguments it follows that there exists a unique function
ψ such that
1. it is meromorphic on Γ outside the infinity and has at most simple poles at the points
γj , j = 1, . . . , n;
2. in a neighborhood of the infinity the function ψ has the form
ψ = exp[xk + t1 k 3 + . . . + k 2n+1 tn ](1 + ξ1 (x, t)k −1 + ...) ,
15

where k 2 = ǫ and therefore, k −1 is a local coordinate on the Riemann surface near infinity.
A proof of this statement is identical to the proof of the existence and uniqueness of general Baker-Akhiezer functions that were introduced in [33] for construction of exact solutions
of two-dimensional KP equation and all associated Zakharov-Shabat hierarchies.
General Baker-Akhiezer function is defined with the help of an arbitrary Riemann surface
of finite genus n instead of special hyperelliptic (i.e. two-sheeted) surfaces. We fix an
arbitrary ”infinity” point P0 on it; local coordinate k −1 = w where w(P0 ) = 0 ; generic set of
points (γ1 , . . . , γn ), and numbers (x = τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τk , . . .). The corresponding Baker-Akhiezer
function has the same analytical properties as above but, (2) is replaced by the following:
ψ = exp[xk + τ1 k 2 + τ2 k 3 + . . .](1 + ξ1 (x, τ )k −1 + . . .) .

(6.2)

For the KdV hierarchy we have a hyperelliptic Riemann surface, k 2 = ǫ, and τ2k = 0, τ2j+1 =
tj .
The use of such type of functions (dependent only on a single parameter x) has been
proposed by Baker in his note [71], for the common eigenfunctions of two commuting OD
linear operators. He expected that this construction will improve the results of [63, 64]. He
made also very interesting conjecture that this approach may seriously improve the classical
theory of θ-functions. Unfortunately, this program was not realized and was forgotten. The
soliton theory appeared many decades later absolutely independently. In the 70-s it started
to use such kind of functions on Riemann surfaces in the process of solution of a periodic
problem for the KdV type systems and inverse spectral periodic problems. In the classical
spectral theory Akhiezer ([72]) was the first to use some special cases of this function for the
construction of some examples of operators on the half-line x ≥ 0 with interesting spectral
properties. No one of the authors before the 70-s had associated anything like that with
periodic problems. Indeed, this type of functional construction on the Riemann surface was
extracted in 1974 from the work [72].
We shall prove the existence and uniqueness of the Baker-Akhiezer function and present
its exact expression through the θ-functions later. At this moment we would like to show
how the uniqueness of this function leads to the proof that ψ is an eigenfunction for the
Schr¨odinger operator for our special case. Apply twice the operator ∂ = ∂x to this function
and use analytical properties. After elementary calculation, we are coming to the formulas:
∂ψ = kψ + exp[kx + . . .](ξ1x k −1 + . . .),
∂ 2 ψ = k 2 ψ + 2ξ1x ψ + O(k −1 ) exp[kx + . . .].

(6.3)

¿From the latter equations, we get the equality
(∂ 2 − k 2 − 2ξ1x )ψ = O(k −1) exp[kx + . . .].
The left-hand side is globally well-defined function on the same Riemann surface because
k 2 = ǫ. It has the same poles independent of parameters. Up to the same exponential factor,
it is of the order O(k −1 ) at the infinity. Therefore, it is equal to zero due to the uniqueness
of the Baker-Akhiezer function.
16

So we are coming to the conclusion that
Lψ = ǫψ, L = −∂ 2 + u, u = −2ξ1x .

(6.4)

We can apply the operators ∂j = ∂tj to the function ψ:
∂j ψ = k 2j+1 ψ + exp[kx + . . .](ξ1j k −1 + ξ2j k −2 ).

(6.5)

As in the previous case, we can easily construct a linear operator Aj = ∂x2j+1 + . . . with the
coefficients independent of k such that (∂j − An )ψ = O(k −1 ) exp(kx + . . .). Using global
analytical properties on the Riemann surface, we deduce from this that the left-hand side is
equal to zero as before. The compatibility condition of these pairs of equations is exactly a
KdVn -system for the potential u(x, t1 , . . . , tm ).
Following the works [33, 34, 35], we can prove in the same way that for the general
Baker-Akhiezer function ψ(x, τ, P ) associated with arbitrary Riemann surface with fixed
local coordinate near a puncture, the following equations are valid:
(∂τk − Lk )ψ = 0, k = 2, 3, . . . .

(6.6)

Here Lk = ∂xk + . . . are linear OD operators acting on the variable x with coefficients depending on parameters τ . These coefficients are differential polynomials in the coefficients of
the expansion of the regular factor of the Baker-Akhiezer function at the puncture (infinity).
They are uniquely defined by the condition that the expansion of the left-hand side of (6.6)
at the puncture has the form O(k −1 )ψ.
The compatibility conditions
[∂τj − Lj , ∂τk − Lk ] = 0.

(6.7)

are equivalent to non-linear partial differential equations for the coefficients of the operators
Lk . For the case j = 2, k = 3, τ2 = y, τ3 = z, the operators L2 and L3 have the form
3
L2 = ∂x2 − u(x, y, t), L3 = ∂x3 − u∂x + w(x, y, t),
2

(6.8)

where we consider the dependence of the coefficients with respect to the first three variables
τ1 = x, τ2 = y, τ3 = t, only . The coefficient u(x, y, t) is equal to u = 2ξ1x (x, y, t), where ξ1 is
the first coefficient of the expansion (6.2).
¿From (6.7) we get a system of two equations for two coefficients u(x, y, t) and w(x, y, t)
which can be reduced for an equation for u(x, y, t). The reduced equation is the famous KP
equation
3uyy = (4ut − 6uux + uxxx )x .
(6.9)
It appeared in physics literature for the investigation of the transversal stability of the KdV
solitons (see [73]) and is one of the most natural physical two-dimensional analogs of KdV.
Lax representation for it was found in [22, 23]. We call the whole set of higher systems (6.7)
the KP hierarchy. We shall discuss the periodic problem for this equation at greater length
in the next section.
17

√
For the special choice of the hyperelliptic Riemann surface and k = ± ǫ we have k 2s = ǫs ,
where the function ǫ is well-defined globally as a meromorphic function on the Riemann
surface Γ. Therefore, we may represent globally the corresponding Baker-Akhiezer function
in the form
ψ = ψ˜ exp(τ2 k 2 + τ4 k 4 + . . .),

(6.10)

where ψ˜ does not depend on the parameters τ2j . So in this case all the KP hierarchy reduces
to the KdV hierarchy.
The relationship of this constructions with commuting OD linear operators is as follows.
Let f (P ) be a meromorphic function on the Riemann surface Γ with one pole at the puncture
P0 . Its negative part written in the parameter k is some polynomial q(k) = q1l + q2 k l−1 +
. . . + ql k. Apply the operator Af = q1 Ll + q2 Ll−1 + . . . + q1 ∂x to the function ψ. By the
definition of the operators Lk , we can see that
(Af − f )ψ = O(k −1)ψ.

(6.11)

We conclude as before, that the difference Af ψ − f (P )ψ = 0.

For any pair of functions f and g on the Riemann surface Γ with poles at the point ∞,
we get a pair of the commuting OD scalar linear operators Af , Ag such that Af Ag = Ag Af .
In a special case of the hyperelliptic Riemann surface z 2 = (ǫ − ǫ0 ) . . . (ǫ − ǫ2n ), we have pair
of functions f = ǫ, g = z, leading to the Schr¨odinger operator L = −∂x2 + u commuting with
the second operator of order 2n + 1, because z = k 2n+1 + . . .
Now we return back to the problem of existence and uniqueness of the Baker-Akhiezer
function. The simplest way to prove this existence is to define this function by exact formula in terms of the θ-function and meromorphic differentials. Let us recall first necessary
information.
As in the previously discussed case of hyperelliptic curves, we introduce a basis of cycles
aj , bj , j = 1, . . . , g, on a Riemann surface Γ of genus g with canonical matrix of intersections:
ai · bj = δij , and a basis ωi of holomorphic differentials normalized by the condition
ai

ωj = δij .

(6.12)

The matrix B = (Bij ) of b-periods of these differentials
Bij =

bi

ωj ,

(6.13)

is symmetric and has positively defined imaginary part. The Riemann θ-function is a function
defined with the help of this matrix by the formula:
e2πi(z,m)+(Bm,m)

θ(z|B) =

(6.14)

m∈Z g

where z = (z1 , . . . , zg ) is a complex g-dimensional vector, (m, z) stands for a standard scalar
product and summation is taken over all integer vectors m = (m1 , . . . , mg ). Theta-function
18

is an entire periodic function of g variables zj and has the following monodromy properties
with respect to the shifts defined by vectors Bk which are columns of the matrix of b-periods:
θ(z + Bk ) = e−2πizk −πiBkk θ(z).

(6.15)

The basic vectors ek and the vectors Bk define a lattice L in C g which determines gdimensional complex torus J(Γ) = C g /L called Jacobian of the curve. The Abel map
A : Γ → J(Γ) is defined by the formula
Ak (P ) =

P
P0

ωk .

(6.16)

Note that the vector A(P ) with coordinates Ak (P ) depends on the choice of path of integration but its ambiguity just coincides with shifts by vectors of the lattice L.

¿From the monodromy properties of θ-function it follows that zeros of the multivalued
function θ(A(P ) + Z) considered as a function on Γ are well-defined. For a generic vector
Z this function has exactly g zeros (γ1 , . . . , γg ). The vector Z can be expressed in terms of
Abel transforms of these points by the formula
g

Z=−

A(γj ) + K,

(6.17)

j=1

where K is a vector of the Riemann constants.
Let us introduce a set of meromorphic differentials dΩi that are holomorphic on Γ outside
the puncture where they have poles of the form
dΩi = dk i (1 + O(k −i−1 )),

(6.18)

and normalized in a usual way by the condition
ai

dΩj = 0.

The Abelian integrals
Ωi (P ) =

P

(6.19)

dΩi

(6.20)

dΩj .

(6.21)

are multivalued functions on Γ.
Let Uj be a vector with the coordinates
Ujk =

1
2πi

bk

Then from the statements presented above, it follows directly that the formula
τi Ωi (P ))

ψ(τ, P ) = exp(
i

θ((A(P ) + i Ui τi + Z)θ(Z)
,
θ(A(P ) + Z)θ( i Ui τi + Z)

(6.22)

correctly defines a function on Γ which satisfies all the properties of the Baker-Akhiezer
function.
19

Suppose now that there exists another Baker-Akhiezer function ψ1 . ¿From the definition
the Baker-Akhiezer functions it follows that the ratio ψ1 /ψ is a meromorphic function on Γ
which is equal to 1 at the puncture and with only possible poles at the zeros of the function
ψ. According to (6.22) the zeros of ψ are zeros of the function θ(A(P ) + i Ui τi + Z).
Therefore, ψ has g zeros. The simplest form of the Riemann-Roch theorem (which can be
considered as generalization of the Liouville theorem for Riemann surfaces) implies that a
function on Γ with at most g poles at a generic set of points is a constant. Therefore, ψ1 = ψ
and the existence and uniqueness of the Baker-Akhiezer function is proved.
Now according to the previously established formula u = 2∂x ξ1 , in order to get an exact
formula for a solution of the KP hierarchy it is enough to take the first coefficient ξ1 (τ ) of
the expansion of the pre-exponential factor in (6.2) at the puncture. Finally we obtain the
expression
(6.23)
u(τ ) = 2∂x2 log θ( Ui τi + Z) + const
i

for the finite gap solutions of the whole KP hierarchy.
If we consider only the KP equation, we get the formula
u(x, y, t) = 2∂x2 log θ(Ux + V y + W t + Z) + const,

(6.24)

where we redenote x = τ1 , y = τ2 , t = τ3 and U = U1 , V = U2 , W = U3 .
For the case of the hyperelliptic curve the vector V = 0 and we get the Its-Matveev
formula for the finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation.
The formula (6.24) derived in [34, 35] has led to one of the most important pure mathematical applications of the theory of non-linear integrable systems. This is the solution of
the famous Riemann-Shottky problem.
According to the Torrelli theorem, the matrix of b-periods of normalized holomorphic differentials uniquely defines the corresponding algebraic curve. The Riemann-Shottky problem
is: to describe symmetric matrices with the positive imaginary part which are the matrices
of b-periods of normalized holomorphic differentials on algebraic curves. One of the authors
conjected that the function u(x, y, t) given by (6.24) is a solution of the KP-equation iff the
matrix B that defines the theta-function is the matrix of b-periods of normalized holomorphic
differentials on an algebraic curve and U, V, W are vectors of b-periods of corresponding normalized meromorphic differentials with the only pole at a point of this curve. This conjecture
was proved in [74].

Spectral theory of two-dimensional periodic operators. KP hierarchy

A general algebraic-geometric construction of the finite-gap potentials for the Schr¨odinger
operators and for solutions of the KP hierarchy that was presented in the previous section
has been developed extensively in years. It is applicable for all soliton systems which are

20

equivalent to various types of compatibility conditions for over-determined systems of auxiliary linear problems. In its algebraic form it is in some sense local and is a sort of inverse
transform: from a set of algebraic-geometrical data to solutions of the integrable non-linear
partial differential equations
{algebraic − geometrical data} −→ {solutions of NLP DE}

(7.1)

In a generic case the space of algebraic-geometrical data is a union for all g of the spaces
˜ g,N = {Γg , Pα , kα−1 (Q), γ1 , . . . , γg }, α = 1, . . . , N,
M

(7.2)

where Γg is an algebraic curve of genus g with fixed local coordinates kα−1 (Q), kα−1 (Pα ) = 0,
in neighborhoods of N punctures Pα , and γ1 , . . . , γg are points of Γg in a general position.
˜ g,N are “universal” data. For the given non-linear integrable
(It is to be mentioned that M
equation the corresponding subset of data has to be specified.)
A’posteriory it can be shown that these solutions can be expressed in terms of the corresponding Riemann theta-functions and are quasi-periodic functions of all variables. Whithin
this approach it is absolutely impossible to give an answer to the basic question: ”How
many algebraic-geometrical solutions are there? And what is their role in the solution of the
periodic Cauchy problem for two-dimensional equations of the KP type?”
The answer of the corresponding question in lower dimensions is as follows. For finite
dimensional (0+1) systems a typical Lax representation has the form
∂t U(t, λ) = [U(t, λ), V (t, λ)],

(7.3)

where U(t, λ) and V (t, λ) are matrix functions that are rational (or sometimes elliptic)
functions of the spectral parameter λ. In that case all the general solutions are algebraicgeometrical and can be represented in terms of the Riemann theta-functions.
For spatial one-dimensional evolution equations of the KdV type (1+1)-systems) the
existence of direct and inverse spectral transform allows one to prove (though it is not
always the rigorous mathematical statement) that algebraic-geometrical solutions are dense
in the space of all periodic (in x) solutions.
It turns out that the situation for two-dimensional integrable equations is much more
complicated. For one of the real forms of the KP equation that is called the KP-2 equation
and coincides within (6.9), the algebraic-geometrical solutions are dense in the space of all
periodic (in x and y) solutions ([41]). It seems, that the same statement for the KP-1 equation
which can be obtained from (6.9) be replacing y → iy is wrong. One of the most important
problems in the theory of two-dimensional integrable systems which are still unsolved is: ”in
what sense” the KP-1 equation ahich has the operator representation (6.7) and for which a
wide class of periodic solution was constructed, is an ”non-integrable” system.
The proof of the integrability of the periodic problem for the KP-2 equation is based on
the spectral Floquet theory of the parabolic operator
M = ∂y − ∂x2 + u(x, y),
21

(7.4)

with periodic potential u(x + l1 , y) = u(x, y + l2 ) = u(x, y). We are going now to present
the most essential points of this theory which was developed in [41]. It is the natural
generalization of the spectral theory of the periodic Sturm-Liouville operator. We would
like to mention that despite its application to the theory of non-linear equations and related
topics, the structure of the Riemann surface of Bloch solutions of the corresponding linear
equation that was found in [41] has been used as a starting point for an abstract definition
of the Riemann surfaces of the infinite genus ([75]).
Solutions ψ(x, y, w1, w2 ) of the non-stationary Shr¨odinger equation
(σ∂y − ∂x2 + u(x, y))ψ(x, y, w1, w2) = 0

(7.5)

with a periodic potential u(x, y) = u(x + a1 , y) = u(x, y + a2 ) are called Bloch solutions, if
they are eigenfunctions of the monodromy operators, i.e.
ψ(x + a1 , y, w1, w2 ) = w1 ψ(x, y, w1, w2 ),

(7.6)

ψ(x, y + a2 , w1 , w2 ) = w2 ψ(x, y, w1, w2 ).

(7.7)

The Bloch functions will always be assumed to be normalized so that ψ(0, 0, w1, w2 ) = 1.
The set of pairs Q = (w1 , w2 ), for which there exists such a solution is called the Floquet set
and will be denoted by Γ. The multivalued functions p(Q) and E(Q) such that
w1 = eipa1 , w2 = eiEa2
are called quasi-momentum and quasi-energy, respectively.
The gauge transformation ψ → eh(y) ψ, where ∂y h(y) is a periodic function, transfers the
solutions of (7.5) into solutions of the same equation but with another potential u˜ = u−σ∂y h.
Consequently, the spectral sets corresponding to the potentials u and u˜ are isomorphic.
Therefore, in what follows we restrict ourselves to the case of periodic potentials such that
a1
0 u(x, y)dx = 0.
To begin with let us consider as a basic example the “free” operator M0 = σ∂y − ∂x2 with
zero potential u(x, y) = 0. The Floquet set of this operator is parameterized by the points
−1 2
of the complex plane of the variable k w10 = eika1 , w20 = e−σ k a2 , and the Bloch solutions
−1 2
−1 2
have the form ψ(x, y, k) = eikx−σ k y . The functions ψ + (x, y, k) = e−ikx+σ k y are Bloch
solutions of the formal adjoint operator (σ∂y + ∂x2 )ψ + = 0.
An image of the map k ∈ C −→ (w10 , w20) is the Floquet set for the free operator M0 . It
is the Riemann surface with self-intersections. The self-intersections correspond to the pairs
k = k ′ such that wi0(k) = wi0(k ′ ), i = 1, 2. The latter conditions imply the equations
k − k′ =

where N and M are integers. Hence, all the resonant points have the form
k = kN,M =

22

(7.9)

The basic idea of the construction of the Riemann surface of Bloch solutions of the equation
(7.5) that was proposed in [41] is to consider (7.5) as a perturbation of the free operator,
assuming that the potential u(x, y) is formally small.
For any k0 = kN,M it is easy to construct a formal Bloch solution. It turns out that the
corresponding formal series converges and defines a holomorphic function of k0 for |k0 | > M
big enough and lies outside small neighborhoods of the resonant points. Moreover, it can be
shown that this function can be extended on the Riemann surface that can be thought as a
surface obtained from the complex plane by some kind of surgery that creates gaps in places
of the resonant points.
More precisely, if u(x, y) is a smooth real potential that has analytical continuation in
some neighborhood of the real values of x and y, then the corresponding Riemann surface
of Bloch-Floquet solutions can be described in the following way.
Let us fix some finite or infinite subset S of integer pairs (N > 0, M) . The set of pairs
of complex numbers π = {ps,1, ps,2 } where s ∈ S would be called “admissible”, if
Re ps,i =

πN
, |ps,i − ks | = o(|ks |−1 ), i = 1, 2,
a1

(7.10)

and the intervals [ps,1 , ps,2] do not intersect. (Here ks , s = (N, M) are resonant points.)
Let us define the Riemann surface Γ(π) for any admissible set π. It is obtained from the
complex plane of the variable k by cutting it along the intervals [ps,1 , ps,2] and [−¯
ps,1 , −¯
ps,2 ]
and by sewing after that the left side of the first cut with the right side of the second cut
and vice versa. ( After this surgery for each cut [ps,1, ps,2 ] corresponds to a nontrivial cycle
as on Γ(π).)
For any real periodic potential u(x, y) which can be analytically extended into some
neighborhood of the real values x, y, the Bloch solutions of the equation (7.5) are parameterized by points Q of the Riemann surface Γ(π) corresponding to some admissible set π.
The function ψ(x, y, Q) which is normalized by the condition ψ(0, 0, Q) = 1 is meromorphic
on Γ and has a simple pole γs on each cycle as . If the admissible set π contains only a
finite number of pairs, then Γ(π) has finite genus and is compactified by only one point P1
(k = ∞), in the neighborhood of which the Bloch function ψ has the form (6.2).

The potentials u for which Γ(π) has finite genus are called finite-gap. They coincide with
the algebraic-geometrical potentials. The direct spectral transform for periodic operators
(7.4) allows us to prove that like in the one-dimensional case the finite-gap potentials are
dense in the space of all periodic smooth functions in two variables ([41]).

Spectral theory of two-dimensional Schr¨
odinger operator for fixed energy level and two-dimensional
Toda lattice

In this section we discuss a spectral theory of two-dimensional periodic Sch¨odinger operator.
Unlike the one-dimensional case, spectral data for 2D linear operator are over-determined
23

and therefore for generic operators there are no nontrivial isospectral flows. As it was noted
in [77], deformations that preserve spectral data for one fixed energy level do exist. An
analog of Lax representation for such system has the form
Ht = [A, H] + BH,

(8.1)

where H, A, B are two dimensional operators with coefficients depending on x, y, t. Equation
(8.1) is equivalent to the condition that operators H and (∂t − A) commute on the space of
solutions of the equation Hψ = 0. Therefore, (8.1) describes deformations preserving all the
spectral data associated with the zero energy level of the operator H.
It should be mentioned that until the moment when equations (8.1) were proposed in
the framework of the soliton theory the spectral problem associated with one energy level of
two-dimensional periodic operators had never been considered.
For the first time an inverse algebraic-geometric spectral problem for two-dimensional
Schr¨odinger operator in magnetic field
H = (i∂x − Ax (x, y))2 + (i∂y − Ay (x, y)2 + u(x, y)

(8.2)

was formulated and solved in [36].
Consider the Bloch solutions of the equation Hψ = ǫψ, which by definition are solutions
that at the same time are eigenfuctions for the shifts operators:
ψ(x + T1 , y) = eipx T1 ψ(x, y), ψ(x, y + T2 ) = eipy T2 ψ(x, y).

(8.3)

Here T1 , T2 are periods of the operator H, i.e. periods of the potential u(x, y) and periods of
the magnetic field B(x, y), which is defined by the vector potential (Ax , Ay ) by the formula
B = ∂y Ax − ∂x Ay .

Multivalued quantities px , py are components of the two-dimensional quasimomentum.
For fixed values of px , py a spectrum of the operator H restricted on the space of functions
satisfying (8.3) is discrete and defines different branches of dispersion relations ǫj (px , py ), j =
1, . . . Level lines ǫj (px , py ) = ǫ0 in the space of variables px , py define the, so-called, Fermi
curves. Of course, in the solid state physics all the considerations were restricted by real
values of quasi-momentum.
In [36] it was suggested to consider operators for which a complex Fermi curve does
exist and is the Riemann surface of finite genus for some energy level ǫ0 . Moreover, it was
assumed that this curve is compactified by two infinity points P± in neighborhoods of which
the corresponding Bloch solutions have the form

where k±
) are local coordinates in the neighborhoods of the punctures P± . It was also
assumed that outside the punctures the functions ψ(x, y, P ) considered as a function of the
variable P (which is a point of the complex Fermi curve Γ) is meromorphic function with g
poles independent of the variables x and y.

24

We present here a solution to this inverse spectral problem in a more general form which
is necessary for construction of exact solutions to the two-dimensional Toda lattice which
has deep connections with the theory of 2D Schr¨odinger operators. After that we return
back to the spectral problems.
Let Γ be a smooth algebraic curve of genus g with fixed local coordinates w± (P ) in
neighborhoods of the points P ± , w± (P ± ) = 0. Then for each set of g points γ1 , . . . , γg in
general position there exists a unique function ψn (T, P ), T = {t±
i , i = 1, . . . , ∞, } such that:

10 . The function ψn of the variable P ∈ Γ is meromorphic outside the punctures and has
at most simple poles at the points γs (if all of them are distinct);
20 . In a neighborhood of the point P ± it has the form

The proof of this statement, as well as the explicit formula for ψn in terms of Riemann
theta-functions, is almost identical to the way of solution of the inverse problem for finitegap Schr¨odinger operators discussed in the previous sections.

relations it follows that the vector of b-periods of this differential equals 2πiU (0) , where
U (0) = A(P − ) − A(P + ) .

(8.9)

As in the previous case, one can directly check that the function ψn (T, P ) given by the
formula:

Note that (8.12) imply that ψ0 satisfies the equation

(8.15)

which is gauge equivalent to (8.2) and therefore, we do get a solution of the inverse problem
that was introduced above.
The next important step was done in [38, 39] where algebraic-geometric spectral data
corresponding to potential 2d Schr¨odinger operators (i.e. operators with zero magnetic field)
were found.
−1
Let Γ be a smooth genus g algebraic curve with fixed local coordinates k±
(Q),
= 0, in neighborhoods of two punctures P± . Let us assume that there exists a
holomorphic involution of the curve σ : Γ −→ Γ such that P± are its only fixed points,
i.e. σ(P± ) = P± . The local parameters are to be ”odd”, i.e. k± (σ(Q)) = −k± (Q). The
factor-curve will be denoted by Γ0 . The projection
−1
k±
(P± )

π : Γ −→ Γ0 = Γ/σ

(8.16)

represents Γ as a two-sheet covering of Γ0 with the two branch points P± . In this realization
the involution σ is a permutation of the sheets. As there are only two branching points
g = 2g0 , where g0 is genus of Γ0 . Let us consider a meromorphic differential dΩ(Q) of the
third kind on Γ0 with residues ∓1 at the points P± . The differential dΩ has g zeros that will
be denoted by γˆi , i = 1, . . . , 2g0 = g. Let us choose for each i a point γi on Γ such that
π(γi) = γˆi , i = 1, . . . , g.

(8.17)

In [38, 39] it was shown that the Baker-Akhiezer function corresponding to algebraic-geometric data which have been just defined satisfies the equation
(∂+ ∂− + u(x, y))ψ(x, y, Q) = 0,

(8.18)

u = −∂− ξ1+ = −∂+ ξ1− ,

(8.19)

where

26

and ξ1± = ξ1± (x+ , x− ) are the first coefficients in the expansion (8.4).
It should emphasized that though general formula (8.10) in terms of the Riemann θfunctions is valid for the Baker-Akhiezer functions corresponding to the potential Shr¨odinger
operator H, in [38, 39] it was found another more effective representation in terms of the,
so-called, Prim theta-function.
A space of holomorphic differentials on Γ splits into two g0 -dimensional subspaces of
even and odd (with respect to the involution σ) differentials. A matrix of b-periods of odd
differentials defines the function θP r (z) by the same formula (6.14). Then
ψ=

θP r (Aod (Q) + U + x+ + U − x− − Z)θP r (Aod (Z)) i(p+ (Q)x+ +p− (Q)x− )

θP r (Aod (Q) − Z)θP r (U + x+ + U − x− − Z)

(8.20)

Here p± (Q) are Abelian integrals of the second kind normalized differential dp± on Γ that
have poles of the second order at the points P± , respectively; vectors 2πU ± are the vectors
of b-periods of these differentials.
As it was mentioned above the inverse algebraic-geometric spectral problem on one energy
level for 2D Schr¨odinger operator was posed and solved at the time when no direct spectral
theory was known. This theory was developed much later in [41], where it was shown that
the Bloch solutions for (8.18) with analytical periodic potential are parameterized by points
of infinite genus Riemann surface. It was proved that if this surface has finite genus, then
the Bloch functions have all the analytical properties suggested in the inverse problem and
therefore are just the Baker-Akhiezer-functions. Moreover, it was proved that algebraicgeometric (finite-gap) potentials are dense in the space of all periodic potentials.

Spectral theory of operators with elliptic coefficients

In this section we are going to discuss a specific spectral problem for operators with elliptic
coefficients, i.e. with the coefficients that are meromorphic functions of a variable x and
have two periods 2ω, 2ω ′, Im (ω ′ /ω) > 0.
Since Hermit time, it has been known that one-dimensional Schr¨odinger operator with
potential of the form n(n + 1)℘(x) (where ℘(x) = ℘(x|ω, ω ′) is Weierstrass ℘-function corresponding to elliptic curve with periods 2ω, 2ω ′, and n is an integer) has only n gaps in the
spectrum. These Lame potentials had been the only known examples with the finite-gap
property before the finite-gap theory was constructed in the framework of the soliton theory
(see above). As we already have shown a generic algebraic-geometric potential can be expressed in terms of higher genus Riemann θ-function. Sometimes higher genus formula can
be reduced to exact expression in terms of elliptic function.
The first example of this type which is different from the Lame potentials was proposed
in [25]. Later a theory of elliptic finite-gap potentials attracted the special interest due to
remarkable observation made in [78] on their connection with the elliptic Calogero-Moser
model. The most recent burst of interest is due to the unexpected connections of these
systems to Seiberg-Witten solution of N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories [14, 15]. It
27

turns out that the low energy effective theory for SU(N) model with matter in the adjoint
representation (identified first in [1] with SU(N) Hitchin system) is isomorphic to the elliptic
CM system. Using this connection quantum order parameters were found in [79].
The elliptic Calogero-Moser (CM) system ([80, 81]) is a system of N identical particles
on a line interacting with each other via the potential V (x) = ℘(x). Its equations of motion
have the form
x¨i = 4
℘′ (xi − xj ).
(9.1)
j=i

The CM system is a completely integrable Hamiltonian system, i.e. it has N independent
integrals Hk in involution ([82], [83]). The second integral H2 is the Hamiltonian of (9.1).
In [78] it was shown that the elliptic solutions of the KdV equations have the form
N

u(x, t) = 2
i=1

℘(x − xi (t))

(9.2)

and the poles xi (t) of the solutions satisfy the constraint j=i ℘′ (xi − xj ) = 0, which is the
locus of the stationary points of the CM system. Moreover, it turns out that the dependence
of the poles with respect to t coincides with the Hamiltonian flow corresponding to the
third integral H3 of the system. In [84, 85] it was found that this connection becomes
an isomorphism in the case of the elliptic solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvilii equation.
Moreover, in [66] it was revealed that the connection of the CM systems with the KP equation
is in some sense secondary and is a corollary of more fundamental connections with spectral
theory of linear operators with elliptic potentials. The corresponding approach has been
developed extensively in [67, 68, 69].
Let L be a linear differential or difference operator in two variables x, t with coefficients
which are scalar or matrix elliptic functions of the variable x. We do not assume any special
dependence of the coefficients with respect to the second variable. Then it is natural to
introduce a notion of double-Bloch solutions of the equation
Lψ = 0.

(9.3)

We call a meromorphic vector-function f (x), which satisfies the following monodromy properties:
f (x + 2ωα ) = Bα f (x), α = 1, 2,
(9.4)
a double-Bloch function. The complex numbers Bα are called Bloch multipliers. (In other
words, f is a meromorphic section of a vector bundle over the elliptic curve.)
In the most general form a problem that we are going to address is to classify and to
construct all the operators L such that equation (9.3) has sufficiently enough double-Bloch
solutions.
It turns out that existence of the double-Bloch solutions is so restrictive that only in
exceptional cases such solutions do exist. A simple and general explanation of that is due to
the Riemann-Roch theorem. Let D be a set of points xi , i = 1, . . . , m, on the elliptic curve
Γ0 with multiplicities di and let V = V (D; B1 , B2 ) be a linear space of the double-Bloch
28

functions with the Bloch multipliers Bα that have poles at xi of order less or equal to di and
holomorphic outside D. Then the dimension of D is equal to:
dim D = deg D =

di .
i

Now let xi depend on the variable t. Then for f ∈ D(t) the function Lf is a doubleBloch function with the same Bloch multipliers but in general with higher orders of poles
because taking derivatives and multiplication by the elliptic coefficients increase these orders.
Therefore, the operator L defines a linear operator
L|D : V (D(t); B1 , B2 ) −→ V (D ′ (t); B1 , B2 ), N ′ = deg D ′ > N = deg D,
and (9.3) is always equivalent to an over-determined linear system of N ′ equations for N
unknown variables which are the coefficients ci = ci (t) of expansion of Ψ ∈ V (t) with respect
to a basis of functions fi (t) ∈ V (t). With some exaggeration one may say that in the
soliton theory the representation of a system in the form of the compatibility condition of
an over-determined system of the linear problems is considered equivalent to integrability.
In all of the basic examples N ′ = 2N and the over-determined system of equations has
the form
LC = kC, ∂t C = MC,
(9.5)
where L and M are N × N matrix functions depending on a point z of the elliptic curve as
on a parameter. A compatibility condition of (9.5) has the standard Lax form ∂t L = [M, L],
and is equivalent to a finite-dimensional integrable system.
The basis in the space of the double-Bloch functions can be written in terms of the
fundamental function Φ(x, z) defined by the formula
Φ(x, z) =

σ(z − x) ζ(z)x
e
.
σ(z)σ(x)

(9.6)

Note, that Φ(x, z) is a solution of the Lame equation:
d2
− 2℘(x) Φ(x, z) = ℘(z)Φ(x, z).
dx2

(9.7)

¿From the monodromy properties it follows that Φ considered as a function of z is doubleperiodic:
Φ(x, z + 2ωα ) = Φ(x, z),
though it is not elliptic in the classical sense due to an essential singularity at z = 0 for
x = 0.
As a function of x the function Φ(x, z) is double-Bloch function, i.e.
Φ(x + 2ωα , z) = Tα (z)Φ(x, z), Tα (z) = exp (2ωα ζ(z) − 2ζ(ωα)z) .
In the fundamental domain of the lattice defined by 2ωα the function Φ(x, z) has a unique
pole at the point x = 0:
Φ(x, z) = x−1 + O(x).
(9.8)
29

The gauge transformation f (x) −→ f˜(x) = f (x)eax , where a is an arbitrary constant does
not change poles of any function and transforms a double Bloch-function into another doubleBloch function. If Bα are Bloch multipliers for f then Bloch multipliers for f˜ are equal to
˜1 = B1 e2aω1 , B
˜2 = B2 e2aω2 .
B

(9.9)

The two pairs of Bloch multipliers that are connected with each other through the relation
(9.9) for some a are called equivalent. Note that for all equivalent pairs of Bloch multipliers
the product B1ω2 B2−ω1 is a constant depending on the equivalence class, only.
¿From (9.8) it follows that a double-Bloch function f (x) with simple poles xi in the
fundamental domain and with Bloch multipliers Bα (such that at least one of them is not
equal to 1) may be represented in the form:
N

f (x) =
i=1

ci Φ(x − xi , z)ekx ,

(9.10)

where ci is a residue of f at xi and z, k are parameters related by Bα = Tα (z)e2ωα k . (Any
pair of Bloch multipliers may be represented in this form with an appropriate choice of the
parameters z and k.)
Let us consider as an example the equation
Lψ = (∂t − ∂x2 + u(x, t))ψ = 0,

(9.11)

where u(x, t) is an elliptic function. Then as shown in [66] equation (9.11) has N linear
independent double-Bloch solutions with equivalent Bloch multipliers and N simple poles at
points xi (t) if and only if u(x, t) has the form
N

u(x, t) = 2
i=1

℘(x − xi (t))

(9.12)

and xi (t) satisfy the equations of motion of the elliptic CM system (9.1).
The assumption that there exist N linear independent double-Bloch solutions with equivalent Bloch multipliers implies that they can be written in the form
N

ψ=
i=1

2

ci (t, k, z)Φ(x − xi (t), z)ekx+k t ,

(9.13)

with the same z but different values of the parameter k.
Let us substitute (9.13) into (9.11). Then (9.11) is satisfied if and only if we get a function
holomorphic in the fundamental domain. First of all, we conclude that u has poles at xi ,
only. The vanishing of the triple poles (x − xi )−3 implies that u(x, t) has the form (9.12).
The vanishing of the double poles (x − xi )−2 gives the equalities that can be written as a
matrix equation for the vector C = (ci ):
(L(t, z) − kI)C = 0 ,
30

(9.14)

where I is the unit matrix and the Lax matrix L(t, z) is defined as follows:
1
Lij (t, z) = − δij x˙ i − (1 − δij )Φ(xi − xj , z).
2

(9.15)

Finally, the vanishing of the simple poles gives the equations
(∂t − M(t, z))C = 0 ,
where



Mij = ℘(z) − 2

j=i

(9.16)



℘(xi − xj ) δij − 2(1 − δij )Φ′ (xi − xj , z).

(9.17)

The existence of N linear independent solutions for (9.11) with equivalent Bloch multipliers
implies that (9.14) and (9.16) have N independent solutions corresponding to different values
of k. Hence, as a compatibility condition we get the Lax equation L˙ = [M, L] which is
equivalent to (9.1). Note that the last system does not depend on z. Therefore, if (9.14)
and (9.16) are compatible for some z, then they are compatible for all z. As a result we
conclude that if (9.11) has N linear independent double-Bloch solutions with equivalent
Bloch multipliers then it has infinitely many of them. All the double-Bloch solutions are
parameterized by points of an algebraic curve Γ defined by the characteristic equation
N

R(k, z) ≡ det(kI − L(z)) = k N +

ri (z)k N −i = 0.

(9.18)

i=1

Equation (9.18) can be seen as a dispersion relation between two Bloch multipliers and
defines Γ as N-sheet cover of Γ0 .
As was shown in [66] expansion of the characteristic equation (9.14) at z = 0 has the
form:
N

R(k, z) =

(k + νi z −1 + hi + O(z)), ν1 = 1 − N, νi = 1, i > 1.

(9.19)

i=1

We call the sheet of Γ at z = 0 corresponding to the branch k = z −1 (N − 1) + O(1), an
upper sheet and mark the point P1 on this sheet among the preimages of z = 0. From (9.19)
it follows that in general position when the curve Γ is smooth, its genus equals N.
Further consideration of analytical properties of the function ψ given by (9.13) where
ci are components of the eigenvector to the matrix L shows that this function is just the
Baker-Akhiezer function introduced in Section 6. Combined with expression (6.22) for ψ in
terms of θ-function this result directly leads to the main statement of [66]:
the coordinates of the particles xi (t) are roots of the equation
θ(Ux + V t + Z0 ) = 0,

(9.20)

where θ(ξ) = θ(ξ|B) is the Riemann theta-function corresponding to the matrix of b-periods
of holomorphic differentials on Γ; the vectors U and V are the vectors of b-periods of normalized meromorphic differentials on Γ, with poles of order 2 and 3 at the point P1 .
31

Among other examples of integrable systems that can be generated in the similar way
are Ruijesenaars-Schneider system [86]
x¨i =
s=i

x˙ i x˙ s (V (xi − xs ) − V (xs − xi )), V (x) = ζ(x) − ζ(x + η),

(9.22)

As shown in [68, 69], they are generated by spectral problems for equations
Lψ = ∂t ψ(x, t) − ψ(x + η, t) − v(x, t)ψ(x, t) = 0,

(9.23)

ψ(x, m + 1) = ψ(x + η) + v(x, m)ψ(x, m),

(9.24)

and
respectively. (Here η is a complex number and v(x, t) is an elliptic function.)
Strange as it is, the inverse spectral problem which is discussed here is simplier for twodimensional operators then for one-dimensional stationary operators. For example a family
of spectral curves corresponding to operators (9.11) that have double-Bloch solutions can be
described explicitly. A nice formula was found in [79]:
R(k, z) = f (k − ζ(z), z), f (k, z) =

∂
1
H(k),
σ z+
σ(z)
∂k

(9.25)

where H(k) is a polynomial. Note that (9.25) may be written as:
f (k, z) =

1
σ(z)

N

1 n
∂
∂z σ(z)
∂k
n=1 n!

n

H(k).

The coefficients of the polynomial H(k) are free parameters of the spectral curve of the CM
system.
The spectral curves corresponding to the Schr¨odinger operator with the same property
are special case of the curves (9.25) but their explicit description is unknown. In particular,
exact formula for branching points for Lame potentials is unknown. As it was mentioned
above the first example of elliptic finite-gap potentials different from the Lame potentials
was found in [25]. A wide class of such potentials was found in [70].
In [88] it was noted that the problem of classification of Schr¨odinger operators with elliptic
potentials that have two double-Bloch solutions for almost all energy levels was posed by
Picard though had not been solved until very recently. In [88] using Floquet spectral theory
for the Schr¨odinger operator it was proved that all such potentials are finite-gap. This result
is an essential step in the Picard problem though its complete and effective solution is still
an open problem.
