Evidence for a New State of Matter:
An Assessment of the Results from the CERN Lead Beam Programme

The year 1994 marked the beginning of the CERN lead beam programme. A
beam of 33 TeV (or 160 GeV per nucleon) lead ions from the SPS now extends
the CERN relativistic heavy ion programme, started in the mid eighties, to the
heaviest naturally occurring nuclei. A run with lead beam of 40 GeV per nucleon
in fall of 1999 complemented the program towards lower energies. Seven large experiments participate in the lead beam program, measuring many different aspects
of lead-lead and lead-gold collision events: NA44, NA45/CERES, NA49, NA50,
NA52/NEWMASS, WA97/NA57, and WA98. Some of these experiments use multipurpose detectors to measure simultaneously and correlate several of the more
abundant observables. Others are dedicated experiments to detect rare signatures
with high statistics. This coordinated effort using several complementing experiments has proven very successful. The present document summarizes the most
important results from this program at the dawn of the RHIC era: soon the relativistic heavy ion collider at BNL will allow to study gold-gold collisions at 10 times
higher collision energies.
Physicists have long thought that a new state of matter could be reached if the
short range repulsive forces between nucleons could be overcome and if squeezed
nucleons would merge into one another. Present theoretical ideas provide a more
precise picture for this new state of matter: it should be a quark-gluon plasma
(QGP), in which quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of matter, are
no longer confined within the dimensions of the nucleon, but free to move around
over a volume in which a high enough temperature and/or density prevails. This
plasma also exhibits the so-called “chiral symmetry” which in normal nuclear matter
is spontaneously broken, resulting in effective quark masses which are much larger
than the actual masses. For the transition temperature to this new state, lattice
QCD calculations give values between 140 and 180 MeV, corresponding to an energy
density in the neighborhood of 1 GeV/fm3 , or seven times that of nuclear matter.
Temperatures and energy densities above these values existed in the early universe
during the first few microseconds after the Big Bang.
It has been expected that in high energy collisions between heavy nuclei sufficiently high energy densities could be reached such that this new state of matter
would be formed. Quarks and gluons would then freely roam within the volume of
the fireball created by the collision. The individual quark and gluon energies would
1

be typical of a system at very high temperature (above 200 MeV) even if the system should not have enough time to fully thermalize. Positive identification of the
quark-gluon plasma state in relativistic heavy ion collisions is, however, extremely
difficult. If created, the QGP state would have only a very transient existence.
Due to color confinement, a well-known property of strong interactions at low energies, single quarks and gluons cannot escape from the collision – they must always
combine to color-neutral hadrons before being able to travel to the detector. This
process is called “hadronization”. Thus, regardless of whether or not QGP is formed
in the initial stage, the collision fireball later turns into a system of hadrons. In a
head-on lead-lead collision at the SPS about 2500 particles are created (NA49) of
which more than 99.9% are hadrons. Evidence for or against formation of an initial
state of deconfined quarks and gluons at the SPS thus must be extracted from a
careful and quantitative analysis of the observed final state.
A common assessment of the collected data leads us to conclude that
we now have compelling evidence that a new state of matter has indeed
been created, at energy densities which had never been reached over
appreciable volumes in laboratory experiments before and which exceed
by more than a factor 20 that of normal nuclear matter. The new state
of matter found in heavy ion collisions at the SPS features many of the
characteristics of the theoretically predicted quark-gluon plasma.
The evidence for this new state of matter is based on a multitude of different
observations. Many hadronic observables show a strong nonlinear dependence on
the number of nucleons which participate in the collision. Models based on hadronic
interaction mechanisms have consistently failed to simultaneously explain the wealth
of accumulated data. On the other hand, the data exhibit many of the predicted
signatures for a quark-gluon plasma. Even if a full characterization of the initial
collision stage is presently not yet possible, the data provide strong evidence that it
consists of deconfined quarks and gluons.
We emphasize that the evidence collected so far is “indirect” since it stems from
the measurement of particles which have undergone significant reinteractions between the early collision stages and their final observation. Still, they retain enough
memory of the initial quark-gluon state to provide evidence for its formation, like
the grin of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland which remains even after the cat
has disappeared. It is expected that the present “proof by circumstantial evidence”
for the existence of a quark-gluon plasma in high energy heavy ion collisions will
be further substantiated by more direct measurements (e.g. electromagnetic signals
which are emitted directly from the quarks in the QGP) which will become possible
at the much higher collision energies and fireball temperatures provided by RHIC
at Brookhaven and later the LHC at CERN.
In the following the most important experimental findings and their interpretation are described in more detail:

2

Hadrons are strongly interacting particles. In nuclear collisions, after being first
created, they undergo many secondary interactions before escaping from the collision
“fireball”. When they are finally set free, the fireball volume has expanded by about
a factor 30–50; this information can be extracted from two-particle correlations between identical hadrons by a method called “Bose-Einstein interferometry” (NA44,
NA49, WA98). At this point, the relative abundances and momentum distributions
of the hadrons still contain important memories of the dense early collision stage
which can be extracted by a comprehensive analysis of the hadronic final state. More
than 20 different hadron species, including a few small anti-nuclei (anti-deuteron,
anti-helium), have been measured by the seven experiments (NA44, NA45, NA49,
NA50, NA52, WA97, WA98). A combined analysis of their momentum distributions
and two-particle correlations shows that, at the point where they stop interacting
and “freeze out”, the fireball is in a state of tremendous explosion, with expansion
velocities exceeding half the speed of light, and very close to local thermal equilibrium at a temperature of about 100-120 MeV. This characteristic feature gave rise
to the name “Little Bang”. The observed explosion calls for strong pressure in the
earlier collision stages. Recently measured anisotropies in the angular distribution
of the momenta perpendicular to the beam direction (NA49, NA45, WA98) indicate
that the pressure was built up quickly, pointing to intense rescattering in the early
collision stages.
An earlier glimpse of the expanding system is provided by a measurement of
correlated electron-positron pairs, also called dileptons (NA45). These data show
that in sulphur-gold and lead-gold collisions the expected peak from the rho (ρ)
vector meson (a particle which can decay into dileptons even before freeze-out) is
completely smeared out. Simultaneously, NA45 finds in lead-gold collisions an excess
of dileptons in the mass region between 250 and 700 MeV, by about a factor 3 above
expectations from hadron decays scaled from proton-nucleon to lead-gold collisions.
Theory explains this by a broadening of the ρ’s spectral function, resulting from
scattering among pions and nucleons in a very dense hadronic fireball, just below
the critical energy density for quark-gluon plasma formation. The ρ meson mixes
with its partner under chiral symmetry transformations, signalling the onset of chiral
symmetry restoration as matter becomes denser and denser.
The theoretical analysis of the measured hadron abundances (NA44, NA45,
NA49, NA50, NA52, WA97, WA98) shows that they reflect a state of “chemical
equilibrium” at a temperature of about 170 MeV. This points to an even earlier
stage of the collision. In fact, such temperatures (corresponding to an energy density of about 1 GeV/fm3 ) are the highest allowed ones before, according to lattice
QCD, hadrons should dissolve into quarks and gluons. The observations are explained by assuming that at this temperature the hadrons were formed by a statistical hadronization process from a pre-existing quark-gluon system. Theoretical
studies showed that at CERN energies subsequent interactions among the hadrons,
while causing pressure and driving the expansion and cooling of the fireball, are
very ineffective in changing the abundance ratios. This is why, after accounting for
3

the decay of unstable resonances, the finally measured hadron yields reflects rather
accurately the conditions at the quark-hadron transition.
A particularly striking aspect of this apparent “chemical equilibrium” at the
quark-hadron transition temperature is the observed enhancement, relative to proton-induced collisions, of hadrons containing strange quarks. Globally, when normalized to the number of participating nucleons, this enhancement corresponds to a
factor 2 (NA49), but hadrons containing more than one strange quark are enhanced
much more strongly (WA97, NA49, NA50), up to a factor 15 for the Omega (Ω) hyperon and its antiparticle (WA97)! Lead-lead collisions are thus qualitatively different from a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. That the relative
enhancement is found to increase with the strange quark content of the produced
hadrons contradicts predictions from hadronic rescattering models where secondary
production of multi-strange (anti)baryons is hindered by high mass thresholds and
low cross sections. Since the hadron abundances appear to be frozen in at the point of
hadron formation, this enhancement signals a new and faster strangeness-producing
process before or during hadronization, involving intense rescattering among quarks
and gluons. This effect was predicted about 20 years ago as a quark-gluon plasma
signature, resulting from a combination of large gluon densities and a small strange
quark mass in this color deconfined, chirally symmetric state. Experimentally it
is found not only in lead-lead collisions, but even in central sulphur-nucleus collisions, with target nuclei ranging from sulphur to lead (NA35, WA85, WA94). This
is consistent with estimates of initial energy densities above the critical value of 1
GeV/fm3 even in those collisions.
Evidence for the formation of a transient quark-gluon phase without color confinement is further provided by the observed suppression of the charmonium states
J/ψ, χc , and ψ ′ (NA50). These particles contain charmed quarks and antiquarks (c
and c¯) which are so heavy that they can only be produced at the very beginning
when the constituents of the colliding nuclei still have their full energy. As one varies
the size of the colliding nuclei and the centrality of the collision one finds, after subtracting the expected absorption effects from final state interactions between the c¯
c
pair and the nucleons of the interpenetrating nuclei, a succession of suppression patterns: The most weakly bound state, ψ ′ , is suppressed already in sulphur-uranium
collisions (NA38), the intermediate χc seems to disappear quite suddenly in semicentral lead-lead collisions, and in the most central lead-lead collisions an additional
reduction of the J/ψ yield indicates that now also the strongly bound J/ψ ground
state itself is significantly suppressed (NA50). The observation of χc suppression is
indirect, via its 30-40% contribution to the measured J/ψ yield which is expected
from scaling proton-proton measurements. Charmonium suppression was predicted
15 years ago as a consequence of color screening in a quark-gluon plasma which
should keep the charmed quark-antiquark pairs from binding to each other. According to this prediction, suppressing the J/ψ requires temperatures which are
about 30% above the color deconfinement temperature, or energy densities of about
3 GeV/fm3 . This agrees with estimates of the initial energy densities reached in
4

central lead-lead collisions, based on calorimetry or on a back-extrapolation from
the freeze-out stage to the timei before expansion started. It was tried to reproduce
the data by assuming that the charmonia are destroyed solely by final state interactions with surrounding hadrons; none of these attempts can account for the shape
of the centrality dependence of the observed suppression. On the other hand, the
interpretation of this pattern in terms of color screening by deconfined quarks and
gluons leads to the prediction of a similar suppression pattern at RHIC in much
smaller nuclei; this prediction will soon be tested.
In spite of its many facets the resulting picture is simple: the two colliding nuclei
deposit energy into the reaction zone which materializes in the form of quarks and
gluons which strongly interact with each other. This early, very dense state (energy
density about 3–4 GeV/fm3 , mean particle momenta corresponding to T ≈ 240 MeV)
suppresses the formation of charmonia, enhances strangeness and begins to drive the
expansion of the fireball. Subsequently, the “plasma” cools down and becomes more
dilute. At an energy density of 1 GeV/fm3 (T ≈ 170 MeV) the quarks and gluons
hadronize and the final hadron abundances are fixed. At an energy density of order 50
MeV/fm3 (T = 100–120 MeV) the hadrons stop interacting, and the fireball freezes out.
At this point it expands with more than half the light velocity.
This does not happen only in a few “special” collision events, but essentially
in every lead-lead collision: characteristic observables, like the average transverse
momentum of produced particles or the kaon/pion ratio, show only the statistically
expected fluctuations in a thermalized ensemble, around average values which are
the same in all collisions (NA49). Since the kaon/pion ratio is essentially fixed
at the point of hadronization, this indicates the absence of long-range correlations
like those expected in a fully-developed thermodynamic phase transition. A better
theoretical understanding of the phase-transition dynamics might emerge from these
observations. The short-range character suggests similarities with the transition
found in high-Tc superconductivity.
“Direct” observation of the quark-gluon plasma may be possible via electromagnetic radiation emitted by the quarks during the hot initial stage. Searches for this
radiation were performed at the SPS (WA98, NA45, NA50) but are difficult due to
high backgrounds from other sources. For sulphur-gold collisions WA80 and NA45
established that not more than 5% of the observed photons are emitted directly. For
lead-lead collisions WA98 have reported indications for a significant direct photon
contribution. Preliminary data from NA45 are consistent with this finding, but so
far not statistically significant. NA50 has seen an excess by about a factor 2 in
the dimuon spectrum in the mass region between the φ and J/ψ vector mesons.
The predicted electromagnetic radiation rates at the above mentioned temperatures
are marginal for detection. While under these conditions it is a great experimental
achievement to have obtained positive evidence for a signal, its connection with the
predicted “thermal plasma radiation” is not yet firmly established.
This is expected to change at the higher collision energies provided by RHIC and
5

LHC. The much higher initial temperatures (up to nearly 1000 MeV for lead-lead
collisions at the LHC have been predicted) and longer plasma lifetimes should facilitate the direct observation of the plasma radiation and lead to the production of
additional heavy charm quarks by gluon-gluon scattering in the QGP phase. The
much higher initial energy densities which can be reached at RHIC and LHC give us
more time until the quarks and gluons rehadronize, thus allowing for a quantitative
characterization of the quark-gluon plasma and detailed studies of its early tharmalization processes and dynamical evolution. Finally, the higher collision energies
allow for the production of jets with large transverse momenta, whose leading quarks
can be used as “hard penetrating probes” within the quark-gluon plasma. At RHIC
a set of four large detectors, with complementary goals and capabilities, ensures
that all experimental aspects of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions are optimally
covered. The ability of the collider to simultaneously accelerate and collide nuclei of
different sizes and energies promises a complete understanding of systematic trends
as one proceeds from proton-proton via proton-nucleus to gold-gold collisions. As in
solid state physics, where the knowledge of the basic interaction Lagrangian (QED)
does not permit to reliably predict many bulk properties and where the detailed
understanding of the latter is usually driven by experiment, we expect that such
a systematic experimental study of strongly interacting matter will eventually lead
to a quantitative understanding of “bulk QCD”. We are looking forward to these
far-reaching opportunities provided by RHIC and LHC.
