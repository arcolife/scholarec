Osterwalder–Schrader axioms—Wightman Axioms—The mathematical
axiom systems for quantum field theory (QFT) grew out of Hilbert’s sixth problem
[6], that of stating the problems of quantum theory in precise mathematical terms.
There have been several competing mathematical systems of axioms, and here we
shall deal with those of A.S. Wightman [5] and of K. Osterwalder and R. Schrader
[4], stated in historical order. They are centered around group symmetry, relative
to unitary representations of Lie groups in Hilbert space. We also mention how the
Osterwalder–Schrader axioms have influenced the theory of unitary representations
of groups, making connection with [3]. Wightman’s axioms involve: (1) a unitary
representation U of G := SL (2, C) ⋊ R4 as a cover of the Poincar´e group of relativity, and a vacuum state vector ψ0 fixed by the representation, (2) quantum fields
ϕ1 (f ) , . . . , ϕn (f ), say, as operator-valued distributions, f running over a specified
space of test functions, and the operators ϕi (f ) defined on a dense and invariant
domain D in H (the Hilbert space of quantum states), and ψ0 ∈ D, (3) a transformation law which states that U (g) ϕj (f ) U g −1 is a finite-dimensional representation R of the group G acting on the fields ϕi (f ), i.e., i Rji g −1 ϕi (g [f ]),
g acting on space-time and g [f ] (x) = f g −1 x , x ∈ R4 . (4) The fields ϕj (f ) are
assumed to satisfy locality and one of the two canonical commutation relations of
[A, B]± = AB ± BA, for fermions, resp., bosons; and (5) it is assumed that there
is scattering with asymptotic completeness, in the sense H = Hin = Hout .
The Wightman axioms were the basis for many of the spectacular developments
in QFT in the seventies, see, e.g., [1, 2], and the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms [3, 4]
came in response to the dictates of path space measures. The constructive approach
involved some variant of the Feynman measure. But the latter has mathematical divergences that can be resolved with an analytic continuation so that the mathematically well-defined Wiener measure becomes instead the basis for the analysis. Two
analytical continuations were suggested
√ in this connection: in the mass-parameter,
and in the time-parameter, i.e., t → −1t. With the latter, the Newtonian quadratic form on space-time turns into the form of relativity, x21 + x22 + x23 − t2 . We get
a stochastic process Xt : symmetric, i.e., Xt ∼ X−t ; stationary, i.e., Xt+s ∼ Xs ;
and Osterwalder–Schrader positive, i.e., Ω f1 ◦ Xt1 f2 ◦ Xt2 · · · fn ◦ Xtn dP ≥ 0,
f1 , . . . , fn test functions, −∞ < t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tn < ∞, and P denoting a path
space measure.
Specifically: If −t/2 < t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tn < t/2, then

By Minlos’ theorem, there is a measure µ on D′ such that

eiq(f ) dµt (q) =

for all f ∈ D. Since µ is a positive measure, we have

for all c1 , . . . , cn ∈ C, and all f1 , . . . , fn ∈ D. When combining (1) and (2), we
note that this limit-measure µ then accounts for the time-ordered n-point functions

which occur on the left-hand side in formula (1). This observation is further used
in the analysis of the stochastic process Xt , Xt (q) = q (t). But, more importantly,
it can be checked from the construction that we also have the following reflection
positivity: Let (θf ) (s) := f (−s), f ∈ D, s ∈ R, and set
D+ = {f ∈ D | f real valued, f (s) = 0 for s < 0} .
Then
k

c¯k cl S (θ (fk ) − fl ) ≥ 0

for all c1 , . . . , cn ∈ C, and all f1 , . . . , fn ∈ D+ , which is one version of Osterwalder–
Schrader positivity.
Since the Killing form of Lie theory may serve as a finite-dimensional metric, the
Osterwalder–Schrader idea [4] turned out also to have implications for the theory
of unitary representations of Lie groups. In [3], the authors associate to Riemannian symmetric spaces G/K of tube domain type, a duality between complementary
series representations of G on one side, and highest weight representations of a
c
c-dual Gc on the other side. The duality
√ G ↔ G involves analytic continuation, in a sense which generalizes t → −1t, and the reflection positivity of the
Osterwalder–Schrader axiom system. What results is a new Hilbert space where
the new representation of Gc is “physical” in the sense that there is positive energy
and causality, the latter concept being defined from certain cones in the Lie algebra
of G.
A unitary representation π acting on a Hilbert space H(π) is said to be reflection
symmetric if there is a unitary operator J : H(π) → H(π) such that
R1) J 2 = id.

g ∈ G,

R2) Jπ(g) = π(τ (g))J ,

where τ ∈ Aut (G), τ = id, and H := {g ∈ G | τ (g) = g}.
A closed convex cone C ⊂ q is hyperbolic if C o = ∅ and if ad X is semisimple
with real eigenvalues for every X ∈ C o .
Assume the following for (G, π, τ, J):
PR1) π is reflection symmetric with reflection J.
PR2) There is an H-invariant hyperbolic cone C ⊂ q such that S(C) = H exp C
is a closed semigroup and S(C)o = H exp C o is diffeomorphic to H × C o .

PR3) There is a subspace 0 = K0 ⊂ H(π) invariant under S(C) satisfying the
positivity condition
v v

J

:= v J(v) ≥ 0,

∀v ∈ K0 .

Assume that (π, C, H, J) satisfies (PR1)–(PR3). Then the following hold:
1) S(C) acts via s → π
˜ (s) by contractions on K (= the Hilbert space obtained
by completion of K0 in the norm from (PR3)).
2) Let Gc be the simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gc . Then there
exists a unitary representation π
˜ c of Gc such that d˜
π c (X) = d˜
π (X) for
c
X ∈ h and i d˜
π (Y ) = d˜
π (iY ) for Y ∈ C, where h := {X ∈ g | τ (X) = X}.
3) The representation π
˜ c is irreducible if and only if π
˜ is irreducible.
