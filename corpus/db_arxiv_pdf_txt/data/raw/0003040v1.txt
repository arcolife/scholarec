i.e., the TF energy and density is obtained by minimizing E(ρ) with ρ ∈ L5/3 (R3 ) and ρ = N . The
Euler-Lagrange equation, called the Thomas-Fermi
equation, is

THOMAS-FERMI THEORY – Sometimes
called the ‘statistical theory’, it was invented by
L. H. Thomas[TH] and E. Fermi[EF], shortly after
Schr¨odinger invented his quantum-mechanical wave
equation, in order to approximately describe the electron density, ρ(x), x ∈ R3 , and the ground state
energy, E(N ) for a large atom or molecule with a
large number, N , of electrons. Schr¨odinger’s equation, which would give the exact density and energy,
cannot be easily handled when N is large.
A starting point for the theory is the TF energy
functional. For a molecule with K nuclei of charges
Zi > 0 and locations Ri ∈ R3 (i = 1, ..., K), it is

γρ(x)2/3 = [Φ(x) − µ]+ ,

where [a]+ = max{0, a}, µ is some constant (Lagrange
multiplier) and Φ is the TF potential:

The following essential mathematical facts about the
TF equation were established by E.H. Lieb and B.
Simon [LS] (cf. the review article [EL]).
1. There is a density ρTF
N that minimizes E(ρ) if and
K
only if N ≤ Z := j=1 Zj . This ρTF
N is unique
and it satisfies the TF equation (2) for some µ ≥
0. Every positive solution, ρ, of (2) is a minimizer
of (1) for N = ρ. If N > Z then E TF (N ) =
E TF (Z) and any minimizing sequence converges
weakly in L5/3 (R3 ) to ρTF
Z .

and γ = (3π 2 )2/3 . The constraint on ρ is ρ(x) ≥ 0
and R3 ρ = N . The functional ρ → E(ρ) is convex.

The justification for this functional is this:

produce an electron density ρ.
E TF (N ) is a strictly convex, decreasing function

The TF energy is defined to be

which is the form in which the TF equation is usually
stated (but it is valid only for N = Z).

Thus, a large atom (i.e., large Z) is smaller than a
Z = 1 atom by a factor Z −1/3 in radius. Despite
this seeming paradox, TF theory gives the correct
electron density in a real atom — so far as the bulk
of the electrons is concerned — as Z → ∞
Another important fact is the large |x| asymptotics
of ρTF

An important property of the solution is Teller’s
theorem [ET] (proved rigorously in [LS]) which implies that the TF molecule is always unstable, i.e.,
for each N ≤ Z there are K numbers Nj ∈ (0, Zj )
with j Nj = N such that

is crucial for this result. The inequality is strict. Not
only does E TF decrease when the nuclei are pulled
infinitely far apart (which is what (4) says) but any
dilation of the nuclear coordinates (Rj → ℓRj , ℓ > 1)
will decrease E TF in the neutral case (positivity of
the pressure) [EL], [BL]. This theorem plays an important role in the stability of matter.
An important question concerns the connection between E TF (N ) and E Q (N ), the ground state energy

independent of Z. Again, this behavior agrees with
quantum mechanics — on a length scale Z −1/3 , which
is where the bulk of the electrons are to be found.
In light of the limit theorem (5), Teller’s theorem
can be understood as saying that as Z → ∞ the
quantum mechanical binding energy of a molecule is
of lower order in Z than the total ground state energy.
Thus, Teller’s theorem is not a defect of TF theory
(although it is sometimes interpreted that way) but
an important statement about the true quantum mechanical situation.
For finite Z one can show, using the Lieb-Thirring
