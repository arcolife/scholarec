variables.

Introduction

Properties of solutions and process of integration for the KadomtsevPetviashvili equation (KP) [1]:
∂x (∂t u + 6u∂x u + ∂x3 u) = −3σ 2 ∂y2 u

(1)

depend on sign of σ 2 . This equation is called KP-2 if σ 2 = 1.
In this work the asymptotic behaviour of decreasing solution of
equation KP-2 is obtained as t → ∞. The main term of the asymptotics has an order by O(t−1 ) and fast oscillates. An envelope of these
oscillations depends on ξ = x/t and η = y/t. Results of the work
are formulated in terms of scattering data for auxiliary linear problem, which is associated with equation KP-2 in the inverse scattering
transform (IST) [2, 3].

The equation KP plays important role in modern mathematical
physics. Many applications of these equation are known in plasma
physics, water waves and other fields of waves process [4]. Therefore questions about solvability of this equation in different functional
classes were studied in detail. In particular, the existence of global solution of Cauchy problem in class of distribution functions was proved
in [5]. A norm of solution in Sobolev space was estimated and an
asymptotics of a solution were obtained as t → ∞ for KP-like equation but with more high nonlinearity, which called generalized equation KP, in [6].
The IST formalism allows to reduce a constructing of the solution
of nonlinear integrable equation into solving of linear problems. One of
most important achievements of IST is the constructing of asymptotic
behaviours of solutions as t → ∞. These results are well-known for
1+1-dimensional equations (one spatial and one temporal variable)
[7]-[13]. Asymptotic behaviours of solutions for (2+1)-dimensional
equations were studied not so in detail. Rigorous results about temporal asymptotics of solutions, which is nonuniform with respect to
spatial variables, for a special class of nondecreasing solutions were obtained in [14], [15]. In work [16] an formal asymptotics of decreasing
solution of equation KP-1, which is nonuniform with respect to spatial variables, was constructed. Results about asymptotic behaviour
of decreasing solutions of equation KP-2 as t → ∞ and about a remainder of this asymptotics, which are uniform with respect to spatial
variables, are obtained in present work.
The formalism IST for solving of Cauchy problem for equation
KP-2 was presented in [17]. This formalism will be used in this work.
Below we remind basic steps of solving of Cauchy problem for equation
KP-2 by IST.
Let us denote an initial condition for equation KP-2 as:
u|t=0 = u0 (x, y).

(2)

The process of solving of the Cauchy problem (1), (2) consists of
several steps.
First step is solving direct scattering problem. On this step a
boundary problem is solved for function ϕ:
− ∂y ϕ + ∂x2 ϕ + 2ik∂x ϕ + uϕ = 0,

ϕ||k|→∞ = 1,

and scattering data are constructed by a formula:
F (k) =

sgn(−Re(k))
2π

R2 dx dy u0 (x, y)ϕ(x, y, k, 0) ×

(3)

¯ − (k2 − k¯2 )y).
× exp(−i(k + k)x

(4)

It is useful to note, if u is real, then the function F (k) has property
¯ = −F¯ (k). This follows from formulas (3) and (4).
F (−k)
On the next step an evolution of scattering data is determined.
This evolution is very simple:
F(k; t) = F (k) exp(4it(k3 + k¯3 )).
Third step is solving of inverse scattering problem. This is reduced
¯
to so-called D-problem:
¯ exp(itS),
∂k¯ ϕ = ψ F (−k)
∂k ψ = −ϕ F (k) exp(−itS);

¯ − i(k2 − k¯2 )η, ξ = x/t, η = y/t, the
where S = 4(k3 + k¯3 ) + (k + k)ξ
function F (k) is nonanalytic with respect to complex variable k ∈ C.
Solving of this problem allows to obtain the functions ϕ and ψ at any
time, if we know the evolution of scattering data.
At last we can obtain the solution of the Cauchy problem by using
the formula [17]:
u(x, y, t) = ∂x

C

dk ∧ dk¯ F (k)ψ(k, x, y, t) exp(itS).

(6)

However, this successive method of solving for Cauchy problems
for general initial conditions allows to obtain very implicit answer
with respect to initial data. Therefore the problem (5) and integral
(6) are used usually for solving of integrable nonlinear equations and
the scattering data is taking from some suitable functional class (see,
for example, [14]-[16]). On one-hand side this gives for studying a
functional class of solutions, but on the other hand-side this leads to
implicit restrictions on class of initial conditions.
The auxiliary linear problem (3) and some related problems were
studied in [18]-[23]. In the work [23] it was proved that if the function
u0 (x, y) decreases exponentially, then the direct scattering problem
(3) is solvable for ∀k ∈ C.
To construct the asymptotics of u as t → ∞ we use the asymptotics
of ψ and evaluate an asymptotics of the integral (6) by stationary
phase method [24]. As it turned out, the main term of asymptotics
of the function u may be defined by using only the main term of
an asymptotic expansion of ψ as t → ∞. Taking into account the

3

fast oscillating coefficients of the system from (5) one can guess, that
ψ = 1 + o(1) as t → ∞. But we cannot say something definitely about
the asymptotic behaviour of the function u, until we do not know
analytic properties and an order of the remainder of asymptotics of ψ
more precisely. Thus we come to studying an asymptotic behaviour
¯
of a solution of the D-problem
(5).
¯
The asymptotic behaviour of the solution of the D-problem
as
t → ∞ with continuous and fast oscillated coefficients was obtained in
¯
[25]. Here we study the D-problem
with discontinuous coefficients on
imaginary axis of complex parameter k. Constructing of the asymptotics of solution for such problem is more complicated. Not only
stationary points of phase function of an oscillated exponent define a
structure of the asymptotic solution for (5) as in [25] (see also [26]),
but the location of these stationary points with respect to line of discontinuity of coefficients of the equations (5) as well. It contributes
additional difficulties into evaluating and leads to changes in results.
The uniform asymptotics of the solution of the problem (5) is constructed by matching method [27].

3 An analytic behaviours of the scattering data
In this section we demonstrate analytic behaviour of the scattering
data which corresponds to sufficiently smooth and decreasing initial
condition (2).
First of all we show, that the solution of (5) exists.
Theorem 2 Let F (k) be such, that the condition (7) is fulfilled, then
the solution of (5) exists in a space of continuous vector-functions
bounded when k ∈ C.
Proof. Let us consider a system of integral equations which is
equivalent to (5):

Using well-known results about integral operators (see, for example
[29]) one can show that the operator G[F ] transforms the space of
continuous vector-functions into itself.
The operator G[F ] is contracting operator. It is follows from inequality (7). Hence we obtain the theorem statement.
To construct the asymptotics we must study smoothness of scattering data F (k) in neighborhood of line of discontinuity Re(k) = 0.
Lemma 1 Let u0 (x, y) be a finite function, then in neighborhood of
some point k′ ∈ C the scattering data have to be represented in the
form:
2

F (k) = sgn[Re(−k)]
|α|=0

fα1 α2 (k′ )(k − k′ )α1 (k − k′ )α2 + O(|k − k′ |3 ),

where fα1 ,α2 (k′ ) are continuous functions, when Re(k′ ) = 0 and

The functions F (−m)
¯ and ψ(x, y, m) are smooth on the left and righthand sides of complex plane of m and one can show that the integral
exists. Let us represent it into more convenient form. For this we
rewrite the integral into sum of two integrals over left-hand side and
right-hand side of complex plane. Let us integrate by parts these
integrals. As a result we obtain
∂k ϕ =

Here Ω± is right-hand side (+) and left-hand side (-) of complex plane.
We mean the integral over ∂Ω+ as sum of integral over right-hand side
and left-hand side of the circle with center at origin of coordinates and
with large radius (which tends into infinity) and of improper integral
over imaginary line and of an integral over the circle with small radius
ε with center at k = m. The direction of the integration over ∂Ω+ is
determined by standard way.
Consider the sum of the integrals over ∂Ω± . Each of the integrals
over large half-circles is equal to zero as R → ∞ because the integrand
decreases. The sum of the integrals over the imaginary axis gives
doubled integral over the imaginary axis in positive direction. The
integral over small circle equals zero as ε → 0.
Let us evaluate the derivative ∂m f (−m)
¯ of the integrand of the
¯ 0),
double integrals. For this we note that ϕ(x, y, k, 0) = ψ(x, y, −k,
hence f (−m)
¯ has to be represented by the function ψ(x, y, m, 0) and
then:
∂m f (−m)

So we obtain a formula f10 (k′ ):

The asymptotic solution of the problem (8) is combined. Here
we construct the asymptotics as t → ∞ uniformly with respect to
¯ ξ, η)
all parameters. The stationary points of the functions S(k, k,
with respect to parameters k, k¯ plays the important role in these
constructions.
The asymptotic expansion of the solutions is constructed using
the inverse powers of large parameter t as a asymptotic sequence of
asymptotic expansion outside of small neighborhoods of the stationary
points of the function. Near the stationary points the asymptotic
sequence has the form t−n/2 , where n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Following the
terminology of matching method [27], we call the asymptotics outside
of small neighborhoods of stationary points by outer expansion and we
call by interior expansion the asymptotics near the stationary points .
The right-hand side in the system of equations (8) is discontinuous on
the line Re(k) = 0, therefore the asymptotic solution is differentiable
out of the line Re(k) = 0.
The domains of validity for interior and exterior asymptotic expansions are intersected. This fact is used by matching method in
order to construct unique combined asymptotic expansions.
The phase function S depends on two parameters (ξ, η) ∈ R2 . On
the curve 12ξ + η 2 = 0 the confluence of two stationary points of the
function S occurs. In this case we have one confluent stationary point.
The structure of the asymptotic expansion of solution of (8) is changed
here. As |12ξ + η 2 | ≪ 1 the expansion is constructed on the powers of
t−n/3 , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . as a asymptotic sequence.
The formulas for the uniform asymptotic expansions of the solution
of (8) are large and it seems convenient to formulate the results about
general case in section 4.1 and about confluence case in section 4.2 for
convenience .

4.1

Asymptotics in a general case

In this section the combined asymptotic solution of (8) is constructed
when the phase function S has nondegenerate stationary points k = k1
and k = k2 . Here we suppose that ∀k ∈ C, t1/3 |∂k2 S|k=k1,2 | ≫ 1 as

9

t → ∞. This leads to restriction on values of the parameters ξ and
η, namely, t1/3 |12ξ + η 2 | ≫ 1. The asymptotic expansion which is
uniform with respect to k ∈ C is formulated in the end of this section.
To construct the combined asymptotic solution which is valuable as
k ∈ C we obtain exterior and interior asymptotic expansions. These
expansions are valid outside of small neighborhoods of kj , j = 1, 2
and in the small neighborhoods of kj respectively. Denote: θ =
−12ξ − η 2 . Then one can obtain an expressions for the stationary

The stationary points outside of the break line

Consider the case when Re(θ) = 0, i.e. when the stationary points
k1,2 are outside of the discontinuity line Re(k) = 0. Let us formulate
a result of this section about the combined asymptotic solution:
Lemma 2 Let the system of the equations (8) have not the homogeneous solutions, F (k) ∈ C 2 ∩ L1 as Re(k) = 0 and the parameters ξ
and η satisfy the inequality t1/3 |θ|2 ≫ 1, then:

There exists an domain of values of complex parameter k, in which
the external and internal asymptotic expansions of solution for the
problem (8) are valid. In this domain these asymptotic expansions are
equal up to the terms of order o(t−1 ). In the domain, where t1/2 |k −
kj | ≫ 1 and |k − kj | ≤ t−1/4 , the external and internal expansion are
valid. We compute asymptotics of external expansion as k → kj and
internal expansion as |lj | → ∞.

If we substitute (33) into (8) and evaluate a remainder, then we
obtain:
Theorem 3 The formal asymptotic solution of the problem (8) with
respect to mod(O((t|θ|)−1 )), which is uniformly valuable when k ∈ C
and θ 2 t ≫ 1, has the form (33).

4.1.2

The stationary points on the imaginary axis

If Re(θ) = 0, then the stationary point of the phase function S belongs
to the line, where the coefficients of the equation (8) are discontinuous.
In this case constructing of the formal asymptotic solution of problem
(8) differs from the asymptotic solution which was constructed before.
The main result about the combined asymptotic solution is:
Lemma 3 Let the system of equations (8) have no homogeneous solutions, F (k) ∈ C 2 ∩ L1 as Re(k) = 0; the parameters ξ and η are
−t2/3 (12ξ + η 2 ) ≫ 1, then:
when t|θ||k − k1,2 | ≫ 1the formal asymptotic solution of (8) with

the functions α, β 1 , β 1 , β 0 are defined by (36), (37), (40), (46);

1

Y˜ = 1 + t−1 Y (lj , ξ, η),

where the functions Y (lj , ξ, η), Z (lj , ξ, η), Z (lj , ξ, η) are defined by
(48), (47).

The proof. Let us construct the asymptotics. The external expansion is constructed similarly as in 4.1.1. The main difference is that
the stationary points of the function S are on the line of discontinuity
of the coefficients of system (8). It leads to sufficient modifications in
the formulas for asymptotics. Let us find the external expansion in
the form:
1

2

µex = 1 + t−1 α (k, ξ, η) + t−2 α1 (t, ξ, η) exp(itS) + . . . ,

(34)

ν ex = t−1 (β (k, ξ, η) exp(−itS)+ β 0 (k, ξ, η)) + t−2 β exp(−itS) + . . . .
(35)
After substituting of (34) and (35) into the system (8) we equate the
coefficients with identical powers of t and with oscillated and nonoscillated terms correspondingly. As a result we obtain equations for the
coefficients of asymptotic expansions (34) and (35). The obvious formulas are

Theorem 4 The formal asymptotic solution of the problem (8) with
respect to mod(O((t|θ|)−1 )), which is uniform when k ∈ C and
−θ 2 t2/3 ≫ 1, has the form (49).

4.2 Asymptotics in neighborhood of confluent
stationary point
The system of equations in the problem (8) depends on two control
parameters ξ and η. On the parabola 12ξ + η 2 = 0 the degeneracy
of stationary points occurs: k1 = k2 = k0 = iη. For this reason
the asymptotics constructed in section 4.1 is invalid when parameter
1
θ = η 2 + 12ξ is close to zero. For example, the asymptotics of µ as
k → k0 and θ → 0 is discontinuous:
1
|k − k0 |
k − k0
θ¯
µ |k→k0 |θ→0 =
−
×
2
2
12i((k − k0 ) − θ ) θ 12i((k − k0 )2 − θ 2 )
f (−k¯0 )f (k0 ) + o(1).
This shows that we need new scaling of the parameter θ. The scaled
control parameter is:
θ
v = t1/3 √ .
12
The external expansion constructed in sec. 4.1 becomes discontinuous at θ = 0 and the internal expansions constructed in sec. 4.1
become singular at the point θ = 0 and lose their asymptotic properties. Therefore here we must change the internal variable for the
internal asymptotic expansion:
p = t1/3 (k − k0 ).

22

(50)

In this section we construct a formal asymptotic solution of the
problem (8) with respect to mod(O(t−1 )) when |θ| ≪ 1 uniform with
respect to k ∈ C. The result is formulated in the end of this section.
To construct the uniform asymptotic solution we need the external
and internal asymptotics outside and inside a small neighborhood of
the point k0 respectively.
Lemma 4 Let the system of the equations (8)be have no the homogeneous nontrivial solutions, F (k) ∈ C 2 ∩ L1 and the parameters ξ and
η satisfy the inequality |12ξ + η 2 | ≪ 1, then:
when |k − k0 |t1/3 ≫ 1 the formal asymptotic solution of the system (8)
with respect to mod(O(t−2/3 /|k − k0 |) + O(t−1 )) has the form:

the functions M, j = 1, 2 and N , j = 1, 2, 3 are defined by (75), and

Change the variable k into the variable p in the system (8). The
phase function of the exponent is depend on the variable p as:
tS ≡ ω(p) ≡ 4(p3 + p¯3 ) − v 2 (p + p¯),

where v = t1/3 θ/ 12. Substitute (51) and (52) into the system (8),
equate the coefficients with equal power of t. As a result we obtain

In the Appendix the integrals J1 and J1−+ are reduced into double
integrals. By the similar way we may represent the integral J1+− as

the sum of double integrals. Therefore we may represent Ms as sum of
double integrals also. Corresponded formula is very large and we don’t
write it here. But we will use this formula to evaluate an asymptotic

with respect to the parameter p. The boundedness of these integrals
with respect to p when p ∈ C may be obtained by using the asymp2

totic behaviour of the right-hand side terms of the equation for M as
|p| → ∞.

be done by matching of the external and internal expansions.
For matching process we need asymptotic behaviour of the partial

asymptotics is reduced to evaluating of an integrals with weak singularity in the integrand. Evaluating of these integrals is done in the

Theorem 5 The formula (77) gives the asymptotics solution of the
problem (8) with respect to mod(O(t−1 )) as t → ∞. This asymptotic
solution is uniform with respect to k ∈ C and |θ| ≫ 1.

5 Justification of the asymptotics of
¯
the solution of D-problem
In this section we prove that the remainder of the asymptotics has
order by t−4/3 uniformly with respect to k ∈ C and this remainder has
to be differentiable with respect to x. We call by the remainder of the
asymptotics the difference between solution of the problem (8) and
constructed asymptotic solutions (33) when θ 2 t−2/3 ≫ 1, (49) when
−θ 2 t−2/3 ≫ 1 and (77) when |θ| ≪ 1. The differentiability of the
remainder will be important when we will construct an asymptotic
behaviour of solution of the equation KP-2.

the remainder. Denote the remainder in (82) by V . Substitute (82)
into (8). As a result we obtain:

Consider a system of integral equations instead of the problem
(79), (80):
V = G[F ]V + H,
(81)
where G[F ] is the integral operator:
G[F ]V =




.

Using obvious forms of the functions f1,2 one can proof, that
||H|| = O(t−4/3 )
uniformly with respect to ξ, η ∈ R when k ∈ C.
The operator G[F ] is contracting in the space X, therefore the
solution of the integral equation (81) exists in X and is evaluated by
O(t−4/3 ) uniformly with respect to ξ, η ∈ R.

33

Show that the remainder of the asymptotics is differentiable on
x = tξ. Differentiate with respect to x the system of the equation for
the remainder. Denote the derivative of the vector V by χ. Then we
obtain:
χ = G[F ]χ + ∂x G[F ]V + ∂x H.
The terms ∂x G[F ]V + ∂x H may be evaluated by order O(t−4/3 ).
The operator G[F ] is contracting, therefore one can obtain: ||χ|| =
O(t−4/3 ). The theorem is proved.

The proof of the theorem 1. Let us substitute the function
¯ ξ, η, t) into the formula for the solution of the equation KPψ(k, k,
2(6). Differentiate the integrand with respect to x. The main terms
of the integrand are the terms which appear after differentiating of the
exponent. The derivatives with respect to x of others factors of integrand are small because they depend on x slowly. The integrals of such
terms over the plane are evaluated by the order O(t−4/3 ) uniformly
with respect to (x, y) ∈ R. Rewrite the main term of the integral as the
integral over real plane: (κ, λ) ∈ R2 , where κ = Re(k), λ = Im(k).
As a result we obtain:

Thus the main term of the asymptotics of the solution of the
Cauchy problem for the equation KP-2 is given by integral with fast

integral.

A Asymptotic behaviour of double integral with weak singularity of the integrand
Here we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of integrals which are appeared when the asymptotic solution of (8) was studied.

35

Evaluating of the asymptotic behaviour of one-dimensional integrals with weak singular integrand and fast oscillated exponent was
done in [24] p.26 and [28] p.332. The asymptotic behaviour of manydimensional integrals with fast oscillating exponent was studied in
[24], [30]. The asymptotic behaviour of the Cauchy integrals with fast
oscillating exponent in one-dimensional case was studied in [24] and in
many-dimensional case was studied in [31]. The asymptotic behaviour
of the two-dimensional for some integrals over all complex plane with
weak singularity was studied in [25].

A.1 Integrals over half-plane with general stationary point of fast oscillated exponent
Here we study an asymptotic behaviour of an integral:
I=

Ω+

dn ∧ d¯
n
exp(−i(n2 + n
¯ 2 )),
l−n

where |l| → ∞ and the domain Ω+ = {Re(l + l¯ − i(l − ¯l)) > 0}.
Theorem 7 The asymptotic behaviour of the integral I as |p| → ∞
has the form:

I = − ¯ + O(|l|−2 )
2l

where

l ∈ Ω+ ;

l ∈ Ω+ .

The proof. Let us suppose that l ∈ Ω+ . Divide the domain Ω+
+
into three domains: first one is Ω+
1 = {Ω \{[|n| ≤ |l|/2] ∪ [|n − l| <
ε]}}. This domain hasn’t stationary point of phase function of the
exponent and the singularity of the integrand. Second one is Ω+
2 =
{Ω+ \[|n| ≥ |l|/2]}. This domain contains the stationary point of the
phase function. At last, third domain is Ω+
3 = {|n − l| < ε}. This
domain contains the singularity of the integrand.
Let us integrate by parts over Ω+

The boundary of the domain Ω+
1 includes a large half-circle of radius
R as R → ∞, a circle of radius ε over the point l = n, a half-circle
of radius |l|/2 and two segments: [R exp(3iπ/4), |l| exp(3iπ)/2] and
[|l| exp(−iπ/4)/2, R exp(3iπ)].
Consider the integrals over boundary of the domain Ω+
1 . The integral over large half-circle is equals to zero as R → ∞. The integral over half-circle of radius |l|/2 has order |l|−3 (because of oscillations and small value of the integrand). The integral over the circle
at n = l equals to a residue of the integrand multiplied by 2iπ as
ε → 0. The integral over the segments [R exp(3iπ/4), |l| exp(3iπ)/2]
and [|l| exp(−iπ/4)/2, R exp(3iπ)] (let us denote their union by L) is
reduced to the form:

Let us consider the integral over Ω+

Consider the integral over the boundary of the domain ∂Ω+ . This
integral may be considered as a sum of integrals over imaginary axis
Re(r) = 0, over half-circle of radius R as R → ∞, Re(r) > 0 and
over the circle |p − r| = ε as ε → 0 (if p ∈ Ω+ ). We can see that the
integral over the large half-circle tends to zero. As a result we obtain

B Reducing of four-multiply integral

This section is pure technical. Here we show as the four-multiply
integrals have to be reduced into double integrals over half-plane and
all complex plane.

B.1 Four-multiply integral with nondegenerate phase of the exponent.

Finally we obtain:

into sum of double integrals. Denote:
V (n, v 2 ) =

The function V (p, v 2 ) has to be written as:

We can obtain this formula by changing variable in the integrand
ρ = n − r and differentiating the obtained expression of V (n, v 2 ) with
respect to n

Partial differentiating of the double integral over n

Asymptotic behaviour of V (n, v 2 ) as |n| → ∞ was obtained above.
Using this asymptotics for the first part of the formula (87) gives
zero. Second term of the right-hand side of (87) gives the residue of
the integrand at p multiplied by 2iπ. Then we obtain:
