Abstract
Spectral decompositions for the evolution operator on an energy shell in phase space are constructed for the free motion on
compact 2D surfaces of constant negative curvature. Applications
to quantum chaos and in particular to the recently proposed ballistic σ-model are briefly discussed.

Introduction

The dynamics of a Hamiltonian system can either be described in terms of
the trajectories x0 → x(t) = Ut x0 in the phase space, or by specifying the
ˆt ϕ. The
laws of evolution of a function ϕ(x) on the phase space: ϕ → U
ˆ
evolution operator Ut which advances a function along the trajectories is
defined by
ˆt ϕ(x) = ϕ(Ut x) = ϕ(x(t)).
U
Quantum mechanics has a natural relation to the trajectory based
approach through Feynman’s Path Integral. In the semiclassical limit
the path integral can be approximated by the saddle point contributions
(which turn out to be the classical orbits) and leads to the Gutzwiller
trace formula [1] for the Green’s function of the quantum mechanical
Hamiltonian. This is a useful tool for studying such problems as the
quantum energy level correlations but it requires knowledge of the long
periodic orbits in order to obtain the correlations at small energy differences [2, 3]. The situation is particularly bad in chaotic systems, where
the periodic orbits proliferate exponentially with length. In practice some
uncontrolled approximations about correlations of actions for different
periodic orbits are made to get the analytical results.
In contrast, the flow based approach seems suitable for studying the
behavior of chaotic systems at long times when due to the decay of correlations the dynamics becomes trivial. To use this approach in quantum
1

chaos two problems however need to be overcome. First, it is unclear how
to relate the quantum mechanics to the evolution operator since there is
no analogue of the Feynman path integral. Second, one needs to be able
to calculate various properties of the evolution operator which are natuˆt in decaying
rally formulated in terms of the spectral decomposition of U
eigenmodes.
The first problem has recently been addressed in [4, 5] where it has
been conjectured that the (suitably averaged) correlation functions of the
quantum energy levels and/or quantum eigenfunctions can be generated
from an effective action of nonlinear σ-model type involving the Liouville
ˆ = dU
ˆ
operator L
dt t (the so called “ballistic” σ-model). The inspiration
for this approach comes from the well developed theory of weakly disordered metals, where the disorder averaged properties of an ensemble of
macroscopically identical systems are calculated using a similar σ-model
with a diffusion operator instead of the Liouvillian one. (See [6, 7] for a
detailed discussion of the diffusive case).
Our paper is devoted to the second problem. In particular we compute
a generalized spectral decomposition of the evolution operator

For mixing systems the only square integrable eigenfunctions of U
are the constant functions (see Appendix A). The eigenfunctions |λ
entering the spectral decomposition belong to a larger space C ∞ (M )∗
of distributions and can be obtained from the residues of the analytical
ˆ (see section 2).
continuation of matrix elements of the resolvent of L
The procedure was suggested by Ruelle [8] and was successfully used
to study the dynamics of some chaotic maps (see [9, 10, 11, 12]). The
eigenvalues λ entering the spectral decomposition are sometimes called
“Ruelle resonances”. For our model dynamical system the resonances
can be found using the Selberg trace formula to relate the classical and
quantum zeta-functions [13]. This approach however does not provide
the eigenmodes which we compute using the representation theory of
SO(2, 1).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start by outlining
the Ruelle procedure for flows concentrating on criteria for convergence
of the resulting decomposition (section 2). We then introduce geodesic
flows on constant negative curvature surfaces (section 3); summarize the
important facts from the representation theory of SO(2, 1) and proceed
to obtaining the spectral decomposition (section 4, equation (36)). This
decomposition is used to refine approximations of the decay of correlations
for geodesic flows (section 5.1) and relate the evolution of particle density
on the configuration space to the Laplacian operator (section 5.2). To
conclude we discuss the regularization of the Liouvillian operator entering
2

the ballistic σ-model (section 6.2). Some technical details are relegated
to the appendices.

Decompositions of evolution operators for
general mixing systems
Spectral decompositions

Consider a Hamiltonian system on a phase space T ∗ N with coordinates
x = (q, p) where N is a smooth compact manifold parameterised by q and
p is the momentum. When the Hamiltonian H does not depend on time
energy is conserved and the trajectories lie on surfaces M of constant
energy. We study the restriction of the flow Ut to a constant energy shell
M for some value of the energy. If dH is non-zero on M the Liouvillian
measure dpdq induces a measure dµ on M according to dµdH = dpdq
[13]. By Liouville’s theorem this measure is preserved by the flow Ut .

(definitions and properties of mixing systems are given in appendix A) all

corresponding to eigenvalues with modulus less than 1. The resolution of
this apparent paradox lies in observing that the L2 (M ) eigenfunctions of
ˆt do not necessarily form a basis in L2 (M ) or even in C ∞ (M ). In fact,
U
ˆt are the
for a mixing system the only square integrable eigenfunctions of U
constant functions which have the eigenvalue 1 (appendix A). In order to
ˆt we need to extend the Hilbert space
find a spectral decomposition for U
L2 (M ) to a rigged Hilbert space as described below. A similar approach
was successfully employed for various maps (see e.g. [9, 10]).

2.2

Rigged Hilbert spaces

A Hilbert space H may be extended to the set of linear functionals on a
suitable dense subspace S. The resulting space S∗ is called the rigging of
H over S. We denote by f [ϕ] the value of the linear functional f ∈ S∗ on
the vector ϕ ∈ S.
A vector g ∈ H may be naturally embedded in S∗ as g[ϕ] = ϕ|g , so
we get a sequence of spaces S ⊂ H ⊂ S∗ . We make the above embedding
explicit [9] and denote the functional f ∈ S∗ by |f ; its value on a vector
ϕ ∈ S being f [ϕ] = ϕ|f . We also introduce the notation f |ϕ for the
antilinear functional f [ϕ].

In general (4) only has asymptotic meaning (see section 2.3 for details),
and will only converge when t > 0 and ξ and ϕ belong to a subspace T of
C ∞ (M ). For the free motion on compact surfaces of constant negative
curvature we find such a subspace which is dense in the set of infinitely differentiable functions. Note, that the eigenfunction |f−λ with the eigenˆt )+ = U−t

where ξ, ϕ ∈ T.
Conversely decomposition (4), can be constructed by analytically continuing F to the left half of the z-plane and analyzing its singularities
and residues. The position of the poles dictate the rate of decay of the
correlation function of the evolution operator [8]. The values of λ in
decomposition (4) are called Ruelle resonances.
Each term in decomposition (4) is well defined for ξ, ϕ ∈ C ∞ (M )
when
the position of the poles of Fξ,ϕ (z)
does not depend on the choice of ξ or ϕ.

(8)

A famous conjecture due to Ruelle [8] states that the poles of the resolvent
for a mixing system do indeed satisfy this condition.
The sum in (4) converges if in addition the residues Res(λ, Fξ,ϕ ) grow
slowly enough when |λ| → ∞:

The set T will comprise of functions in C ∞ (M ) which satisfy condition

To prove the convergence we consider the integral of Fξ,ϕ,t (z) =
ezt ξ|R− (z)|φ for ξ and φ in T around the contour |z| = R for a given
large R. In the limit R → ∞ this integral converges due to (9) to

Evolution operator at long times

We can use the decompositions (4) and (5) to study the approach to
equilibrium at long times for mixing dynamical systems.
We show below that for ξ and ϕ in T the function C(a) in (14) is
independent of a. The behavior at long future times may be approximated
by retaining only the terms in (4) where λ has a small negative real part.

Surfaces of constant negative curvature

We will use the resolvent method described in the previous section to
obtain a spectral decomposition for the evolution operator of a ’model’
chaotic system. The simplest systems which are strongly chaotic (and in
particular mixing) are the free motion on compact 2D surfaces of constant
negative curvature.
The hyperbolic plane N plays the role of a universal cover for these
surfaces. It can be embedded in Minkowski space where the metric is
ds2 = −dx21 + dx22 + dx23
as the surface satisfying the equation
−x21 + x22 + x23 = −1.
We shall consider the free motion on compactifications of N formed by
quotienting it under the action of some discrete group as described below.
We start by analyzing the free motion of a particle on the hyperbolic
plane itself. This dynamical system has the phase space T ∗ N and is
p2
which is just the kinetic energy
described by the Hamiltonian H = 2m
of the particle. The trajectories for this dynamical system are given by
the geodesics of the surface N . For a particle with unit mass m = 1, the
constant energy surface M with energy E = 12 consists of the points with
momenta of unit modulus (and hence also unit speed). Thus the energy
shell M is the unit cotangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane. Changing
the energy amounts to a rescaling which leaves the trajectories unchanged
and only alters the rate at which they are traversed.

8

The group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane G = SO(2, 1) acts
simply transitively on the points of the energy shell. Let us take as a
base point in M the point O = (q, p) where the position q is given by
(0, 0, 1) and the momentum p is (1, 0, 0). A point x on the energy shell
may be identified with the unique element of G which takes O to x = gO.
In this way the constant energy shell can be identified with the elements
of G. The above construction gives a diffeomorphism from the topological
group G to the energy shell M.
We choose a basis for the Lie algebra g of G consisting of the matrices







0 0 1
0 0 0
P = 1 0 0 Q = 0 0 0 K = 0 0 1
(17)
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 −1 0
An element g ∈ G may be written as a product [14]
g(φ, τ, ψ) = eKφ eP τ eKψ .

(18)

The parameters τ , φ and ψ are known as the Euler angles. Note that τ
and φ give the position in polar coordinates:
(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (cosh τ, sinh τ cos φ, sinh τ sin φ)
while the angle ψ gives a consistent way of parameterizing the direction
of the momentum.
After a time t a free particle at the point O on the constant energy
surface advances along the geodesic to which it belongs to the point ht O
where ht = eP t . The point gO moves to ght O; hence on identifying M
with G the evolution corresponds to right multiplication by the element
ht . This 1-parameter group of transformations
g → Ut (g) = ght
is the geodesic flow on G. The measure µ on M which is invariant under
the geodesic flow Ut is the Haar measure dg of the group G. This measure
is invariant under right and left multiplication by elements of the group.
The Ut invariant scalar product for functions on G is therefore given by

Finally we notice that right multiplication by elements in the rotation
subgroup H = {eKψ } only affects the direction of momentum and does
not change the position of the particle. Therefore we can identify the
hyperbolic plane N with the set of right cosets G/H.
9

We now turn to the free motion on general surfaces of constant negative curvature which are constructed by taking a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane G/H and identifying the tessellating shapes (the fundamental
domains). Let Γ be the group of transformations mapping the tessellating shapes to each other. For every γ ∈ Γ the points γgH and gH of
the hyperbolic plane are identified. The points of the quotient surface
formed under this identification are labeled by double cosets in Γ\G/H.
When the directions of momentum at each of the points are included the
constant energy surface M = Γ\G is formed. Since the free motion is
given by the right shift by ht it is not affected by quotienting on the left
by the subgroup Γ, so on the constant energy surface Γ\G the geodesic
flow is given by
Ut (Γg) = Γght

Decomposition of the evolution operator
for the geodesic flows

In this section we use the representation theory of G = SO(2, 1) to find
a decomposition of the form (7) for the resolvent for the geodesic flow on
Γ\G.
The right regular representation TR (h) of G on L2 (Γ\G) is defined by
TR (h)ϕ(Γg) = ϕ(Γgh) where ϕ ∈ L2 (Γ\G).
It can be decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible unitary representations T y which leads to a splitting of L2 (Γ\G) into a direct sum of the
spaces H(T y ) on which T y acts.
L2 (Γ\G) = ⊕ H(T y )

(20)

As the geodesic flow Ut defined in (19) amounts to right multiplication

The rest of this section is organized as follows. In section 4.1 we
discuss the unitary irreducible representations T y . In section 4.2 we study
the decompositions (20) and relate it to the spectra of the Laplacian on
the quotient surface Γ\G/H. In section 4.3 we calculate the integrals
y
R−
(z) for each of these irreducible representations and in section 4.4 we
combine all the results to find R− (z).

4.1

Irreducible representations of SO(2, 1)

Let T be an arbitrary unitary representation of G = SO(2, 1) on the
Hilbert space H(T ) with scalar product
| . The Casimir operator is
defined on H(T ) by
Ω(T ) = L2P (T ) + L2Q (T ) − L2K (T )
where LX (T ) is the Lie derivative of T in the direction X ∈ g and
P, Q, K ∈ g are as defined in (17). This operator commutes with each of
the T (g) [15] and therefore must be a scalar multiple of the identity on
each of the irreducible representations T y . It is convenient to denote by
T ρ the unitary irreducible representation on which this scalar is − 14 − ρ2 ,
i.e. for all v ∈ H(T ρ ) we have:
1
Ω(T ρ )v = (− − ρ2 )v
4

(23)

The following values of ρ are allowed [15]:
• Im ρ = 0 and Re ρ ≥ 0 (the principal series)
• Re ρ = 0 and Im ρ ∈ (0, 21 ) (the complimentary series)
• Re ρ = 0 and Im ρ ∈ N each corresponding to a pair of inequivalent
representations (the discrete series).
In addition we have the 1-dimensional identity representation I for which
Ω(I)v = 0 for v ∈ H(I).
Under the action of the compact abelian subgroup H = {eKt } the
representation T ρ splits into one dimensional irreducible representations.
Let |n ∈ H(T ρ ) be a vector in one such one-dimensional representation
with
T ρ (eKt )|n = eint |n

(24)

It is a fact [16] that in a representation T ρ there is at most one vector
|n for each value n and they can be normalized to form an orthonormal
basis for the space H(T ρ ). We also use the notation |ρ, n when the
irreducible representation to which |n belongs needs to be specified. For
the representations of the principal and complimentary series the value of

11

n ranges over all the integers. For the discrete series, one of the pair has a
basis consisting of |n where n ≥ Im ρ and the other where n ≤ Im ρ [16].
A vector |ϕ in H(T ρ ) may be expanded in the basis {|n } as
|ϕ =

n

n|ϕ |n

(25)

In the basis {|n } the matrix elements for the representation T ρ are given
by [14]
l
m|T ρ (g)|n = eimφ einψ Bmn
(cosh τ )

where l =

l
+ iρ and Bmn
(cosh τ ) are the Jacobi functions.

Decomposition of L2 (Γ\G)

We now consider the decomposition of L2 (Γ\G) into irreducible representations T ρ for a particular quotient surface Γ\G/H.
Suppose that the decomposition (20) of L2 (Γ\G) has Nρ copies of the
irreducible representation T ρ , labeled by s ∈ {1, ..., Nρ }:
N

ρ
L2 (Γ\G) = ⊕ρ (⊕s=1
H(T ρ;s )).

(26)

Each H(T ρ;s ) has a basis {|ρ, n; s } as described in section (4.1). From
(23) and (24) we deduce that the space spanned by the vectors {|ρ, n; s where s =
1, ..., Nρ } is the intersection of the eigenspaces of Ω(TR ) and LK (TR ) with
the eigenvalues − 41 − ρ2 and in respectively.
Ω(TR )|ρ, n; s
Lk (TR )|ρ, n; s

1
= (− − ρ2 )|ρ, n; s
4
= in|ρ, n; s

(27)

The functions |ρ, 0; s are invariant under multiplication on the right
by elements of H and therefore can be viewed as functions in L2 (Γ\G/H).
ˆ hence
On this space the Casimir operator Ω reduces to the Laplacian ∆
the values of ρ occuring in (26) correspond to the eigenvalues ǫ(ρ) =
ˆ on the quotient surface Γ\G/H. Nρ is the
− 41 − ρ2 of the Laplacian ∆
multiplicity of the eigenvalue ǫ(ρ) and |ρ, 0; s are its eigenfunctions. It
ˆ on a compact surface Γ\G/H is
is known that the spectrum ΛΓ of ∆
discrete and is bounded above by 0. It also contains the eigenvalue 0
which corresponds to the the constant eigenfunction. Hence (26) takes
the form:
L2 (Γ\G) =

⊕

− 14 −ρ2 ∈ΛΓ

N

ρ
(⊕s=1
H(T ρ;s )).

(28)

A differential equation for the eigenfunctions |ρ, n; s is obtained by
unwrapping a function in L2 (Γ\G) to give a periodic function on the
whole group χ : G → C which obeys
χ(γg) = χ(g) for all γ ∈ Γ.
12

Using Euler’s coordinates (18) on G in (27) we deduce that the unwrapinψ
ping of the function |ρ, n; s has the form χρ,n

Consequences for the ballistic σ-model

Finally we discuss some consequences of the spectral decomposition (4)
for the ballistic σ-model [4, 5]. Without diving into (the still controversial) issue of the σ-model derivation and its region of validity we quote
below the result for the effective action (see [4, 5, 18] for a detailed discussion):
ˆ + i(ω + i0)Λ W,
dµ tr ΛW −1 L

S=

(44)

where W (x) belongs to some (super)-group and Λ is a particular matrix
in this group obeying Λ2 = 1. The detailed structure of the target space
is somewhat involved and for the purpose of our discussion it suffices to
consider a toy model with W ∈ SU (2) and Λ = diag(1, −1). Then the
target space is a two-dimensional sphere S 2 = SU (2)/U (1) parametrized
by the matrices Q = W −1 ΛW . The action (44) does not depend on the
parametrization of S 2 in terms of W . Indeed, introducing the two-form
Q∗ V on the energy shell M obtained by pulling back the invariant volume
V on S 2 by the function Q(x) : M → S 2 we get for the action:
S=
M

(Q∗ V ) ∧ pdq + i(ω + i0) tr(ΛQ)dµ,

where pdq is the antiderivative of the simplectic structure dp ∧ dq. If Q∗ V
is exact (and it is certainly closed) the first term does not depend on the
choice of the antiderivative but only on the simplectic structure dp ∧ dq.
It is universally believed that some sort of regularization should supplement the effective action (44). It was conjectured [5] that in the limit of
a vanishing regulator the eigenvalues of the regularized Liouvillian operator approach the Ruelle resonances (which were refered to as “eigenvalues
of the Perron Frobenius operator” in [5]).
We would like to point out, that this conjecture must be further clarified due to the existence of the two inequivalent sets of Ruelle resonances.
One set of resonances is in the left half of the complex plane, while the
other is in the right. These two sets originate from the different branches
of the resolvent given by the two integral representations (equations 6
and 15 respectively). As a result there exists two non-equivalent reguˆ Denoting by Lreg the regularization of L
ˆ
larizations of the operator L.
with eigenvalues close to the Ruelle resonances in the left half plane and
observing that the operator −L+
reg has the eigenvalues close to the Ruelle
resonances in the right half plane we suggest that the two regularizations
of L are Lreg and −L+
reg .
We suggest the following structure for the regularized operator in the
target space:
ˆ + i(ω + i0)Λ −→

Mixing dynamical systems

A dynamical system (M, Ut , µ) is mixing if for any two sets A, B ⊂ M
lim µ(Ut A ∩ B) = µ(A)µ(B)

t→∞

(46)

ˆt
For a mixing system the only square integrable eigenfunctions of U
are the constant functions which have the eigenvalue 1. The proof [20] of
this result is reproduced below.
We write (46) in terms of the characteristic functions χA and χB of
the sets A and B (The characteristic function χC of a set C takes on the
value χC (x) = 1 if x ∈ C and 0 otherwise).
ˆt χA |χB = χA |1 1|χB
lim U

t→∞

(47)

Since the space of linear combinations of characteristic functions is dense
in the space of square integrable functions (47) must also be true for
f, g ∈ L2 (M )
ˆt f |g = f |1 1|g
lim U

Let f be an eigenfunction of U
becomes
eλt f |1 = f |1
therefore the eigenvalue must be 1.

Convergence of the spectral decompositions

We now present the necessary condition for the convergence of the spectral decomposition (35):
eλt f−λ |ϕ ξ|fλ .

ξ|T ρ (ht )|ϕ =
λ∈Λρ

(59)

In particular we show it is convergent when ξ and ϕ belong to the dense
subspace Tρ of S ρ ⊂ H(T ρ ) where
K

Tρ = {|ϕ =

n=−K

cn |ρ, n for some K}

(60)

First we show that each term eλt f−λ |ϕ ξ|fλ in (59) is defined for ξ
and ϕ in the subspace Sρ :
Sρ = {|ϕ =

n

cn |ρ, n where

lim cn nq = 0 for all q ∈ N}.

|n|→∞

(61)

Note that Sρ is invariant under T ρ (ht ). Let ξ and ϕ be given by
|ϕ

=

|ξ

=

n

cn |ρ, n

n

dn |ρ, n

(62)

Using f−λ |m n|fλ = aλm bλn we get
|eλt f−λ |ϕ ξ|fλ | <

m,n

λ λ
bn cm dn |
|eλt am

(63)

The eigenvalue λ is of the form l − k or l − k so by (58) aλm = O(mk ) and
bλn = O(nk ). Hence
|eλt f−λ |ϕ ξ|fλ | < C|eλt |

m

|cm mk |

n

|dn nk |

which converges due to (61). Therefore each term is defined for ξ, ϕ ∈ Sρ
and the eigenfunctionals |fη belong to the space Sρ∗ .
Now we show that the sum (59) converges for ξ, ϕ ∈ Tρ . Since the
sums (62) for ξ, ϕ have only a finite number of terms it suffices to prove
convergence for |ϕ = |n and |ξ = |m . In this case (59) reduces to (32)
which converges absolutely for t > 0.

Using the fact that

− 14 −ρ2 ∈ΛΓ s=1

|cρ,s dρ,s | < ξn

ϕn

and that (32) converges absolutely we see from (66) that

is bounded.
Hence taking ξ, ϕ ∈ T ensures the convergence of the spectral decomposition (64). Since the unwrapping of |ρ, n; s has the form χρ;s
n the
unwrappings of functions in T will have only a finite number of Fourier
components in ψ.
