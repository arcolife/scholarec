A Lax Pair for the 2D Euler Equation

This is to report that a Lax pair for the 2D Euler equation is found. We write the 2D Euler
equation in the vorticity form,
∂Ω
+ {Ψ, Ω} = 0 ,
(1.1)
∂t
where Ω is the vorticity, Ψ is the stream function, and the bracket { } is defined as
{f, g} = (∂x f )(∂y g) − (∂y f )(∂x g) .
Let us denote the x-directional and the y-directional velocities by u and v respectively. Then
u=−

The Lax pair is given as
Lϕ = λϕ ,
∂t ϕ + Aϕ = 0 ,

(1.2)

where
Lϕ = {Ω, ϕ} ,

Aϕ = {Ψ, ϕ} ,

and λ is a complex constant, and ϕ is a complex-valued function. The compatibility condition
of the Lax pair (1.2) gives the 2D Euler equation (1.1), i.e.
∂t L = [L, A] ,
where [L, A] = LA − AL, gives the Lax representation of the 2D Euler equation (1.1).
Remark 1.1 With the recent development on chaos in partial differential equations [1] [2]
[3], I am interested in building a dynamical system theory for 2D Euler equation under periodic boundary condition [4] [5]. In particular, I am investigating the existence v.s. nonexistence of homoclinic structure. For such studies, it will be fundamentally important to find
a Lax pair (if it exists) for the 2D Euler equation. Then I started with Vladimir Zakharov’s
paper [6]. Zakharov proposed the Lax pair
λD1 ϕ + {Ω, ϕ} = 0 ,
∂t ϕ + λD2 ϕ + {S, ϕ} = 0 ,

α, β, γ, and δ are real constants, λ is a complex constant, S is a real-valued function, and ϕ
is a complex-valued function. The compatibility condition of this Lax pair gives the following
equation instead of the 2D Euler equation,

Remark 1.2 The author is also aware of the Lax pair in the inverse Cauchy-Green tensor
variable of the Lagrangian formulations of both 2D and 3D Euler equations found by Susan
Friedlander and Misha Vishik [7] [8].
