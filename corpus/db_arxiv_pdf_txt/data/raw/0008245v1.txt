Abstract
The approach to the ergodic limit in Monte Carlo simulations is studied using both analytic
and numerical methods. With the help of a stochastic model, a metric is defined that enables the
examination of a simulation in both the ergodic and non-ergodic regimes. In the non-ergodic regime,
the model implies how the simulation is expected to approach ergodic behavior analytically, and the
analytically inferred decay law of the metric allows the monitoring of the onset of ergodic behavior.
The metric is related to previously defined measures developed for molecular dynamics simulations,
and the metric enables the comparison of the relative efficiencies of different Monte Carlo schemes.
Applications to Lennard-Jones 13-particle clusters are shown to match the model for Metropolis,
J-walking and parallel tempering based approaches. The relative efficiencies of these three Monte
Carlo approaches are compared, and the decay law is shown to be useful in determining needed high
temperature parameters in parallel tempering and J-walking studies of atomic clusters.

length of the MC walk, and variations of computed properties with K provide information about the convergence
of the simulation on a long time scale.
Given an infinite time, the stochastic walker in a MC
simulation visits every allowed point in configuration
space. [2] Ergodic behavior is reached when the length
of the walk is sufficiently long to sample configuration
space appropriately. [3] In practice, this does not mean
that the space has been densely covered but that every
region with non-negligible probability has been reached.
In such a case we can say that the simulation is effectively
ergodic or that it has reached the ergodic limit.
For a finite walk, in the event of broken ergodicity [4],
phase space is effectively disconnected. The different disconnected regions (called components) are separated by
barriers of zero effective probability. If a stochastic walker
starts its walk in one of these regions, it may not cross the
barriers within the time of the simulation. If the simulation length is increased, some barriers may become accessible for the walker and phase space is better sampled. We
can conclude that a time τ exists such that, for simulation
lengths shorter than τ , the walker becomes trapped in one
of the phase space components. For simulation lengths
much larger than τ , phase space is effectively covered by
the walker.
In this study we imagine a system having more than one
time scale τ1 ≪ τ2 ≪ . . . ≪ τΛ . In a Monte Carlo simulation each scale comes from stochastic processes with

I. INTRODUCTION

A goal of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in statistical
mechanics [1] is the calculation of ensemble mean values
of thermodynamic quantities. Ensemble mean values are
multidimensional integrals over configuration space
U =

dx P (x) U (x) ,

(1)

where P (x) is the probability of finding a system in the
state defined by x, and the functional form of P (x) depends on the ensemble investigated. MC simulations usually generate a sampling of configuration space {xk }K
k=1 by
the use of a stochastic process with stationary probability
P (xk ). The quantity U evaluated at xk is the output of
the simulation U (xk ) = Uk , and its arithmetic mean value
U , in principle, must approach the ensemble mean value.
[1] In this paper we refer to the set of configurations generated in a Monte Carlo simulation as a time sequence, and
we study the behavior of these temporal sequences {Uk }
and their arithmetic mean, to understand better how MC
simulations approach ergodic behavior. It is important to
emphasize that there are two time variables to consider.
The time variable k labels the separate configurations generated in a Monte Carlo walk. Variations of properties
with k provide information about the short-time behavior
of a MC simulation. The time variable K labels the total

different correlation times. [5] A precise definition of the
correlation times for Monte Carlo processes is given in
Section III, but for the moment we can think of these correlation times as identical to physical time scales of the
system under study. To understand these time scales more
fully, it is useful to focus on an example. Prototypical of
systems having such disparate time scales are atomic and
molecular clusters. Typical cluster potential surfaces have
many local minima separated by significant energy barriers. [6–8] The local minima can be grouped into basins
of similar energies, with each basin separated from other
basins again by energy barriers. At short Monte Carlo
times a cluster system executes small amplitude oscillations about one of its potential minima. We can think of
these vibrational time scales as the shortest time scales
that define a cluster system. As the simulation time is
extended the system eventually hops between different local minima within the same basin. The time scale for
the first hops between local minima can be considered
the next shortest time scale for the simulation. At still
longer Monte Carlo times, the system hops between different energy basins defining yet another time scale for the
simulation. This grouping of time scales continues until
the longest time scale for a given system is reached. At
Monte Carlo times that are long compared to this longest
time scale, the simulation is ergodic.
Consider a system with several time scales as mentioned
above. If the length of the simulation is smaller than the
smallest correlation time, the walker may become trapped
in an effectively disconnected region and the sampling of
phase space is incomplete. By increasing the time, the
memory of the initial condition in the sampling decreases
as the walker crosses to other previously unreachable regions. These oscillations and hoppings can be modeled by
a superposition of stochastic processes with different correlation times. These processes with non-zero correlation
times are known as colored noise processes (as opposed
to zero correlation time white noise processes). [5] From
the study of the autocorrelation functions of a stochastic model defined using these colored noise processes, we
can verify that, at a fixed run length K, there exist two
different groups of processes; those that contribute to the
autocorrelation function with terms that decay like 1/k
(called diffusive processes), and those that contribute to
the autocorrelation function with terms that decay slower
than 1/k (called non-diffusive processes). When the time
of the simulation is increased, some non-diffusive processes
at shorter run lengths, start to contribute to the autocorrelation function like diffusive processes. After the walk
length reaches the largest correlation time τΛ , all processes
contribute to the autocorrelation function with terms that
decay like 1/k. At this point, the simulation is at the diffusive regime and effective ergodicity has been reached.
A principal goal of this work is to investigate the way in
which the MC output {Uk } reaches the diffusive limit (i.e.
the ergodic limit) by studying the properties of autocorrelation functions under changes of scale in time, K → bK
with b > 1. By time scaling it is possible to infer the decay
2

law of the non-diffusive contributions with respect to the
total simulation time K. The functional dependence of
the non-diffusive contributions on the parameter b that is
used to scale K is determined empirically. We have found
the decay law so determined to be a particularly valuable
method of concluding when a simulation can be considered
ergodic. Unlike previous studies [3,9–11] that only have
investigated the behavior of certain autocorrelation functions in the ergodic regime, by focusing on the approach
to ergodic behavior we have a more careful monitor of the
onset of ergodicity. Once the non-diffusive contributions
have decayed to a point where they are too small to be
distinguished from zero to within the fluctuations of the
calculation, we can say that the ergodic limit has been
reached.
The autocorrelation functions we use to measure the
approach to the ergodic limit are based on one of the
probes of ergodicity developed by Thirumalai and coworkers [3,9–11], and is often called the energy metric.
The energy metric has been proposed as an alternative to
other techniques [3] (like the study of the Lyapunov exponents [12]) for the study of ergodic properties in molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. The metric has been used to
study the relative efficiency of MC simulation methods
as well. [13] The MC metric as used in the current work
can easily be extended from the energy to other scalar
observables of the system.
We present two key issues in this paper. First, from the
knowledge of the decay law of the non-diffusive contributions to the MC metric, we infer how long a simulation
must be to be considered effectively ergodic. Second, once
the ergodic limit is reached, we can compare the results
from different numerical algorithms to measure relative
efficiencies. Because the outcomes of MC simulations are
noisy, we have found it useful to separate diffusive and
non-diffusive terms in the MC metric with a Fourier analysis so that we can neglect the high frequency components of the noise. This technique has given reproducible
results.
To test the match between the stochastic model and actual Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the approach
to ergodic behavior in simulations of Lennard-Jones clusters. Recently [14,15] we have studied the thermodynamic
properties of Lennard-Jones clusters as a function of temperature using both J-walking [16] and parallel tempering methods. [17–19] Both simulation techniques require
an initial high temperature that must be ergodic when
Metropolis Monte Carlo methods [20] are used. If the
Metropolis method does not give ergodic results at the
initial high temperature, systematic errors propagate to
the lower temperatures in J-walking and parallel tempering simulations, and the results can be flawed or meaningless. In most Monte Carlo simulations of clusters at
finite temperatures, [21,22] the clusters are defined by enclosing the atoms within a constraining potential about
the center of mass of the system. The constraining potential is necessary because clusters at finite temperatures
have finite vapor pressures, and the association of any one

Before discussing the major developments of this work,
it is useful to understand the nature of the problem we
are attempting to solve by examining some numerical results on a prototypical system. We take the 13-particle
Lennard-Jones cluster defined by the potential function

and is displayed in the upper panel of Fig. 1 as a function of the walk length k for 20 independent simulations
each initialized from a random configuration. Over the
maximum time scale K of the walks, it apparent that the
potential energy averaged over each independent walk has
not converged to the same result. Such unreproducible
behavior is symptomatic of a simulation not yet at the
ergodic limit.

Vk

atom with the cluster can be ill-defined. From experience
[14,15,23] we have found that if the radius of the constraining potential and the initial high temperature are
not both carefully chosen, it can be difficult to attain ergodicity with Metropolis methods. A key concern then is
the choice of constraining radius and the choice of initial
temperature. We verify the stochastic model by investigating Monte Carlo simulation results as a function of the
temperature and the size of the constraining potential.
The contents of the remainder of this paper are as follows. In Section II we motivate the studies that follow by
examining numerally the behavior of a set of Monte Carlo
simulations of a 13-particle Lennard-Jones cluster. This
cluster system is used to illustrate the results throughout this paper. In Section III we introduce the stochastic
model based on a continuous time sequence. In Section
IV we extend the model to discrete time sequences characteristic of actual Monte Carlo simulations. In Section V
we test the discrete stochastic model with applications to
Lennard-Jones clusters and in Section VI we summarize
our conclusions. Many of the key derivations needed for
the developments are found in two appendices.

The 13-particle Lennard-Jones cluster has a complex potential surface with many minima separated by significant
energy barriers, [6–8] and ergodicity problems associated
with the simulation of properties of this system are wellknown. [16] We now consider a Metropolis MC simulation of the average potential energy of the system in the

Rc has been set to 4σ and kB T /ε = 0.393. At least two basins with
different energies are present. Clearly, dk goes to a constant when
k is increased within the total time scale of the simulation.

At the ergodic limit (i.e. for the maximum walk length
K greater than that included in Fig. 1) the averages dis3

played in the upper panel of Fig. 1 must approach the
same value for each walker. Using related ideas developed
elsewhere, [3,9,10] the extent to which the walks approach
the same limit can be measured in terms of a metric dk

In Eq. (6) M represents the number of independent walks,
(i)

and V k is the average potential energy computed in walk
i at MC time k. The metric measures the energy fluctuations in the walk as a function of the walk length. For
an ergodic simulation, the metric must decay to zero. For
the 20 simulations of the 13-particle Lennard-Jones cluster, the metric as a function of k is plotted in the lower
panel of Fig. 1. Rather than asymptotically approaching
zero, over the short length of the walk displayed here, dk
has decayed to a constant, and as discussed later in this
paper, over the time scale of this simulation, dk can be
qualitatively represented by the function
AK
dk =

k

(7)

where AK and BK are coefficients that are dependent on
the total walk length K. As K is increased to a time
where the walk is ergodic, BK must decay to zero. Major
goals of this work are to understand how BK decays and
to use the discovered decay law to determine the onset
of ergodic behavior. Our approach is to introduce first a
continuous stochastic model of a simulation followed by a
discrete model more clearly linked to actual MC studies.
III. STOCHASTIC MODEL

We have discussed in the introduction how the output
of MC simulations can be considered to be a combination
of stochastic processes with different time scales, and how
the contributions to autocorrelation function from these
processes can vary when the length of the simulation is
enlarged. Here we present a continuous time model for
the stochastic processes that occur in a simulation. Even
though a MC simulation occurs in a discrete time (each
MC point represents a time unit), we find that the continuous model helps to understand better the ideas used
in the modeling of the MC output.
In this section the ensemble mean value is used to find
the expression for the autocorrelation functions of the
model. Although in actual numerical calculations the ensemble mean is replaced by a mean over a finite number
of independent experiments, the results obtained here give
information about the limit of an infinite sample.
The stationary process used to sample space is a
stochastic process. We assume the output of the MC simulation can be modeled by a linear superposition of stochastic processes with different correlation times τℓ ≥ 0,

ℓ=1

where Uc is a constant, the random variable ξ(t) represents
white noise processes with zero correlation time (τ0 = 0),
and the {gℓ (t/τℓ )} are stochastic processes with correlation times τℓ > 0. ξ(t) and gℓ (t/τℓ ) have units of the
square root of time, and Γ0 and Γℓ are constants with
units of U 2 /t. If U is chosen to be the the x-coordinate
of a particle, Γ0 and Γℓ have units of a diffusion constant.
Consequently we refer to these constants as generalized
diffusion coefficients. The white noise process has the following properties [5]
ξ(t) = 0
ξ(t) ξ(t′ ) = δ(t − t′ ) ,

(9)
(10)

and the remaining colored noise processes are assumed to
satisfy

so that they represent processes with a memory fℓ . Even
though correlations between processes with different correlation times may be non-zero, we assume the processes
to be independent, i.e.
gℓ (t/τℓ ) gℓ′ (t′ /τℓ′ ) = gℓ (t/τℓ ) gℓ′ (t′ /τℓ′ )
= 0 ∀ ℓ = ℓ′
ξ(t) gℓ (t′ /τℓ ) = ξ(t) gℓ (t′ /τℓ )
= 0 ∀ t and t′ .

(14)

The memory function is assumed to be a continuous function that depends only on the distance between t and t′
disregarding the time origin (stationary condition). The
memory function represents the correlation between two
times of the process gℓ . In our model we impose the condition

The scope and implications of the leftmost inequality are

the conditions fℓ must satisfy in order to yield contributions to autocorrelation function that decay more weakly
than 1/t. We now assume that this inequality can be
taken as a bound to possible maxima of fℓ appearing at
t > 0. The rightmost inequality enables us to assume fℓ

we study the behavior of the temporal mean U(t)

For all times shorter than τ1 the autocorrelation function
is the sum of diffusive contributions (proportional to 1/t)
plus non-diffusive contributions. These contributions implicitly depend on t> through t∗ℓ (t> ). We assume that fℓ

scales shorter than τℓ ; see Appendix A).
We next consider the behavior of Eq. (28) for time
scales greater than τ1 . Under the scale change t → bt
such that τ1 ≪ bt> ≪ τ2 , the contributions to the correlation function from the process with correlation time
τ1 can be considered diffusive [in other words, by virtue
of Eqs. (10) and (12), f1 /τ1 has become a delta function]. With bt> ≪ τ2 , the other processes preserve their
old properties. Then, the autocorrelation function can be

Observe that in the present case, our finite sample of the
infinite ensemble is the set of outcomes from M independent numerical experiments. The metric we have defined
in Eq. (35) can be contrasted with alternative metrics
[3,9,10] previously defined for molecular dynamics simulations. These alternative metrics examine the fluctuations
of two simulations initialized from different components of
configuration space averaged with respect to all the particles in the system. The metric we use in this work is determined using an average with respect to M independent
simulations that represent a subset of the full ensemble.
Using the model presented in Eq. (30), we now develop
a way to predict the behavior of the MC simulation in
the non-ergodic and the ergodic regimes. We first consider the case that the total simulation time K is larger
than the first correlation time τ1 but shorter than τ2 , i.e.
τ1 ≪ K ≪ τ2 . The expression for dk is given by

ΓK and ΥK are the quantities that carry the long time
dependence. Short time features appear in the 1/k dependence and in the remaining noise γk . If the sequences
considered are increased in size by a factor of b, such that
τλ−1 ≪ K ≪ τλ ≪ bK for a given 1 ≤ λ ≤ Λ, ΓK (ΥK )
is increased (decreased) (see Appendix B). Then,

where ΥbK must go to zero and ΓbK must approach a
constant when b is increased. By virtue of the expected
behavior of the non-diffusive contributions (see Appendix
A), we propose the following expression for ΥbK
ΥbK = ΥK φ(b) ,

(48)

where φ(b) is a decreasing function of b. Moreover, ΥbK
is a sum of non-diffusive contributions. As presented in
Appendix A, each non-diffusive contribution to the autocorrelation function has a relative variation smaller than
the relative variation of the diffusive contribution, namely
1 − 1/b. If this inequality is applicable to the sum of nondiffusive contributions, we have that

where βk represents additional random noise. Then, for
a given length k ≤ K, the MC metric dk can be approximated by
dk = 2

(42)

If K is enlarged, we expect to have a larger value of ΓK .
Υk is a quantity related to the memory functions fℓ with
correlation times τℓ ≫ K. In the continuous time model,
the colored noise processes contribute to the autocorrelation function with terms proportional to fℓ (t∗ℓ (t> )/τℓ ),
which are weakly dependent on t (see Appendix A). We
can expect Υk to be weakly dependent on k, and for sequences of length K and for M sufficiently large, we consider this quantity roughly to be a constant
Υ k ≃ Υ K + βk .

In Appendix B we present a study of the way non-diffusive
contribution become diffusive under time scale changes. If
M is sufficiently large and τ1 ≪ K ≪ τ2 , by virtue of Appendix B, Γk must roughly be a constant. By roughly a
constant we mean a constant C plus some rapidly fluctuating function ζk , with the following properties: a) ζk = 0
and b) |C| ≫ maxk=1,2,...,K (|ζk |). Then

with 0 < υ < 1 and 0 < η ≤ 1. Equation (53) can be
thought as the limit of Eq. (52) when the exponent goes

(48). However, as is discussed in Section V, our numerical
7

experience has shown Eq. (48) to be obeyed in all cases
we have examined.
Our goal is to develop a criterion to decide when the
simulation can be considered ergodic. From the previous considerations it is clear that the ergodic limit is
reached when ΥK is indistinguishable from zero. The
output from a MC simulation is usually noisy. ThereYK (ωn ) = kdk (ωn ) =

fore, γk can not be neglected. A useful way to separate
diffusive and non-diffusive contributions and to eliminate
the stochastic noise from Eq. (46), is to perform a Fourier
analysis of the function kdk . Let us define the frequencies
ωn = (2π/K) n, with n = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1. The discrete
Fourier transform of the function kdk is the signal YK (ωn )

In general, kγk (ωn ) is negligible except at high frequencies. For small positive values of the frequency we can
make the approximation cot(ωn /2) ≃ 2/ωn . From this
approximation we have
Im (YK (ωn )) ≃

(56)

The real part of Eq. (55) for positive frequencies is
Re (YK (ωn )) = ΥK .

(57)

Even though simpler than Eq. (56), we have found Eq.
(57) is more sensitive to the deviations of dk from the approximation Eq. (46). Therefore, the data obtained from
the real part is of poorer quality than the data obtained
from the imaginary part.
Equation (56) implies that for a given simulation length
K, the contributions to the MC metric from the nondiffusive process can be determined from a simple relationship involving the Fourier transform of the function
kdk at low frequencies. By increasing the length of the
run K by a factor of b, it is possible to observe the dependence of ΥbK on bK.
V. APPLICATIONS

The concepts developed in the previous sections are sufficiently general to be applied to any kind of MC simulation. We devote the present section to the application of the developments of this paper to the study of the
Lennard-Jones 13-particle cluster in the canonical ensemble. This system has been introduced previously in Sec.
II.
Some thermodynamic properties of clusters as a function of temperature exhibit rapid changes that are reminiscent of similar changes that occur for the same properties in bulk systems at phase transitions. In a bulk system
a phase transition occurs at a single temperature. For
8

(55)

clusters the rapid changes in thermodynamic properties
occur over a finite temperature interval. To distinguish
the temperature range where thermodynamic properties
change rapidly in clusters from a true phase transition,
we follow Berry et al. [25] and refer to such changes in
physical properties as associated with a phase change. A
common property that has been found to be useful in monitoring these phase change intervals of temperature is the
heat capacity at constant volume [26]
CV (T ) =

where · T represents the classical canonical mean value.
In this work we consider the bare Metropolis (Met), [20]
J-walking (Jw), [16] and parallel tempering (PT) [17–19]
approaches to Monte Carlo simulations. The free variable
of all these methods is the reduced temperature kB T /ε.
In PT and Jw simulations, the highest temperature used
(Th ) must be sufficiently large to ensure that Met is ergodic. [16] From experience simulating a variety of systems, we have found that Th must also be lower than a
temperature Tb where cluster evaporation events become
frequent. It is useful to think of Tb as the cluster analogue of a boiling temperature. We have found that Met
is unable to sample the boiling phase change region for
clusters ergodically, using total time scales accessible to
current simulations.
(m)
For the results that follow, Uk is chosen to be represented by the potential energy of the system. In general
(m)
Uk can be any scalar property of the system. We define
a pass to represent a set of single particle MC moves taken
sequentially over the 13 particles in the cluster. We take
(m)
Uk to be the potential energy at the k ′ th pass, in the
m′ th experiment. Using Eq. (55) we can write
YK (0) = 2 ΓK + (K + 1) ΥK .

(59)

In the non-ergodic regime, YK (0) grows with K, while in
the ergodic regime, the signal YK (0) approaches a constant.

a temperature of kB Th /ε = 0.393. The temperature is
chosen to be that typically used as the initial high temperature in Jw and PT studies of LJ13 . By choosing a
large constraining radius, the evaporation events are so
frequent at the chosen temperature that attaining ergodicity proves to be quite difficult. We demonstrate the effect
of reducing the constraining radius shortly.

K for Rc = 4σ at kB Th /ε = 0.393. from M = 40 independent experiments, of LJ13 . The length of the simulation is 104 MC passes.
The lower panel shows the “time evolution” of U K (in units of ε)
for 15 independent experiments. At least three basins with different
energies are present. Clearly, the simulation at this scale of time, is
not ergodic.

The number of replicas used in the calculation is M = 40,
and K = 104 . The upper panel of Fig. 2 shows the signal YK (0) [evaluated using Eq. (54)], which grows along
the entire simulation. This is the behavior expected in
the non-ergodic regime. In the lower panel we can see
J. P. Neirotti, D. L. Freeman. and J. D. Doll

There are three sets of curves, each of which is indicative
of sampling of at least three different energy basins. At
low values of K the curves in the lower panel differ significantly. At K ≃ 4 000 the high energy basin curves begin
to decrease in energy. For a value of K larger than the
data displayed in Fig. 2, the curves can be expected to
coalesce with the low energy basin curves. It is clear that
for K ≤ 10 000, the simulation is not ergodic.
In PT and Jw studies it is essential that the initial high
temperature walk be ergodic. Ergodicity can be attained
for LJ13 by reducing the radius of the constraining potential so that evaporation events are rare. We now present
a study of ΥK as a function of K for several values of
Rc . To determine ΥK , we have calculated the Fourier
transform function YK (ωn ) using Eq. (54) at a series of
frequencies ωn = 2πn/K where n has ranged from 1 to
9

√
min( 12bK/20π, 100). This range of frequencies ensures
the linear approximation used in Eq. (55) is valid while
including sufficient numbers of points for accuracy. [27]
Using Eq. (56), we have calculated the slope of the imaginary part of 1/YK (ωn ) as a function of ωn , for these frequencies. The data points appearing in Fig. 3 are the
mean value over twenty independent calculations of the
slope of 1/YK (ωn ).

Fig. 4: ΥbK (in units of ε2 ) and its error vs. log2 (b) for
Rc = 2.5σ and 2σ, with K = 104 . When ΥbK is on the order of its
own error, the simulation can be considered ergodic. For Rc = 2σ
the simulation becomes ergodic at log2 (b) ≃ 4 (bK ≃ 16 × 104 ). For
Rc = 2.5σ a longer simulation is needed to reach ergodicity.

Starting from random configurations, we have performed 5 × 104 Met passes at kB Th /ε = 0.393. After
this warmup process, we have created sequences of sizes
bK = 104 , 2 × 104 , 4 × 104 , . . ., 64 × 104 . The results are
presented in Fig. 3 for Rc = 4σ, 3σ, 2.5σ, and 2σ. The
upper panel shows ΥbK as a function of log2 (b), for fixed
K = 104 . We have chosen to present the data using base
2 logarithms for clarity (each increase by 1 unit of log2 (b)
represents a factor of 2 scale increase). All the data decrease with increasing b, but only Rc = 2σ and Rc = 2.5σ
appear to vanish to within the error bars over the time
scale of the current simulation. In the lower panel we
present ΥK /ΥbK as a function of log2 (b) for Rc = 4 and

Fig. 5: The upper panel shows the decay behavior of ΥbK (in
units of ε2 ) as a function of log2 (b) for PT and Met, at the temperature of the melting peak of the heat capacity, kB Tm /ε = 0.282.
From Eq. (52), we plot log2 (ΥK /ΥbK ) vs. log2 (b), to extract the
value of the exponent υ (the slope of the linear fit). We have found
υ = 0.93 ± 0.03 for PT, and υ = 0.94 ± 0.02 for Met. The straight
lines are the best linear fits of the data points.

We have stated that the simulation can be considered
effectively ergodic when ΥK is indistinguishable from zero.
In Fig. 4 we have plotted ΥbK and its statistical error as a
function of log2 (b) for Rc = 2.5 and 2σ. For Rc = 2σ the
crossing point of ΥbK and its error is at bK ≃ 16 × 104 .
For Rc = 2.5σ the crossing point is at a bK > 64 × 104 .
We can conclude that for kB Th /ε = 0.393 and Rc = 2σ
the simulation can be considered effectively ergodic after
16 × 104 Met passes.
Once a constraining radius is chosen, PT and Jw simulations require the highest temperature Th be chosen so
that Met is ergodic. For a given Rc , the extent of ergodicity can be tested using the same metric that has been used
for determining the optimum value of Rc , but by varying

the temperature. For the parameters kB Th /ε = 0.393 and
Rc = 2σ the simulation is ergodic even at very short sequence lengths. We have found that for kB Th /ε < 0.393
the simulations are not ergodic. To be sure that the parameters are appropriate, we have performed a short PT
simulation (104 passes, ten PT passes consists of nine Met
passes plus an exchange attempt) with 40 equally spaced
temperatures in the range kB T /ε =[0.028,0.393] in order
to obtain a first estimate of the position of the melting
and boiling temperature regions. The boiling peak in the
specific heat appears to be located at a higher temperature than kB T /ε = 0.393. Moreover, the value of CV at
kB T /ε = 0.393 is about one-half the value of CV at the
temperature of the melting peak kB Tm /ε = 0.282. From
these results we feel it is safe to choose Rc = 2σ and
kB Th /ε = 0.393 for the calculations that follow.
We now illustrate the convergence characteristics of ΥK
when we increase the total time scale of the calculation by
a factor b. We illustrate this behavior using a PT simulation of LJ13 , and we focus on results at the temperature of
the melting peak in the heat capacity (kB Tm /ε = 0.282).
We choose this temperature, because from experience
[14,15,23] we know the statistical fluctuations are large at
the melting heat capacity maximum. The large statistical
fluctuations make it possible to emphasize the behavior
of ΥK . We have run the PT simulation at 40 equally
spaced temperatures in the range kB T /ε = [0.028,0.393].
The initial warmup time has been set to 104 Met passes,
followed by 2 × 104 PT passes. Following the warm-up
period, we perform simulations of 105 , 2 × 105 , 4 × 105 ,
8 × 105, 16 × 105, and 32 × 105 PT passes. In each case the
initial configuration has been taken to be the last configuration of the previous run. The output of the simulation
are sequences of the potential energy. ΥK has been determined in the same way as in the calculation of the high
temperature parameters (presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).
The data points appearing in the upper panel of Fig. 5
are the mean value over twenty independent calculations
of the slope of 1/YK (ωn ). In the lower panel of Fig. 5
we have plotted log2 (ΥK /ΥbK ) as a function of log2 (b),
where K = 104 and b = 1, 2, 4, . . . , 32. The slope of the
linear fit is the exponent υ, according to Eq. (52). At the
temperature of the melting peak, υ = 0.93 ± 0.03.
It is of interest to perform a similar study of the behavior of ΥK as a function of the time scaling for an Met calculation. We have taken the final configuration of the PT
simulation at kB Tm /ε = 0.282 as an initial configuration,
and we have performed a simple Met simulation at that
melting temperature. A graph of ΥbK and log2 (ΥK /ΥbK )
as a function of log2 (b) for Met is also presented in Fig.
5. From the upper panel of Fig. 5, it is evident that Met
results are not ergodic within the same scaled time as the
PT results. It is also evident that the power law exponent
for both Met and PT are not distinguishable. Similar
studies of the power law using the Jw method also give
the same exponent. Neither an increase in the number
of temperatures nor changing the distribution of temperatures in both Jw and PT simulations has any effect on

Fig. 6: Comparison of the Met and Jw diffusion coefficients
with the PT diffusion coefficient as a function of the reduced temperature. The dashed line represents equivalence between methods.

By using the results to compare the relative efficiencies
of Met, Jw and PT simulations for the LJ13 system. We
have found that PT and Jw simulations can be considered
ergodic if the run length is on the order of 2 × 105 passes,
while Met simulations that are initialized from configurations generated from an ergodic PT study are ergodic
when the total run length consists of 2 × 106 passes or
more.
In order to compare approaches, we have calculated Γ
as a function of the reduced temperature, for the three
methods. The comparison of diffusion coefficients from
different algorithms has also been used by Andricioaei and
Straub [13]. The comparison of Jw and Met with PT is
presented in Fig. 6. The Jw and PT simulations are found
to have comparable efficiencies using Γ as a measure for all
calculated temperatures. At intermediate temperatures,
Met is significantly less efficient. We have chosen to truncate the Jw study at kB T /ε = 0.12. For temperatures
below kB T /ε = 0.12, Jw simulations require significant effort, because a large set of external distributions must be
generated. Because at temperatures below kB T /ε = 0.12
11

LJ13 is dominated by structures close to the lowest energy
icosahedral isomer, we expect the Jw and PT methods to
have similar efficiencies (as measured by Γ) for all temperatures.
VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a study of the approach
to the ergodic limit in MC simulations. In all the cases
examined, the behavior of the MC metric dk can be approximated by Eq. (46), and the behavior of ΥbK satisfies
Eq. (48). Because the exponent υ is smaller than one for
all the cases studied, the dependence of the non-diffusive
contributions on dk is weaker (in the sense of Appendix
A) than the diffusive contributions. The assumption on
which we have built the stochastic model have been verified numerically for a system having a sufficiently complex
potential surface to be viewed as prototypical of a large
set of many-particle systems.
The MC metric used in this work appears to be a valuable tool to study the ergodicity properties of MC simulations. The non-ergodic components of the MC metric
enable the prediction of the minimum length a MC simulation must have in order to be considered ergodic. The
comparison of Γ from different algorithms gives a reasonable estimate of their relative efficiencies.
From the study of the melting region of 13 particle clusters, we have found that the exponent υ depends both on
the method used and the nature of the potential energy
function. We have performed calculations, not discussed
in this work, where the functional form of the potential
energy is modified. These studies have shown υ to be
dependent on the details of the potential. We have not
found the exponent υ to be a strong function of method.
Although PT and Met have significantly different efficiencies as measured by their relative diffusion coefficients, υ is
nearly the same in the two methods. The difference in the
decay of ΥK appears to be dominated by the coefficient
in Eqs.(48) and (52) rather than the exponent.
As discussed in the text, parallel tempering and Jwalking studies of many-particle systems must have an
initial high temperature component that is chosen so that
a Met simulation is known to be ergodic. For cluster simulations that require an external constraining potential to
define the cluster, the radius of the constraining potential must be carefully chosen in order to achieve ergodic
results. We have found the metric and associated decay
laws developed in this work to be a particularly valuable
method of choosing these initial parameters in both parallel tempering and J-walking simulations.
We also remark that the metric introduced here may be
a more sensitive probe of ergodicity than may be required
in some applications. For example in previous J-walking
studies [26] of the 13-particle Lennard-Jones cluster, the
heat capacity curve determined with a constraining radius
of 4σ is nearly indistinguishable from the curve obtained
with a constraining radius of 2σ. From the results of this
12

work, we know the initial high temperature walk is not
ergodic when a constraining radius of 4σ is used. It is
striking that the non-ergodicity as measured by the energy metric is not apparent in the heat capacity curve.
We have constructed a metric based on an ensemble of
MC trajectories. By using an ensemble we attempt to
cover sufficient portions of space so that all components
are accessible. In practice only a finite subset of a full
ensemble can be included, and it is always possible that
components of space are missed. In such a case ΥK may
decay to zero numerically within the subspace, and the behavior may give misleading evidence that the simulation
is ergodic. Because components of space may be missed in
any finite simulation, it is impossible to guarantee ergodicity. It is hoped by using a sufficiently large ensemble of
trajectories to define the metric, the possibility of missing
components is minimized.

APPENDIX A: WEAK DEPENDENCE OF THE
NON-DIFFUSIVE CONTRIBUTIONS

We have considered two overall time scales for a MC
simulation. Properties calculated at short times (labeled
k in the discrete case) provide information about each step
of the MC process, and properties averaged over the total
simulation time (labeled K in the discrete case) give information about the approach to ergodic behavior. When
K is sufficiently short we have both diffusive and nondiffusive contributions as a function of k. In this Appendix we explain the relative time dependence of the
diffusive and non-diffusive contributions to the autocorrelation function.
It has been assumed that the autocorrelation function
Eq. (28) can be expressed as the sum of diffusive terms
plus non-diffusive terms, i.e.

Increasing the time variables by a factor b > 1, such

Here we have presented the two first conditions fℓ must
have, namely Eqs. (A8) and (A9). From Eq. (19) fℓ (0)
is a global maximum, and the memory functions must

fℓ (0) must be sufficiently large to satisfy Eq. (A9), even
at points where fℓ (t/τ ) is a local maximum. Then, to
satisfy this Lemma, we need a memory function with a
sufficiently large global maximum at t = 0.

then 0 < ∆nd , ℓ (t, t′ ; b) < 1 for all pair of times t and t′ .

If the right derivative at 0 of ∆Fℓ (t) is negative, ∆Fℓ (t)
approaches −Fℓ (t> ) from below, when t → 0. There exists
a time 0 < t˜ < t> , such that 0 > Fℓ (t> ) + ∆Fℓ (t˜), in contradiction with Eq. (A50). Then, fℓ must be non-negative
for t ∈ (0, t> ). By the property Eq. (19) fℓ (0) must be
positive. This proves that ∆nd , 1 (t, t′ ; b) < ∆d (t, t′ ; b) ⇒
fℓ (t) ≥ 0 for 0 ≤ t < t> . To demonstrate that if fℓ is positive yields ∆nd , 1 (t, t′ ; b) < ∆d (t, t′ ; b) (i.e. the converse),
follow the argument backwards, from Eq. (A30). ✷
In conclusion, if the memory functions are positive, satisfy the Lipschitz condition, and satisfy the condition Eqs.
(A8) and (A9), the non-diffusive contributions are more
weakly dependent on time than 1/t.
The results of the present appendix are valid in the limit
of a complete ensemble. In our numerical experiments
only partial samples of the ensemble can be considered.
The memory functions that appear in our numerical calculations come from partial mean values of the product of

APPENDIX B: CONSEQUENCES OF THE TIME
SCALE CHANGE IN THE NON-DIFFUSIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS

In this appendix we show the behavior of the function f1 when its correlation time is changed according to
τ1 → τb1 = τ1 /b, with b ≫ 1; i.e. when the total simulation time is scaled to exceed the correlation time of the
first colored noise process.
We multiply the time variables by a number b, such that
τ1 ≪ bt> ≪ τ2 . We have that the g1 process contributes
to the autocorrelation function with

discontinuous functions (every noise process is a discontinuous function). These memory functions are discontinuous. The behavior of the non-diffusive contributions
observed in our numerical experiments is in agreement
with these analytic (infinite ensemble limit) results. We
can infer that there might be a version of the theorem
applied to discontinuous memory functions, but we have
been unable to develop such a theorem.

We can observe that the correlation time τb1 goes to zero when b is increased. The function (1/τ1 ) f1 (bt/τ1 ) becomes
negligible outside a neighborhood of t = 0 [observe Eqs. (B9) and (B10)]. Equation (16) holds, then, if b is sufficiently
large, (1/τb1 ) f1 (t/τb1 ) can be considered a delta function. The integrals I1 and I3 become zero, and the integrals
involving t = 0 in the expression of I2 converge to one. I2 becomes
I2 =

(B16)

The same argument can be used when b is such that
τ2 ≪ bt> ≪ τ3 . After such changes in the time scale, the
diffusion coefficient Γ = Γ0 + Γ1 is enlarged, and the nondiffusive contributions are reduced. There is an ultimate
scale change, such that τΛ ≪ bt> . Beyond this maximum
