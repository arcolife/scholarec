Abstract. We give a new derivation of the minimal velocity estimates [SiSo1] for unitary evolutions.
Let H and A be selfadjoint operators on a Hilbert space H. The starting point is Mourre’s inequality
i[H, A] ≥ θ > 0, which is supposed to hold in form sense on the spectral subspace H∆ of H for
(k)
some interval ∆ ⊂ R. The second assumption is that the multiple commutators adA (H) are wellbehaved for k = 1 . . . n (n ≥ 2) . Then we show that, for a dense set of ψ’s in H∆ and all m < n−1 ,
ψt = exp(−iHt) is contained in the spectral subspace A ≥ θt as t → ∞, up to an error of order
t−m in norm. We apply this general result to the case where H is a Schr¨odinger operator on √
Rn
and A the dilation generator, proving that ψt (x) is asymptotically supported in the set |x| ≥ t θ
up to an error of order t−m in norm.

INTRODUCTION

Before posing the problem in abstract form we describe it in its original concrete setting. Consider the
Schr¨odinger equation

1 2
p + V (x) on L2 (Rn )
(1.1)
2
for a particle in Rn under the influence of a potential V (x). We are interested in the long–time behavior of
i∂t ψt = Hψt ;

H=

orbits t → ψt in the continuous spectral subspace Hc of H. Under mild conditions on V , H is selfadjoint

and

p2
for some constant c ∈ R. Here Φ

ψ

ψ

≤ const. H + c

ψ

(1.2)

= (ψ, Φψ) denotes the expectation value of an observable Φ in the state

ψ. By Ruelle’s theorem ([Rue], see also [CFKS], [HuSi1]) any orbit ψt in Hc is escaping in a mean ergodic

sense :

dx |ψt (x)|2 = 0

(1.3)

for any finite R. The question is : how fast ? The answer will of course depend on the initial state ψ. The
simplest example is the free particle (V = 0): if the Fourier transform ψ of ψ is smooth and supported
outside some ball of radius v > 0, then a standard asymptotic expansion gives the result
|x|≤vt

dx |ψt (x)|2 = O(t−m ) (t → ∞)

(1.4)

for any m. In this sense the orbits ψt of the given type are said to have a minimal escape velocity v given by
the support of ψ. To obtain a similar result for V = 0 we study the long–time behavior of the expectation
values A

(1.5)

Mourre’s very fruitful idea [Mou] was to find observables A such that the commutator in (1.5) is conditionally
positive , in the sense that
E∆ i[H, A] E∆ ≥ θ E∆

(θ > 0)

(1.6)

for some interval ∆ ⊂ R, where E∆ is the corresponding spectral projection of H. This implies that
A

t

≥ θ t + O(1) → ∞

(t → ∞)

(1.7)

for orbits ψt in the spectral subspace H∆ = Ran E∆ . Evidently A must be unbounded, so that domain
questions arise. Also H∆ must be a subspace of Hc since A

t

is constant and i[H, A]

ψ

= 0 for any

eigenvector ψ of H. (1.6) is a special case of a more general inequality due to Mourre, which was first proven
for Schr¨odinger operators (including N –body systems), where A was taken as the dilation generator :
A =

1
(p · x + x · p) ;
2

i[H, A] = p2 − x · ∇V (x)

(1.8)

([Mou], [PSS], see also [CFKS], [HuSi1]). In this case the intervals ∆ for which (1.6) holds fill the continous
spectrum of H, in the sense that the corresponding subspaces H∆ span Hc . Moreover, since
1
A = i [H, x2 ]
2
is itself a commutator, (1.5) can be written as ∂t 2 x2
x2

t

t

(1.9)

≥ 2θ for orbits ψt in H∆ , which implies that

≥ θ t2 + O(t)

(t → ∞) .

(1.10)

This is of course weaker than (1.4) : it only says that the mean value of x2 for the probability distribution
|ψt (x)|2 diverges like θ t2 , whereas we want to prove that the support of this distribution is asymptotically
√
contained in |x| ≥ t θ as t → ∞ . The first step is to derive a corresponding result for the spectral support

of ψt with respect to A. We state this result in abstract form for a pair (H , A) of selfdjoint operators on a
Hilbert space H.
(k)

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that adA (f (H)) is bounded for any f ∈ C0∞ (R) and k = 1 . . . n, n ≥ 2, and that

the Mourre inequality (1.6) holds for some open interval ∆ ⊂ R. Let χ± be the characteristic function of

R± . Then

χ− (A − a − ϑt)e−iHt g(H)χ+ (A − a) ≤ const. t−m

(1.11)

for any g ∈ C0∞ (∆), any ϑ in 0 < ϑ < θ and any m < n − 1, uniformly in a ∈ R .
Since g ∈ C0∞ (∆) and a ∈ R are arbitrary, the vectors of the form
ψ = g(H) χ+ (A − a)ϕ;

ϕ∈H

(1.12)

are dense in H∆ . (1.11) says that, for any such ψ, ψt = exp(−iHt)ψ has spectral support in [ t ϑ , +∞) with

respect to A , up to a remainder of order t−m in norm.

(k)

Commutators. The hypothesis adA (f (H)) ∈ L(H) may be replaced by conditions on adA (H) which are
more subtle to formulate since the operators A and H are generally unbounded (see e.g. [ABG], [JMP]). For

the special case (1.8) this is further discussed below.
Resolvent smoothness and local decay. We indicate briefly how minimal velocity estimates are related to
resolvent smoothness [JMP] and to local decay [PSS]. Let ρ(A) = (1 + A2 )1/2 . Setting a = −θt/2 and using
that

ρ(A)−α = ρ(A)−α χ± (A ± ct) + O(t−α ) ,
we obtain from (1.11)
ρ(A)−α e−iHt g(H)ρ(A)−α ≤ const. (1 + t)− min(α,m) .
For α, m > 1 this is integrable over −∞ < t < +∞ , which (by Fourier transform) leads to the resolvent
estimate

sup ρ(A)−α (z − H)−1 g(H)ρ(A)−α ≤ ∞ .

(1.13)

z ∈R
/

Similar estimates for the derivatives with respect to z (higher powers) of the resolvent (z −H)−1 are obtained

using correspondingly higher values of α, m (resolvent smoothness). Replacing g by g 2 in (1.13) it also follows
that the operator ρ(A)−α is H–smooth for α > 1 and therefore ([RSIV] Theorem XIII.25 and corollary)

(1.14)

where ∆′ is any fixed compact subset of ∆ (local decay). By an independent argument of Mourre (given in
[PSS]) the estimate (1.13) and therefore (1.14) can be improved from α > 1 to α > 1/2.
Our second result is an application of Theorem 1.1 to the Schr¨odinger equation (1.1). Here A is given by
(1.8), and
(k)

ik adA (H) = 2k−1 p2 + (−x · ∇)k V (x) .

(1.15)

A simple way to satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1 in this case is to assume that V has relative bound
less than 1 with respect to 21 p2 , and that the distributions (x · ∇)k V (x) are locally L2 and (as multiplications

operators) bounded relative to p2 for k = 1 . . . n. Then the operators (1.15) are bounded relative to H and it
(k)

is straightforward to compute and to estimate the the norms of adA ((z − H)−1 ) for Im(z) = 0. Representing

f (H) by the resolvent (z − H)−1 (e.g. using the Helffer-Sj¨ostrand formula ([HeSj], [Dav]) it then follows
(k)

that adA (f (H)) is bounded for k = 1 . . . n. The result is that fast decay (large m) in (1.11) must be paid
for by high smoothness of V (x) for all x. This is unnatural, and in fact there is a better way to construct A

which requires only smoothness of V (x) for arbitray large |x|. The idea is to replace x2 in (1.9) by a smooth,

convex function G(x) which is equal to x2 for large |x| but constant in some abitrary large ball |x| ≤ R.

Then A changes to

A=

1
(∇G(x) · p + p · ∇G(x)) ,

(k)

and the Mourre inequality can be established as before. Then the operators adA (p2 ) remain second order
in p with bounded coefficients, while
(k)

ik adA (V ) = (−∇G(x) · ∇)k V (x)
requires only derivatives of V (x) in the region |x| > R. A more carful construction of G(x) due to Graf

[Gra1] is specially adapted to the N -body case, requiring only smoothness of the pair potentials for large
separations (see [Skib], [Gri]). The following result can also be proven in this more general setting.
Theorem 1.2. Let H and A be given by (1.1) and (1.8). Then, under the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1 ,
χ− (x2 − 2at − ϑ t2 ) e−iHt g(H) χ+ (A − a) ≤ const. t−m

(1.16)

for any ϑ in 0 < ϑ < θ, any m < n − 1 and any a ∈ R.
We remark that for initial states of the form (1.13) this is equivalent to

The proofs of these results are given in section 2. The main tool is the method of commutator expansions
summarized in section 3.
We conclude the introduction with some (not exhaustive) bibliographical notes. Minimal velocity estimates
were first given by Sigal and Soffer [SiSo1] and then extended by Skibsted [Ski] and by G´erard and Sigal [GeSi],
with applications to scattering theory ([SiSo2], [Sig], [HeSk]) and to the theory of resonances ([GeSi], [SoWe],
[Nier]). Our derivation is similar in spirit to [Ski] and incorporates remarks by Froese and Loss [FrLo]. The
related subject of resolvent smoothness and local decay is more fully treated by time–independent methods
e.g. in [PSS], [JMP] and [GIS], where further references can be found. The generalization of Mourre’s
theorem using the construction of Graf [Gra1] first appears in [Ski]. A simpler proof due to Graf [Gra2] is
given in [Gri]. For other applications of Mourre’s inequality to wave equations and spectral geometry see
e.g. [DHS], [DBiPr], [FHP].

PROOFS

The following lemma gives the basic estimate for a proof by bootstrap of Theorem 1.1. A smooth function
f on R is said to be of order p if for each k
|f (k) (x)| ≤ const. |x|p−k .
Lemma 2.1. Suppose that A, H and g satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1. Let f be a positive C ∞ function on R of order < 4 with f ′ ≤ 0 and f (x) = 0 for x ≥ 0. Let 1 ≤ s < ∞; a ∈ R, As = s−1 (A − a),

and ε ≤ 1. Then

g(H)i[H, f (As )]g(H) ≤ s−1 θg(H)f ′ (As )g(H)

+ s−(1+ε) g(H)f1 (As )g(H)

+ const. s−(2n−1−ε) g 2 (H)
4

(2.1)

uniformly in a ∈ R, where f1 is a function on R which again satisfies the hypothesis stated for f .
Proof. In the commutator i[H, f (As )] occurring in (2.1) we can replace H by a bounded operator
Hb = H b(H)

(2.2)

where b ∈ C0∞ (R); b ≡ 1 on supp(g). Then the commutators
(k)

Bk = i adA (Hb ) ,

k = 1...n ,

are bounded by hypothesis. As a first step we show that
i[Hb , f (As )] = −s−1 (−f ′ (As ))1/2 B1 (−f ′ (As ))1/2 + remainder .

(2.3)

Here and in the rest of the proof a remainder is defined as a quadratic form rem(s) with an estimate
±rem(s) ≤ s−(1+ε) f1 (As ) + const. s−(2n−1−ε) ,

(2.4)

uniformly in a, where f1 is a function on R satisfying the hypothesis for f . Any such remainder clearly
fits into (2.1) and needs no further consideration. To prove (2.3) we factorize f = F 2 and then expand the
commutator

i[Hb , f ] = i[Hb , F ]F + F i[Hb , F ]

(RF + F R∗ )

using (3.1). Since n ≥ 2 and since F is of order < 2 it follows from (3.2) that R is bounded uniformly in

s and a. Now we observe that all the terms in the expansion (2.5) except the leading term (k = 1) are
remainders. In particular
|(ψ, F (k) Bk F ψ)| ≤ Bk

F (k) ψ

F ψ ≤ const. (ψ, f1 ψ),

(2.6)

where f1 is a common upper bound for F 2 = f and (F (k) )2 which satisfies the hypothesis for f . The last
term in (2.5) is estimated using the operator inequality
±(P ∗ Q + Q∗ P ) ≤ P ∗ P + Q∗ Q

for Q = s− 2 (1+ε) F ; P ∗ = s−n+ 2 (1+ε) R, with the result
±s−n (RF + F R∗ ) ≤ s−(1+ε) f + s−(2n−1−ε) R

2

.

(2.7)

Therefore it remains to consider the leading term (k = 1) in (2.5), which is rewritten as
s−1 (F ′ B1 F + F B1 F ′ ) = −s−1 (v 2 B1 u2 + u2 B1 v 2 )
by factorizing F = u2 , −F ′ = v 2 . Since u is of order < 1 it follows from (3.2) that [B1 , u] ≤ const. s−1

uniformly in a, and similarly for [B1 , v]. As in (2.6) this leads to the form estimate
s−1 |v 2 B1 u2 − uvB1 uv| = s−1 |v[B1 , u]uv + v[v, B1 ]u2 |
≤ const. s−2 (v 2 + u2 v 2 + u4 ) ≤ const. s−2 f1 (As ) ,
5

where f1 shares the properties of f = u4 (note that v is of lower order than u). Since the same estimate
holds with u and v interchanged, we conclude that
s−1 (F ′ B1 F + F B1 F ′ ) = −2s−1 uv B1 uv
plus a remainder. (2.3) now follows since f ′ = 2F F ′ = −2(uv)2 .
To complete the proof of Lemma 2.1. we multiply (2.3) from both sides with g(H) = g(H)G(H), where
G ∈ C0∞ (∆) is real and G ≡ 1 on supp(g). We also adjust the function b in (2.2) such that b ≡ 1 on supp(G).
Multiplying (1.6) by G(H) from both sides we obtain the Mourre inequality :
G(H)B1 G(H) = G(H)i[H, A]G(H) ≥ θ G2 (H).

(2.8)

Abbreviating G(H) = G and (−f ′ (As ))1/2 = j we show that
s−1 GjBjG − s−1 jGBGj = s−1 jGB[j, G] + [G, j]BGj + [G, j]B[j, G]

(2.9)

is a remainder for any bounded B = B ∗ , using for [G, j] the expansion
n−1

[G, j] =

1 −k (k)
(k)
s j (A) adA (G) + s−n R
k!

(k)

and its adjoint for [j, G]. Since adA (G) is bounded for k ≤ n, the right hand side of (2.9) then becomes a

sum of terms of the following types :
(a)

s−(k+l+1) j (k) C j (l) + j (l) C ∗ j (k) ;

(0 ≤ k, l ≤ n − 1; k + l ≥ 1);

(b)

s−(k+n+1) j (k) C + C ∗ j (k) ;

(0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1);

(c)

s−(2n+1) C,

where in each case C stands for some operator which is bounded uniformly in a and s. By the same arguments
as in (2.6) and (2.7) these terms have corresponding upper and lower bounds

(a)

± s−2 2 C

(b)

± s−2 j (k)2 + s−2n C

(c)

j (k)2 + j (l)2 ;
2

;

± s−(2n+1) C .

For any bounded B = B ∗ we therefore obtain
s−1 GjBjG ∼
= s−1 jGBGj ,

(2.10)

meaning that the difference of the two expresssions is a remainder (2.4). For B = B1 = i[Hb , A] we use
Mourre’s inequality (2.8) to obtain from (2.3) :
G i[H, f ] G ∼
= −s−1 Gj B1 jG ∼
= −s−1 jG B1 Gj
≤ −s−1 θjG2 j ∼
= −s−1 θGj 2 G
= s−1 θGf ′ G ,
6

with remainders arising from (2.3) and twice from (2.10). Multiplying from both sides with g(H) removes
G(H) and leads directly to (2.1).
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We prove a slightly stronger version of (1.11), which will serve later in the proof
of Theorem 1.2. Let
Ats = s−1 (A − a − θt) ,
and suppose that F is a positive C ∞ -function of order ≤ 1/2 on R with F ′ ≤ 0 and F (x) = 0 for x ≥ 0.

Instead of (1.11) we show under the same hypothesis that

F (Ats )eiHt g(H)χ+ (A − a) ≤ const. s−m

(2.11)

for m < n − 1, uniformly in 0 ≤ t ≤ s and in a ∈ R. (1.11) then follows by setting t = s and by observing
that, since ϑ < θ, χ− (s−1 (A − a) − ϑ) ≤ F (s−1 (A − a) − θ) for some F of the required type. To prove (2.11)

we consider the operator

φs (t) = g(H)f (Ats )g(H) ; f = F 2 ,
and the evolution
ψt = e−iHt χ+ (A − a)ϕ ; ϕ ∈ H .

(2.12)

Then the estimate (2.11) to be proved reads
φs (t)

t

= (ψt , φs (t)ψt ) ≤ const. ϕ 2 s−2m ,

(2.13)

uniformly in 1 < s , 0 ≤ t ≤ s and in a ∈ R. We compute
∂t φs (t)

t

= (ψt , Dt φs (t)ψt ) ;

(2.14)

Dt φs (t) = i[H, φs (t)] + ∂t φs (t)
= g(H)i[H, f (Ats )]g(H) − s−1 θg(H)f ′ (Ats )g(H) .

(2.15)

First we conclude that
Dt φs (t) ≤ const.

(2.16)

uniformly in s, t, a, since f is of order ≤ 1. (cf. the remark after (3.4)). Secondly, by (3.8),
φs (0)

F (s−1 (A − a))g(H)χ+ (A − a)

(2.17)

Integrating (2.14) over t and using (2.16) and (2.17) we find the crude estimate
φs (t)

t

≤ const. ϕ 2 (s−2n + s)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ s, which proves (2.13) for m = −1/2. Now we bootstrap this estimate. First we note that by
(2.15) and Lemma 2.1

Dt φs (t) ≤ s−1−ε g(H)f1 (Ast )g(H) + const. s−(2n−1−ε) g 2 (H) .
7

(2.18)

As an induction assumption, suppose that (2.13) holds for some m < n − 1. Since f1 also satisfies the

hypothesis for f it then follows from (2.18) that

2

| Dt φs (t) t | ≤ const. ϕ

· s−1 s−(2m+ε) + s−(2(n−1)−ε ,

and again by integrating over t :
φs (t)

t

≤ const. ϕ

s−2n + s−(2m+ε) + s−(2(n−1)−ε)

2

uniformly in 0 ≤ t ≤ s and in a ∈ R. Recalling that ε ≤ 1, the best decay for s → ∞ is obtained by setting
ε = min 1, (n − 1) − m ,
which boosts the exponent m in (2.13) to m′ = m + ε/2. Therefore (2.13) holds for any m < n − 1.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. It suffices to prove that
χ(t−2 x2 − 2t−1 a − ϑ)e−iHt g(H)χ+ (A − a) ≤ const. t−m

(2.19)

if χ is a smoothed characteristic function of (−∞, −ε) for some ε > 0 : χ(x) = 1 for large negative x, χ′ ≤ 0,

and χ(x) = 0 for x ≥ −ε. Following the line of the previous proof we consider the operators
φs (t) = f (x2ts ); f = χ2 ; x2ts =

1 2
(x − 2at − ϑt2 )
s2

(2.20)

and the evolution
ψt = e−iHt g(H)χ+ (A − a)ϕ , ϕ ∈ H ,

(2.21)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ s. The desired inequality (2.19) then reads
φs (s)

s

≤ const. s−2m .

(2.22)

Writing x2 − 2at − ϑ2 = (x − a)2 − (a2 + ϑ)t2 we see that
φs (t) = 0

8

(2.23)

we arrive at
Dt φs (t) = −2ts−2 u(x2ts )(t−1 (A − a) − ϑ)u(x2ts ) .

(2.24)

Now we use ϑ < θ to estimate
−(t−1 (A − a) − ϑ) ≤ −(t−1 (A − a) − ϑ)χ− (t−1 (A − a) − ϑ)
≤ F (t−1 (A − a) − θ)

by some smooth function F of order 1/2 supported in R− and with F ′ ≤ 0. Setting At = t−1 (A − a) − θ we
find

Dt φs (t)

t

≤ 2ts−2 F (At )u(x2ts )eiHt g(H)χ+ (A − a)ϕ

(2.25)

On the other hand, it follows from (2.11) by setting t = s that
F (At )eiHt g(X)χ+ (A − a) ≤ const. t−m .

(2.26)

Before we can use this estimate in (2.25) we must commute the factor u(x2ts ) to the left. The required
commutator can be expanded to any order n :

(k)

and so forth, with the result that adA (u) ≤ const. uniformly in 1 ≤ s < ∞ and 0 ≤ t ≤ s. Since (2.26)

also holds if F is replaced by a derivative F (k) , we find the estimate

COMMUTATOR EXPANSIONS

Let H and A be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H and suppose that H is bounded. To say that
the commutor i[H, A] is bounded means that the quadratic form

i[(Hψ, Aψ) − (Aψ, Hψ)]
9

on D(A) is bounded and thus defines a bounded, symmetric operator called i[H, A]. In the same sense we
assume that the higher commutators
(k)

(k−1)

adA (H) = [adA

(H) , A]

are bounded for k = 2 . . . n. Let f be a real C ∞ –function on R. Then, under a further condition given
below, the commutator [H, f (A)] has an expansion

The further condition on f is that the integrals (3.2) exist. The number cn is a numerical constant depending
on n but not on f , A or H. In particular, the expansion (3.1) holds if
f (k) (x) = O(|x|n−ε−k )

for k = 1 · · · n + 2, i.e. if the function f (x) grows not faster than |x|n−ε , with corresponding slower growth

of the successive derivatives. We will refer to (3.3) by saying that f is of order n − ε. In that case (3.1) is
defined in form sense on the domain of f (1) (A). Taking the adjoint of (3.1) and noting that

we also obtain

(3.4)

This defines [H, f (A)] as an operator on the domain of f (1) (A) = f ′ (A). In particular, if f is of order ≤ 1

and n ≥ 2, then [H, f (A)] is bounded. In the general case where H is not bounded, we will work with
operators g(H), g ∈ C0∞ (R), assuming that
(k)

adA (g(H)) is bounded for k = 1 · · · n .

(3.5)

Then, if f is of order < n,

[g(H), f (A)] =

with a constant depending on f and n, and similarly for the adjoint expansion. All these formulas are
particularly useful if the role of A is played by a scaled operator, say s−1 A, 0 < s < ∞. Then the commutor

expansions are expansions in powers of s−1 , e.g.
n−1

[g(H), f (s−1 A)] =
k=1

A simple but useful observation is the following. Suppose that f (x) = 0 for x ∈ R+ , and let χ+ be the

characteristic function of R+ . Then

χ+ (A)g(H)f (s−1 A) ≤ const. s−n .

(3.8)

Proof. Since χ+ (A)f (s−1 A) = 0 we have
χ+ (A)g(H)f (s−1 A) = χ+ (A)[g(H), f (s−1 A)] .
Inserting the expansion (3.7) we notice that only the remainder s−n Rn contributes, since
χ+ (A)f (k) (A) = 0.
Commutator expansions of this type were introduced in [SiSo1] and have since become an important tool
of operator analysis. There are several versions ([SiSo1], [Ski], [IvSi], [ABG]) which differ in the form of
the remainder estimate. The results above are derived in [HuSi2] and are based on the Helffer-Sj¨ostrand
functional calculus ([HeSj], [Dav]).
