1. Introduction
Let Σ be a closed surface with area 1. The Moser-Trudinger inequality is
Σ

|∇u|2 + 8π

Σ

u − 8π log

Σ

eu > −C, for any u ∈ H 1 (Σ),
(1.1)

for some constant C > 0. ((1.1) is a slightly weaker form of the original
Moser-Trudinger inequality , see [41, 43, 25, 15, 38].) The inequality
(1.1) has been extensively used in many mathematical and physical
problems, for instance, in the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature [7, 8, 11, 9], the mean field equation [5, 6, 31, 18, 42], the model of
chemotaxis [46, 28] and the relativistic Abelian Chern-Simons model
[27, 29, 4, 44, 16, 17, 19, 38], etc. In all such problems, the corresponding equation is similar to the Liouville equation

(1.2)
− ∆u = M0 (

The system-analog of (1.2) is the following system of equations

1 ≤ i ≤ n,

(1.3)

for a coefficient matrix A = (aij )n×n . Here Mi > 0 ( i = 1, 2, · · · , n)
are prescribed constants. When the coefficient matrix admits only
nonnegative entries, there is a generalized Moser-Trudinger inequality
obtained in [13, 45]
Theorem 1.1. [13, 45] Let the coefficient matrix A be a positive definite matrix with nonnegative entries. If for any subset J ⊆ I :=
{1, 2, · · · , n}

In fact, the condition that A is positive definite can be removed by
using another formulation of the functional JM , see [13, 45]. Theorem
1.1 is sharp in the sense that if there is a subset J ⊆ I with ΛJ (M) < 0,
then inf u∈(H 1 Σ))n JM (u) = −∞. When n = 1, the condition (1.4) is
equivalent to a11 M1 < 8π. Therefore, it is natural to conjecture [45]
that Theorem 1.1 holds if and only if
ΛJ (M) ≥ 0, for any J ⊆ I.

(1.6)

In [45], a proof of this conjecture was sketched for a special, but interesting case.
Theorem 1.2. Let A be a symmetric, positive definite row stochastic
matrix, i.e.,
n

aij = 1 for any i ∈ I.

aij ≥ 0 and

(1.7)

j=1

Then there is a constant C > 0 such that
JM (u) ≥ −C

for any u ∈ (H 1 (Σ))n

if and only if (1.6) holds.
The “only if” part was first proved in [13] in a more general case. It is
clear that in general, such an inequality cannot be true if the coefficient
matrix A admits some negative entries. However, in many interesting
systems arising in Physics and Differential Geometry, there are negative
coefficients, for instance, in the Toda system and the relativistic and
nonrelativistic non-Abelian Chern-Simons models [32, 20, 24, 26].
In this paper, we want to generalize Theorem 1.2 to the Toda system.

The open SU(N + 1) Toda system (or, 2-dimensional Toda lattice) is

− ∆ui =

(1.8)

j=1

The popular interpretation of the (one-dimensional) Toda lattice is a
Hamiltonian system which describes the motion of N particles moving
in a straight line, with “exponential interaction”. The two-dimensional
Toda system has a much closer relationship with differential geometry.
It can be seen as the Frenet frame of holomorphic curves into CPN .
For the Toda system and its geometric interpretation see, e.g.,[26] and
references therein. See also [20].
In this paper, we establish the following Moser-Trudinger type inequality for (1.8).
Theorem 1.3. Let Σ be a closed surface with area 1 and A = K.
Define a functional ΦN : (H 1 (Σ))N → R by
ΦM (u) =

2 i,j=1

N

Then, the functional has a lower bound if and only if
Mj ≤ 4π,

for j = 1, 2, · · · , N.

(1.9)

We remark that the condition (1.9) is equivalent to (1.6) in this
case. Since the coefficient matrix K admits negative entries, we might
encounter the problem that the maximum principle fails. This is the
reason why we cannot classify all entire solutions of (1.8) with finite
energy yet∗ (see Sections 2 and 7). Fortunately, when proving Theorem
1.3 we can avoid this problem.
We outline our main idea of the proof of Theorem 1.3 for N = 2. We
first show that ΦM has a lower bound if Mj < 4π for j = 1, 2 (Theorem
4.1). The idea is as follows. Let us define
Λ = {M = (M1 , M2 ) ∈ R+ × R+ | inf ΦM > −∞}.
From the ordinary Moser-Trudinger inequality (1.1), we know Λ = ∅.
Theorem 4.1 now is equivalent to (0, 4π) × (0, 4π) ⊆ Λ. If it were false
then there exists M 0 = (M10 , M20 ) such that M ǫ = (M10 −ǫ, M20 −ǫ) ∈ Λ,
∗

We are able to classify all such solutions now.

ANALYTIC ASPECTS OF THE TODA SYSTEM I

but (M10 + ǫ, M20 + ǫ) ∈ Λ for any small ǫ > 0. It is easy to show
that ΦM ǫ admits a minimizer uǫ = (uǫ1 , uǫ2 ) which satisfies (1.3) for
M ǫ = (M10 − ǫ, M20 − ǫ). If uǫ blows up, there are three cases (see
Section 4 below). For each case, after rescaling we obtain a “bubble”
which is an entire solution of the Liouville equation (3.6) or the Toda
system (1.8) with finite energy. A classification result of [12] for the
Liouville equation and Corollary 2.6 below imply that in any case one
of M10 and M20 is larger than or equal to 4π, a contradiction. However,
uǫ may not blow up. Ding [14] introduced a trick to deal with such
a problem in his study of the ordinary Moser-Trudinger inequality .
Following his trick, we perturb the functional ΦM ǫ a little bit such that
the resulting functional FM ǫ also admits a minimizer u˜ǫ which does
blow up as ǫ → 0. u˜ǫ satisfies a similar system as (1.3) and has the
same “bubble”. Then we are able to use the argument above to get a
contradiction.
To prove Theorem 1.3, we consider the sequence of minimizers uǫ =
(uǫ1, uǫ2 ) of ΦM ǫ with M ǫ = M 0 − (ǫ, ǫ) = (4π − ǫ, 4π − ǫ) for small
ǫ > 0. (The existence of the uǫ follows from Theorem 4.1.) uǫ satisfies
a Toda type system. If uǫ converges u0 in H2 := H 1 × H 1 , then
it is clear that inf u∈H2 ΦM 0 (u) = ΦM 0 (u0 ) > −∞. Hence, we may
assume uǫ does not converge in H2 . Using the analysis developed in
Sections 2 and 3, we know there are three possibilities: (a) |S1 |1 and
S2 = ∅, (b) |S1 | = |S2 | = 1 and S1 = S2 and (c) |S1 | = |S2 | = 1
and S1 ∩ S2 = ∅. Here Sj (j = 1, 2) is the blow-up set defined in
Section 5 below and |S| is the number of points of the finite set S.
We use a “local” Pohozaev identity to exclude case (b). This is the
crucial point to avoid the aforementioned problem that the maximum
principle fails, since the remaining cases are essentially scalar problems.
In fact, we can reduce case (a) directly to the corresponding problem
of one function-the ordinary Moser-Trudinger inequality. For case (b),
we can apply the method developed in [15, 38] to give a lower bounded
of ΦM 0 .
We shall apply Theorem 1.3 in a forthcoming paper [30] to study the
relativistic SU(N + 1) non-Abelian Chern-Simons model ([32, 34, 35,

20]), which can be seen as a non-integrable perturbation of the integrable Toda system (1.8). For mathematical aspects of the relativistic
non-Abelian Chern-Simons model, see [49, 47]† . We hope Theorem 1.3
will become a powerful tool for studying problems arising from higher
rank models, as the ordinary Moser-Trudinger inequality has become
in the Abelian case.
For simplicity we only give detailed proofs for the case N = 2. The
proofs in case N > 2 are completely analogous and just require a more
complicated notation. In Section 2, we analyze the solutions of (1.8)
in R2 and obtain a relation between R2 eu1 and R2 eu2 for any entire
solutions of (1.8). In Section 3, we analyze the convergence of solutions
as in [3]. In Section 4, we first show ΦM has a lower bound if Mj < 4π
for all j. Then we show that if ΦM has a lower bound, Mj ≤ 4π for all
j. We prove Theorem 1.3 in Section 5.
2. Analysis of the Toda system

system



− ∆u1 = 2eu1 − eu2 ,
 −∆u2 = −eu1 + 2eu2 ,

(2.1)

which is equivalent to system (1.8) with N = 2. Similar results were
obtained in [3, 12] for the Liouville equation and in [10, 13] for the
Liouville type systems, see also [36].

and αj = R2 euj for j = 1, 2. Set u˜1 = u1 − 2w1 + w2 and u˜2 =
u2 − 2w2 + w1 . Clearly ∆˜
uj = 0 in R2 . By Lemma 2.4 below and
Lemma 2.2, u˜j (j = 1, 2) is bounded from above. Thus, u˜ ≡ cj for
some constants c1 and c2 . Now the Lemma follows from Lemma 2.5
and (2.9) below.
✷
Using potential analysis as in [12], we have
Lemma 2.4. For any small ǫ > 0, there is a constant cǫ > 0 such that
− (αj + ǫ) log |x| − cǫ ≤ wj (x) ≤ −(αj − ǫ) log |x| + cǫ , for any x ∈ R2 .
(2.8)
Proof. See [12].

✷

Lemma 2.5. β1 := 2α1 − α2 > 4π and β2 := 2α2 − α1 > 4π.
Proof.
The previous Lemma implies that
− (2α1 − α2 + ǫ) log |x| − cǫ ≤ 2w1(x) − w2 (x) ≤ −(2α1 − α2 − ǫ) log |x| + cǫ
(2.9)
Since u1 = 2w1 −w2 + c1 , from (2.9) and (2.8), we deduce that β1 > 4π.
Similarly, we have β2 > 4π.

Corollary 2.6. αj > 4π for j = 1, 2.

which is equivalent to (2.11). This proves the Lemma.

✷

Similar results for systems with non-negative entries were obtained
in [10] and [13]. We conjecture that α1 = α2 = 8π. It is also very
interesting to classify all solutions of (2.1) with finite energy R2 euj <
∞ for j = 1, 2. When solutions have suitable decay near infinity such
that they can be seen as functions on S2 , the classification was obtained
by differential geometers and physicists, see [23, 20]. In fact, in this
case, all solutions can been seen as minimal immersions from S2 to CP2
which are deformations of the Veronese immersion by the action of the
group P GL(3, C), see [23, 2, 48].
3. Convergence of solutions
In this section, we consider the convergence of solutions of the Toda
system. We follow the method developed in [3], but we need to be
careful with the use of the maximum principle, since the coefficient
matrix has some negative entries.
For simplicity, we only consider the system on the bounded domain
Ω. We have
Theorem 3.1. Let uk = (uk1 , uk2 ) be a sequence of solutions of the following system

for some constant C > 0 and p > 1. Let
Sj = {x ∈ Σ|there is a sequence y ǫ → x such that uǫj (y ǫ ) → +∞}.
(3.3)
Then, one of the following possibilities happens: (after taking subsequences)
∞
(1) uk is bounded in L∞
loc (Ω) × Lloc (Ω).

ANALYTIC ASPECTS OF THE TODA SYSTEM I

k
(2) For some j ∈ {1, 2}, uki in L∞
loc (Ω), but uj → −∞ uniformly on
any compact subset of Ω for j = i.
(3) For some i ∈ {1, 2}, Si = ∅, but Sj = ∅, for j = i. In this
case, uki → −∞ on any compact subset of Ω\Si , and either, ukj is
k
bounded in L∞
loc (Ω), or uj → −∞ on any compact subset of Ω.
(4) S1 = ∅ and S2 = ∅. Moreover, ukj is either bounded or → −∞ on
any compact subset of Ω\(S1 ∪ Σ2 ) for j = 1, 2.

Proof. Here, for simplicity we only give a proof of the Theorem when
ψ1k = ψ2k = 0.
In view of (3.2), we may assume that there exist two nonnegative
bounded measures µ1 and µ2 such that
k

euj ψ →

ψdµj as k → ∞,

for every smooth function ψ with support in Ω and j = 1, 2. A point
x ∈ Ω is called a γ-regular point with respect to µj if there is a function
ψ ∈ Cc (Ω) , 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1, with ψ = 1 in a neighborhood of x such that
Ω

ψdµj < γ.

We define
Ωj (γ) = {x ∈ Ω | x is not a γ−regular point with respect to µj }.
By definition and (3.2), it is clear that Ω1 (γ) and Ω2 (γ) are finite. And
Ωj (γ) is independent of γ for small γ > 0, see below. We divide the
proof into 3 steps.
Step 1. For j = 1, 2, Sj = Ωj (γ) provided γ <

4π
.
3

First from Lemma 2.2, we know that for any point x ∈ Ω\(Ω1 (γ) ∪
Ω2 (γ)), there is some r0 such that
+

ukj is bounded in L∞ (Br0 (x)) for j = 1, 2.

(3.4)

Here u+ = max{u, 0}. The argument in [3] implies directly that
S1 ∪ S2 = Ω1 (γ) ∪ Ω2 (γ).
Hence, S1 and S2 are both finite. Let x0 ∈ S1 . Assume by contradiction
k
that x0 ∈ Ω1 . Thus, Bδ (x0 ) eu1 ≤ γ for any small constant δ > 0. Note

that −∆u1k = 2eu1 − eu2 ≤ 2eu1 . Define w : Bδ (x0 ) → R by

The maximum principle implies that uk1 ≤ w. Since S1 is finite, we
+
may assume that uk1 is uniformly bounded in L∞ (∂Bδ (x0 )). In view
k
of Bδ (x0 ) eu1 ≤ γ < 4π
, a result of Brezis and Merle [3] implies that
3

w ∈ L (B δ (x0 )), which in turn implies that uk1 ∈ L∞ (B δ (x0 )),
2
2
a contradiction. Hence, S1 ⊂ Ω1 (γ). Ω1 (γ) ⊂ S1 follows from the
argument in [3]. Similarly, we have S2 = Ω2 (γ).
Step 2. S1 ∪ S2 = ∅ implies (1) and (2). S1 = ∅ and S2 = ∅ imply (4).
S1 ∪ S2 = ∅ means that uǫ1 + and uǫ2 + are bounded in L∞
loc (Ω). Thus,
p
uǫ2
uǫ1
e and e are bounded in Lloc (Ω) for any p > 1, which implies that
µ1 , µ2 ∈ L1 (Ω) ∩ Lploc (Ω). Applying the Harnack inequality as in [3], we
have (1) or (2). The second statement follows similarly.
Step 3. S1 = ∅ and S2 = ∅ imply (3).
We need the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Lemma 2.2 is true for any γ0 < 4π.
Proof. We use a blow-up argument to prove this Lemma. Assume by
contradiction that Lemma 2.2 were false for some γ0 < 4π, i.e., there
exists a sequence of solutions uk = (uk1 , uk2 ) of (2.7) with Ω euj ≤ γ0
(j = 1, 2) for some γ0 < 4π such that
max max{uk1 , uk2 } → ∞, as k → ∞.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that S1 = {x0 } and S2 ∩

by Chen-Li [12], in these two cases limk→∞ Ω eu1 ≥ 4π, which is a
contradiction. This proves the Lemma.

Now we continue to prove Step 3. As in Step 2, we know that either
(i) uk1 is bounded on any subset of Ω\S1 , or
(ii) uk1 → −∞ on any subset of Ω\S1 .

In view of Lemma 3.2, (3) implies that Bδ (p) eu1 ≥ 4π for any p ∈ S1
and any small δ > 0. Now we can follow the argument in [3] to exclude
(i).
✷
Remark 3.3. We believe that in case (4) ukj → −∞ on any compact
subset. ¿From the argument of Step 3, one can show this if S1 = S2 .
In our application (the proof of Theorems 5.1 and 1.3), we can exclude
case (4).
Before we start to prove our main results, we remark that

(2) C denotes a constant independent of ǫ, which may vary from line

(3) Any 2-dimensional surface (Σ, g) is locally conformally flat, i.e.,
for any x ∈ Σ there is a neighborhood x ∈ U ⊂ Σ and a conformal
factor ξ : U → R such that g|U = eξ (dx2 + dy 2) in local coordinates.
Instead of considering the equation −∆g = f in U, we can consider
−∆0 = eξ f in a domain of the Euclidean plane. Hence, wlog, we can
assume ξ =0, i.e., U is a flat domain. In the following sections, we will
assume that near a blow-up point there is a flat neighborhood.

We have the following Moser-Trudinger inequality.
Theorem 4.1. Let Σ be a closed surface with area 1 and A = K. For

inequality and was applied in [45] to obtain a similar inequality for a
system of functions.
Proof. Set
Λ = {(M1 , M2 ) ∈ R+ × R+ |ΦM is bounded from below on H2 }.
Since A is positive definite, it is easy to see that Λ = ∅ from the ordinary
Moser-Trudinger inequality [41, 43]. In fact, one can show easily that

partial order of R+ × R+ , namely, if (M1 , M2 ) ∈ Λ, then (M1′ , M2′ ) ∈ Λ
provided that M1′ ≤ M1 and M2′ ≤ M2 . The Theorem is equivalent to
(0, 4π) × (0, 4π) ⊂ Λ.

Assume by contradiction that (4.4) is false. We may assume that there
is a point

such that
1. For any ǫ > 0, M 0 − ǫ = (M10 − ǫ, M20 − ǫ) ∈ Λ,
2. For any ǫ > 0, M 0 + ǫ = (M10 + ǫ, M20 + ǫ) ∈ Λ.
We first need several lemmas.
Lemma 4.2. For any M with M1 < M10 and M2 < M20 , there exists a
constant c > 0 such that
ΦM (u) ≥ c−1 ( ∇u1

(4.6)

Moreover, ΦM admits a minimizer u = (u1 , u2).
Proof. Choose a small number δ > 0 such that M1 (1 + δ) < M10 and
M2 (1 + δ) < M20 . By the definition of M 0 , we know that (1 + δ)M =
((1 + δ)M1 , (1 + δ)M2 ) ∈ Λ, i.e., there is a constant C > 0 such that

We now continue to prove Theorem 4.1 by considering the sequence
u obtained in the previous Lemma.
We claim that uǫ blows up, i.e.,

Otherwise, we can show that uǫ converges to some u0 in H2 that is a
minimizer of I0 . On the other hand, by Lemma 4.5, I0 has no minimizer,
a contradiction.
Let mǫ = maxx∈Σ max{uǫ1 (x), uǫ2 (x)} = max{uǫ1(xǫ ), uǫ2(xǫ )}. We
have mǫ → ∞ as ǫ → 0. Define a new sequence v ǫ by

consider U as a domain in R2 .) Clearly, u˜ǫ = (˜

Proof. Theorem 4.1 implies that ΦM not only has a lower bound but
also satisfies the coercivity condition. Since ΦM is weakly lower semicontinuous, there is a minimizer that satisfies (4.6) which is the EulerLagrange equation of ΦM .

for any u ∈ H2 ,

(5.3)

where M ǫ = (4π − ǫ, 4π − ǫ) for small constant ǫ > 0.
To show (5.3), first applying Corollary 4.6 we obtain a minimizer

from above uniformly, by using the analysis developed in Section 3
we can show that uǫ converges (by taking subsequences) to u0 in H2
strongly. This implies that inf u∈H2 ΦM 0 (u) = ΦM 0 (u0 ) > −∞, and
hence (5.6). Hence, we assume that

Ωj (γ) = {x ∈ Ω | x is not a γ−regular point with respect to µj }.

Sj = Ωj (γ)

and

|Sj | < ∞ for j = 1, 2,

(5.8)

for any small γ > 0.
Lemma 5.2. |S1 | = 1 and |S2 | ≤ 1.
Proof. By (5.7), we have |S1 | ≥ 1. Let y ∈ S1 and choose δ > 0 so small
that (Bδ (y)\{y}) ∩ (S1 ∪ S2 ) = ∅. One can use the blow-up argument
as in the previous section to show that
lim

ǫ→0 Bδ (y)

ǫ

eu1 ≥ 1,

which implies that S1 = {y} by (5.8), because of (5.4).
Assume by contradiction that |S2 | ≥ 2. Then there exists z ∈ S2
but z = y. Similarly, we can show that there is a small constant δ > 0
satisfying (Bδ (z)\{z}) ∩ (S1 ∪ S2 ) = ∅ and
lim

ǫ→0 Bδ (z)

ǫ

eu2 ≥ 1.

It follows, together with (5.5) that

eu2 = 0.

By (5.8), we have S2 = {z}, a contradiction.

22

(a). |S2 | = 0.
(b). |S2 | = 1 and S1 = S2 ,
(c). |S2 | = 1 and S1 ∩ S2 = ∅,
We discuss the sequence uǫ case by case. We shall show that case
(b) cannot occur, which is crucial to establish our Moser-Trudinger
inequality. Case (a) is easy to handle, while case (c) is more delicate.
Case (a). Reduction to the ordinary Moser-Trudinger inequality .
Let S1 = {p}. In this case, by Theorem 3.1 and similar arguments
given in the proof of Lemma 5.6 in case (c) below, we can show that
2
(a1). uǫ2 converges to G2 in H 1,q (Σ) (q ∈ (1, 2)) and in Cloc
(Σ\{p}),
where G2 satisfies

−∆G2 = 8πeG2 − 4πδp − 4π
with Σ eG2 = 1.
2
(a2). uǫ1 − u¯ǫ1 converges to G1 in H 1,q (Σ) (q ∈ (1, 2)) and in Cloc
(Σ\{p}),
where G1 satisfies
−∆G1 = 8πδp − 4πeG2 − 4π
with

Σ

G1 = 0.

Furthermore, we have the following Lemma.
Lemma 5.3. For any small ǫ > 0 there exists a function wǫ satisfying
− ∆wǫ = 2(4π − ǫ)ehǫ ewǫ − 2(4π − ǫ) in Σ

(5.9)

such that
(i). uǫ1 − wǫ and hǫ are bounded in C 1 (Σ),
(ii). uǫ2 + 21 wǫ − 12 w¯ǫ is bounded in C 1 (Σ).
Proof. For small ǫ > 0, let w
˜ǫ be a function defined by



ǫ

−∆w˜ǫ = (4π − ǫ)eu2 − (4π − ǫ)

˜ǫ = 0
Σw

Since uǫ2 is uniformly bounded from above, w˜ǫ is bounded in C 1 (Σ) by
elliptic estimates. Let wǫ = uǫ1 + w˜ǫ . Clearly, wǫ satisfies (5.9) with
hǫ = −w˜ǫ , which is bounded in C 1 (Σ). By definition, uǫ1 − wǫ = w˜ǫ .

ANALYTIC ASPECTS OF THE TODA SYSTEM I

23

Thus uǫ1 − wǫ is also bounded in C 1 (Σ). In view of (5.9), the function
uǫ2 + 12 wǫ − 2w˜ǫ is harmonic, thus
1
uǫ2 + wǫ − 2w˜ǫ = cǫ ,
2
for some constant cǫ . By (a1), u¯ǫ2 is uniformly bounded. Hence, cǫ − 12 w¯ǫ
is bounded. This proves the Lemma.
✷
We now can reduce our problem to the ordinary Moser-Trudinger
inequality . By Lemma 5.3, we have

case (a).
✷
ΦM ǫ (uǫ ) ≥

Case (b). We show that case (b) does not happen.
Let S1 = S2 = {p}. Wlog, we assume that Bδ (p) is a flat disk for
ǫ
small δ > 0. By Lemma 3.2, in this case, we have that limǫ→0 Bδ (p) eu1 =
1 for any small δ > 0. By the argument in Step 3 in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we have that uǫ1 → −∞ (as ǫ → 0) on any compact subset
of Σ\{p}. We also have either
(i) uǫ2 → −∞ (as ǫ → 0) on any compact subset of Σ\{p}, or
(ii) uǫ2 is uniformly bounded on any compact subset of Σ\{p}.
We first consider case (i). In this case, the same argument given in
the proof of Lemma 5.6 implies
Lemma 5.4. For any q ∈ (1, 2) and j = 1, 2
uǫj − u¯ǫj converges to Gp in H 1,q (Σ),

uǫj − u¯ǫj − Gp → 0, in C 1 (∂Br (p)),

It is clear that, letting ǫ → 0, the left hand side of (5.13) tends to a
number 48π(1 − δ), while the right hand side of (5.13) tends to

which tends to 24π as r → 0, a contradiction. Hence, case (i) does not
happen.
Now we consider case (ii), i.e., uǫ2 is bounded on any compact subset
of Σ\{p}. Let
σ2 = lim lim

ǫ

eu2 .

Since p ∈ S2 = Ω2 (δ) for small δ > 0, we have that 0 < σ2 < 1. As in
the proof of (i), we first have
Lemma 5.5. There exists a function w ∈ C 2 (Σ) with
such that

1. uǫ1 −¯
uǫ1 converges to G1 in H 1,q (Σ)∩Cloc

G1 = 0.

2. uǫ2 − u¯ǫ2 converges to w + G2 in H 1,q (Σ) ∩ Cloc
(Σ\{p}), where G2
satisfies

−∆G2 = 8πew + 4π(σ2 − 1)δp − 4π and

Σ

(G2 + w) = 0.

Then, we apply (5.13) again to get a contradiction. In fact, we can
show that in this case its left hand tends to 24π(1 + σ2 ) while its right
hand tends 24π(σ22 − σ2 + 1), which is impossible if 0 < σ2 < 1. This
implies that case (ii), hence case (b), does not happen either.
Such an argument, using a“local” Pohozaev identity, was used in [46]
and [50] for studying the blow up of Liouville type equations.
Case (c). This case is more delicate.
Set S1 = {p1 } and S2 = {p2 }. Note that p1 = p2 . In view of Theorem
3.1 and the blow-up argument given above, uǫj (j = 1, 2) tends to −∞
uniformly on any compact subset of Σ\{p1 , p2 }. We first show the
following lemma.
Lemma 5.6. Let u¯ǫj be the average of uǫj (j = 1, 2). For any q ∈ (1, 2),
we have
uǫj − u¯ǫj converges to Gj in H 1,q (Σ),
where G1 and G2 satisfy


where δy is the Dirac distribution. Moreover,

uǫj − u¯ǫj converges to Gj in Cloc

(5.15)

Proof. First we show that for any q ∈ (1, 2),

Let q ′ > 2 be determined by

It follows that ∇uǫ1 Lq ≤ c1 . Similarly, we have ∇uǫ2
proves (5.16).
By Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.3, we can show that
ǫ

ǫ

Therefore, we have
∇(uǫ1 − u¯ǫ1 − G1 )

Lq

→ 0 as ǫ → 0.

It follows that uǫ1 − u¯ǫ1 − G1 Lq → 0 as ǫ → 0. Hence, we have
uǫ1 − u¯1ǫ → G1 in H 1,q (Σ). Similarly, uǫ2 − u¯ǫ2 → G2 in H 1,q (Σ). Now it
is easy to show (5.15). This proves the Lemma.
✷
Let γ be a smooth closed curve on Σ with the properties that Σ/γ
consists of two disjoint component Σ1 and Σ2 and p1 ∈ Σ1 and p2 ∈ Σ2 .

v1ǫ = (2uǫ1 + uǫ2 ) and

v2ǫ = (2uǫ2 + uǫ1 ).

Clearly, (v1ǫ , v2ǫ ) satisfies

Since uǫ2 is bounded from above in Σ1 , v˜2ǫ is bounded in C 1 (Σ1 ). Now
uǫ2 + u¯ǫ1 ) is also bounded in C 1 (Σ1 ).
it is easy to see that v2ǫ − v˜2ǫ − 13 (2¯

where (λǫ1 )2 = e−m1 . Since mǫ1 → ∞, λǫ1 → 0 as ǫ → 0. From the
discussion above, we know that u˜ǫ1 (0) = max u˜ǫ1 = 0 and u˜ǫ2 → −∞
uniformly on any compact domain of Σ1 .
1
Lemma 5.9. We have that u˜ǫ1 converges to φ0 in Hloc
(R2 ), where φ0 =
−2 log(1 + π|x|2 ) is a solution of the Liouville equation

−∆φ = 8πeφ .
Proof. Note that u˜ǫ = (˜
uǫ1 , u˜ǫ2 ) satisfies

in (λ1ǫ )−1 Bδ (xǫ1 )
(5.25)

Clearly, (λǫ1 )−1 Bδ (x1ǫ ) → R2 as ǫ → 0. For any large, but fixed constant
R > 0, we consider u˜ǫ on BR (0). Define ξRǫ by



ǫ

−∆ξRǫ = −(4π − ǫ)eu˜2 − (λǫ1 )2 (4π − ǫ) := fǫ

ξRǫ = 0,

in BR (0),
on ∂BR (0).

The elliptic estimate implies that ξRǫ → 0 in L∞ (BR (0)). Set w˜1ǫ =
u˜ǫ1 − ξRǫ . It is clear that
ǫ

ǫ

− ∆w˜1ǫ = (8π − 2ǫ)eξR ew˜1 .

(5.26)

Since u˜ǫ1 ≤ 0, u˜ǫ1 (0) = 0 and ξRǫ is bounded, w˜1ǫ is bounded from above
and |w˜1ǫ (0)| is bounded. It is easy to show that w˜1ǫ , hence u˜ǫ1 , converges
in H 1,2(BR ). (See, for example, [3].) Now by a diagonal argument, we
1,2
have that u˜ǫ1 converges to φ0 in Hloc
(R2 ), where φ0 satisfies
−∆φ0 = 8πeφ0
with φ0 (0) = 0 = max φ0 . A classification of Chen-Li [12] implies that
φ0 (x) = −2 log(1 + π|x|2 ).
✷
Now we need the following
Lemma 5.10. 1. For any small σ > 0, there exist constants Rσ > 0,
ǫσ > 0 and Cσ such that

This is (5.24). Here we have used the fact that

which can be deduced as follows. From (5.4), we have



ǫ

−∆hǫ = (8π − 2ǫ)eu1 ,
 hǫ

in Σ\Bδ (x1ǫ ),
on ∂Bδ (xǫ1 ).

Since uǫ1 is uniformly bounded from above in Σ\Bδ (xǫ1 ), hǫ is uniformly
bounded. Now applying the maximum principle to ue1 − hǫ , together
with Lemma 5.10, we can obtain that uǫ1 (x) ≤ −(1 − 3σ)mǫ1 + C for
any x ∈ Bδ (x1ǫ ), which implies (5.27).

Now it remains to prove Lemma 5.10.
