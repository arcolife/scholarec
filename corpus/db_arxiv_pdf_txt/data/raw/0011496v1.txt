Primordial chemistry began, at the recombination epoch, when the adiabatic expansion caused the
temperature of the radiation to fall below 4000K. The chemistry of the early Universe involves the
elements hydrogen, its isotope deuterium, helium with its isotopic forms and lithium. In this contribution I will discuss the influence of the primordial molecules on the cosmological decoupling.
In the framework of the gravitational instability theory, each protostructure started as a tiny local
overdensity. As long as these inhomogeneities are small, their evolution can be studied by the classical
linear perturbation theory. Once the deviations become large, the linear theory is no more valid. we
present the role played by these molecules on the transition between the linear regime and the nonlinear regime, and show that the molecules can lead to a thermal change at the turn-around point
between these two regimes.

1. Introduction
At early times the Universe was filled up with an extremely dense and hot gas. Due to
the expansion it cooled below the binding energies of hydrogen, deuterium, helium, lithium
which led to the formation of these nuclei (Sarkar 1996). After this nucleosynthesis period the
recombination process is not instantaneous because the electrons, captured into different atomic
energy levels, could not cascade instantaneously down to the ground state. Atoms reached the
ground state either through the cosmological redshifting of the Lyman α line photons or by
the 2s − 1s two photons process. Nevertheless the Universe expanded and cooled faster than
recombination could completed, and small fraction of free electrons and protons remained.
The principles of calculations of the primordial recombination have been mentionned initially
by Shklovskii (1967), Novikov & Zel’dovich (1967). Peebles (1968) was the first to present a
theory in which the very complicated recombination process is reduced to simpler terms (see
Puy & Signore 2000 for the historical description and references therein).
At the end of the recombination period, it is plausible to imagine that molecules could be
formed. Temperature of matter and radiation as well as the density are not so high and we
have possible collisional reactions between the species. However, in this cosmological context
we have metal-free gas which does not allow the efficient reaction of adsorption on the surface
of grains.
The literature on the chemistry in the post-recombination epoch has grown considerably in
the recent years. Many authors have developped studies of primordial chemistry in different
contexts. For example Lepp & Shull (1984), Latter & Black (1991), Puy et al. (1993), Stancil
et al. (1996), Galli & Palla (1998) for the chemical network; Palla, Galli & Silk (1995), Puy &
Signore (1996, 1997, 1998a, 1998b), Abel et al. (1997) and Galli & Palla (1998) in the context
of the formation of the first objects.
Chemistry of the early Universe is the gaseous chemistry of the hydrogen, helium, lithium
and electrons species. The efficiencies of the molecular formation processes is controlled by
collisions, matter temperature and temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The complete chemical network consists of 90 reactions (see Puy et al. 1993 and more recently
Galli & Palla 1998 and references therein).
Molecules could lead to radiative processes through the excitation of the rotational levels, and
contribute to the thermal evolution of the medium. Puy et al. (1993) examined the thermal
balance in the early Universe and showed that the molecular cooling and heating functions have
a slight influence on the decrease of the temperature of the matter. Nevertheless molecules
could play a more decisive role in the collapse of protoclouds, since molecular cooling can
trigger thermal instability prior the gravitational instability, as mentionned Puy & Signore
(1996, 1998a, 1998b). Protocloud evolute in three phases:
• linear evolution which approximatively follows expansion.
• turn-around epoch when the protocloud reaches its maximum value.
• non-linear evolution of the collapse.
At the turn-around point it is crucial to know the initial condition and particularly the temperature of the pre-collapse. In this contribution, I will recall the thermal function generated
by the primordial molecules (Sect. 2), then I will show the influence on the thermal decoupling
(Sect. 3). In Sect. 4, the role of the molecules on the turn-around point will be discussed and
a brief outlook will be presented in Sect. 5.

2. Molecular thermal function
The disappearance of free charged particles reduces the scattering cross-section (Thomson
scattering). The photons decouple from the rest of the matter; this happens at T = Tdec ∼ 0.26
eV where Tdec is the temperature of the matter corresponding to the redshift zdec ∼ 1100. After
the recombination, although the density-decrease acts against molecular formation, it turns out
that the temperature is small enough for this formation occur.
The chemical composition of the primordial gas consists of electrons, protons, hydrogen (H,
H − , H3+ , H2+ , H2 ), deuterium (D, D+ , HD, HD+ , H2 D+ ), helium (He , He+ , He++ , HeH + )
and lithium (Li, Li+ , Li− , LiH, LiH + ). Thus from the abundances of primordial atoms, given
by the standard model of nucleosynthesis (see Table 1), we integrate the network of coupled
chemical equations which is an initial value problem for stiff differential equations. Lepp &
Shull (1984), Puy et al. (1993) and more recently Galli & Palla (1998) calculated, as function
of redshift, the fractional abundances starting at the redshift z ∼ 104 where He, H, D and Li
are fully ionized.

Table 1. Initial abundances given by the standard of the nucleosynthesis (see Sarkar 1996).

The reaction rates depend on the temperature, thus the temperature and density evolution
equation must be solved simultaneously, which needs in turn the simultaneous determination of
molecular cooling and heating rates (see Puy et al. 1993, Galli & Palla 1998). The abundances
of the main molecules are obtained in Table 2.
The finite amount of primordial molecules, such as H2 , HD and LiH formed immediately
after the recombination of cosmological hydrogen can induce a thermal response of molecules
on the medium through the interaction with the radiation. The presence of non-zero permanent
electric dipole moment makes HD and LiH a potentially more important coolant than H2 at
modest temperatures, although HD and LiH are much less abundant than H2 . Below 3000

K, only the rotational levels of the molecules can be excited. The population of the rotational
levels is mainly due to collisional excitation and de-excitation with H, H2 and He on one hand
and to radiative processes (absorption from cosmic background radiation and spontaneous or
induced emission) on the other hand. Molecular cooling corresponds to collisional excitation
followed by radiative transition, provided that no further absorption occurs. Molecular heating
is due to the radiative excitation from cosmic microwave background followed by collisional
de-excitation. Notice that, although the radiative de-excitation is faster than collisional one
(because the excitation have the opposite ordering), the full cooling and heating processes
must be evaluated. Molecular thermal function Ψmolec , characterized by the two processes
(molecular heating and cooling), is defined by:
Ψmolec =

Ψk

(2.1)

k

where the index k is defined for each molecule (H2 , HD or LiH) and Ψk is the molecular
thermal function for the molecule k defined by:
x r

Pij ǫij in erg cm−3 s−1

nj

Ψk =

(2.2)

x
where nj and ni is respectively the population of the rotational level j and i. Cij
is the
rate of collision with the species x (with the density nx ), Bij the second Einstein coefficient,
uij the radiative density of cosmic microwave background radiation at the energy ǫij , which
corresponds to the transition between the levels i and j; Pijc and Pijr define respectively the
probability of collisional de-excitation and the probability of radiative de-excitation (here we
consider 10 rotational levels for each molecule). The first term of Eq. (2.2) corresponds to
molecular heating when the second term corresponds to molecular cooling.

3. Cosmological thermal decoupling
The evolution of the energy density ugas of a homogeneous gas is described by the equation:
3
(3.3)
nkTm = Qdt
2
where k is the Boltzmann constant, n the matter density, Tm the temperature of matter and Q
the external energy density which depends on the molecular thermal function Ψmolec , and on
the net transfer of energy Γcompt from the cosmic background radiation to the gas via Compton
scattering of cosmic background photons on electrons. Thus we have :
dugas = d

Q = Ψmolec + Γcompt ,

(3.4)

where (see Peebles 1968):
Γcompt =

4σT abb Tr4
ne Tr − Tm ).
me c

(3.5)

4

σT is the Thomson cross-section, abb is the black body constant, c the speed light, me the mass
of electron and ne the electronic density. Tr is the temperature of the radiation. Thus Eq.
(3.3) leads to the evolution of matter temperature Tm :

where Λad

defines the adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the Universe:
Λad = 3nkTm Ho (1 + z)3/2 ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

Ho is the Hubble constant (hereafter Ho = 67 Km s−1 Mpc−1 ) and z the redshift. We have
neglected the chemical heating and cooling due to the enthalpy of reactions (see Puy et al.
1993).
We adopt the standard cosmological model with zero cosmological constant (Einstein-De Sitter Universe). Thus the matter temperature Tm and the radiation temperature Tr remained
the same until a redshift of about 1100, the beginning of the recombination era, after which
Compton scattering was no longer able to overcome the cooling by expansion and Tm fell below
Tr . In this context the adiabatic cooling becomes dominant.
In Fig 1 Compton heating and thermal molecular function (in unit of adiabatic cooling) are
compared. The thermal molecular function, which is mainly a molecular heating, dominates
the Compton heating when z < 180. This fact should be important for the evolution of the
matter after this redshift, particularly for the collapse of the first objects.

4. Turn-around period and proto-collapse
We assume that, at some time in the past, there were small deviations from homogeneity
in our Universe. These deviations can grow due to gravitational instability. As long as these
inhomogeneities are small, their evolution can be studied by the classical linear perturbation
theory. Once the deviations from the homogeneous Universe become large, the linear theory

is no more valid. It is reasonable to expect that regions which are significantly overdense will
collapse and eventually form gravitationally bound objects. In these overdense regions, the
self-gravity of the local mass concentration will work against the expansion of the Universe;
i.e. this region expands at a progressively slower rate compared to the background Universe.
Such a slowing down will increase the density contrast between the overdense region and the
background Universe and, consequently, make the gravitational potential of the local mass
concentration more and more dominant. Eventually, such a region will collapse under its own
self-gravity and will form a bound system. The details of the above process will depend on the
initial density profile. The simplest model which one can study analytically is based on the
assumption that the overdense region is spherically symmetric.
Peebles (1980) described the transition between the linear regime (where the expansion of
the perturbation is maximum) and the non-linear regime (where the perturbation begins to
collapse) by introducing the turn-around point.
In an Einstein-De Sitter Universe, the temperature at the turn-around point (hereafter turnaround temperature) is given by
3π 4/3
Tm (zta )
(4.8)
4
where Tm (zta ) is the temperature of the matter at the redshift of the turn-around zta . Generally
it is assumed an isothermal perturbation described by the initial mass spectrum:
Tturn ∼

δρ
=
ρ

M
M⋆

α

(1 + z)−1 ,

(4.9)

where M is the mass of an overdense region (i.e. the mass of a cloud) and M⋆ = 1015 M⊙ is
a typical mass of a supercluster. Gott & Rees (1975) take α ∼ −1/3. Thus the redshift of the
turn-around is given by:
3π −2/3 M α
.
(4.10)
zta =
4
M⋆
It is crucial to know the temperature of the matter at the turn-around redshift in order to
evaluate the thermal initial condition of the collapse. We consider the same order of magnitude
for the mass of the fluctuations given by Lahav (1986) and Puy & Signore (1996) which
correspond to turn-around redshift in the range: 10 < zta < 150, which is the typical period
of the formation of the first objects.
The evolution of turn-around temperature is shown in Fig. 2 without and with the molecular
contributions, the evolution of radiation temperature is also plotted. We see two regimes
for the two turn-around temperatures: one corresponds to a temperature higher than the
radiation temperature Tr , the second is relative to temperature below Tr . It is important to
estimate the redshift zi where the turn-around temperature is equal to Tr , this point govern the
initial behaviour of the gas: if the turn-around temperature is below the radiation temperature
the gas heats, when the gas cools when the radiative temperature is below the turn-around
temperature. Thus this condition is located at the redshift zi ∼ 130 in the case without
molecules and zi ∼ 105 in the case with molecules. Another interesting point is the point
which corresponds to the turn-around redshift z = 55. This redshift corresponds to a typical
value 109 M⊙ of a collapsing mass (see Puy & Signore 1997). We find (see Fig 2) that the turnaround temperature Tturn ∼ 70 K without molecules and Tturn ∼ 100 K for the turn-around
temperature with molecules. The consequences could be important if we notice that the lower
excitation temperature for HD (main thermal molecular function) is 112 K (close to 100 K) .

5. Outlook
This work shows a possible thermal modification, due to the primordial molecules, at the
beginning of the collapse. This thermal mechanism could modify the initial conditions of a
gravitational collapse. The following analysis could reveal processes of fragmentation trigerred
by the thermal molecular function (see Puy & Signore 1997, 1998b). This last point is crucial
for the estimation of the amplitude of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies.
Dubrovich (1977, 1993) showed that resonant elastic scattering must be considered as the most
efficient process in coupling matter and radiation at high redshift. He noted that the cross
section for resonant scattering between the cosmic microwave background and molecules is
several orders of magnitude larger than Thomson scattering, even with a modest abundance
of primordial molecules. Let us only emphasize that, again at present times, the primordial
molecules abundance and the reaction rate of the chemical reaction are both quite uncertain.
