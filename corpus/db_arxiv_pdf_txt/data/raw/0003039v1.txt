LIEB-THIRRING INEQUALITIES – In- (by considering V (x) = λW (x) with W smooth and
equalities concerning the negative eigenvalues of the λ → ∞) that

Lγ,n ≥ Lγ,n
An interesting, and mostly open problem is to determine the sharp value of the constant Lγ,n , especially to find those cases in which Lγ,n = Lcγ,n .
M. Aizenman and Lieb [1] proved that the ratio
Rγ,n = Lγ,n /Lcγ,n is a monotonically non-increasing
function of γ. Thus, if RΓ,n = 1 for some Γ then
Lγ,n = Lcγ,n for all γ ≥ Γ. The equality L 23 ,n = Lc3 ,n

was proved for n = 1 in [13] and for n > 1 in [8] by
A. Laptev and T. Weidl. (See also [2].)
The following sharp constants are known:

Lγ,1 = √

The cases γ > 21 , n = 1, γ > 0, n ≥ 2, were established by E.H. Lieb and W.E. Thirring [13] in connection with their proof of stability of matter. The
case γ = 12 , n = 1 was established by T. Weidl [16].
The case γ = 0, n ≥ 3 was established independently
by M. Cwikel [4], Lieb [9] and G.V. Rosenbljum [14]
by different methods and is known as the CLR bound;
the smallest known value for L0,n is in [9], [11].
Closely associated with the inequality (1) is the
semi-classical approximation for
|e|γ , which serves
as a heuristic motivation for (1). It is (cf. [13]).

Instead of considering all the negative eigenvalues
as in (1), one can consider just e1 . Then for γ as in

V (x)γ+n/2 dx .
Rn

Clearly, L1γ,n ≤ Lγ,n , but equality can hold, as in
the cases γ = 1/2 and 3/2 for n = 1. Indeed, the
conjecture in (3) amounts to L1γ,1 = Lγ,1 for 1/2 <
γ < 3/2. The sharp value (3) of L1γ,n is obtained
by solving a differential equation [13]. It has been
conjectured that for n ≥ 3, L0,n = L10,n . In any case,
B. Helffer and D. Robert showed that for all n and
all γ < 1, Lγ,n > Lcγ,n .
The sharp constant L10,n , n ≥ 3 is related to the
sharp constant Sn in the Sobolev inequality

By a ‘duality argument’ [13] the case γ = 1 in

ter [12], [13]. Let f1 , f2 , . . . be any orthonormal se0
quence (finite or infinite) in L2 (Rn ) such that ∇fj ∈
L2 (Rn ) for all j ≥ 1. Associated with this sequence Assuming V = −V (since V+ only raises the eigenis a ‘density’
values), NE (V ) is most accessible via the positive
semidefiniate Birman-Schwinger kernel (cf. [15])

e < 0 is an eigenvalue of H if and only if 1 is an
eigenvalue of K|e| (V ). Furthermore, KE (V ) is operator monotone decreasing in E, and hence NE (V )
equals the number of eigenvalue of KE (V ) that are
greater than 1.
An important generalization of (1) is to replace −∆
in H by |i∇ + A(x)|2 , where A(x) is some arbitrary
vector field in Rn (called a magnetic vector potential). Then (1) still holds but it is not known if the
sharp value of Lγ,n changes. What is known is that
all presently known values of Lγ,n are unchanged. It is
also known that (−∆+ E)−1 , as a kernel in Rn × Rn ,
is pointwise greater than the absolute value of the
kernel (|i∇ + A|2 + E)−1 .
There is another family of inequalities for orthonormal functions, which is closely related to (1) and to
the CLR bound [10]. As before, let f1 , f2 , . . . , fN be
N orthonormal functions in L2 (Rn ) and set

dx . (6)

Rn

This can be extended to antisymmetric functions in
L2 (RnN ). If Φ = Φ(x1 , . . . , xN ) is such a function we
define, for x ∈ Rn ,
ρ(x) = N
Rn(N −1)

Then, if

Note that the choice Φ = (N !)−1/2 det fj (xk )|N
j,k=1
with fj orthonormal reduces the general case (7) to
(6).
If the conjecture L1,3 = Lc1,3 is correct then the
bound in (7) equals the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy ansatz, and hence it is a challenge to prove this
conjecture. In the meantime, see [11], [3] for the best
available constants to date (1998).
Of course, (∇f )2 = f (−∆f ). Inequalities of the
type (7) can be found for other powers of −∆ than
the first power. The first example of this kind, due
to I. Daubechies [5], and one of√the most important
physically, is to replace −∆ by −∆ in H. Then an
inequality similar to (1) holds with γ + n/2 replaced
by γ + n (and with a different Lγ,n1 , of course). Likewise there is an analogue of (7) with 1 + 2/n replaced
by 1 + 1/n.
All proofs of (1) (except [7] and [16])actually proceed by finding an upper bound to NE (V ), the number of eigenvalues of H = −∆ + V (x) that are below

uj is a Riesz potential (m = 0) or Bessel potential (m > 0) of fj . If n = 1 and m > 0 then,
ρ ∈ C 0,1/2 (Rn ) and ρ L∞ (R) ≤ L/m.
If n = 2 and m > 0 then for all 1 ≤ p < ∞
ρ Lp (R2 ) ≤ Bp m−2/p N 1/p .
If n ≥ 3, p = n/(n − 2) and m ≥ 0 (including
m = 0) then ρ Lp (Rn ) ≤ An N 1/p .
Here, L, Bp , An are universal constants. Without
the orthogonality, N 1/p would have to be replaced
by N . Further generalizations are possible [10].
